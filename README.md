## **Dynamic  Topic Modelling**
This involves the observation and analysis of topics evolution over time using a collection of scientific methods. This allows you to understand how a topic(s) is/are evolving across different time intervals. Imagine a topic talking about technology, words used in the 1950s is likely to be more different from words in the 2000s. The topic remains the same but the exact representation of that topic might differ.

**Aim**

In this project, Dynamic Topic Modelling (DTM) was used to understand how topics were formed over time from scraped amazon reviews ranging from 2018 to 2022.
