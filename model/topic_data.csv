the_review,year,month
I wish I would have gotten one earlier. I love it and it makes working in my laptop so much easier,2022,10
"I've learned this lesson (again). Open the package and use the product right away. I ordered this mouse in August as my 'travel' mouse and just packed it away in my bag. Now, I've been visiting family in the PNW since mid-September. The mouse took a charge and worked fine for a couple of weeks. After I recharged the mouse, it worked for a day or two and then ceased to function. The optical light will flash once when turned on then.... nothing. Of course, the return window is well past.",2022,10
It is so slow and lags find a better option,2022,10
Roller ball stopped working within 4 months of minimal use.  Piece of junk.,2022,10
I like the color and size but it’s a few days out of the return period and it will not hold a charge,2022,10
"Overall I love this mouse. The size, weight, clicking is all fabulous. However I’ve had two of these now and the middle scroller has randomly fallen in without rough use, it wasn’t dropped, literally was not even touching it the second time and I heard it fall. If you need to use the middle scroller a lot I do not recommend purchase. If you don’t use that feature then it’s a great mouse.",2022,10
It stopped working,2022,10
"My son uses a school issued Chromebook for school work and hates using the touch pad to navigate the mouse. So we looked into a wireless mouse and found this one had so many good reviews. Unfortunately, the scrolling wheel has already broken and he has only used it a month. Since he only uses it for his school computer it mostly stayed stored safely in the carrying case. He was not rough with it and it was stored carefully when not in use. I am really disappointed because he loved the color and paid for this with his own money earned helping his grandmother over the summer at a campground. There is an email on the bottom of the mouse that says lifetime replacement but I have tried twice now to email them about it and it keeps bouncing back as undeliverable. I am sure this has been a great product for many and we likely got the dud so I am not telling anyone not to buy it but I am sharing our experience for others to consider.",2022,10
Loved this cute little mouse but it broke after 2 months. The wheel broke off from the gear.,2022,10
Should've spent the money to get a quality product. This thing stopped working after about a week. Worthless,2022,10
"Beautifully produced and lovely to look at for a mouse.  The lights are a welcome addition to an otherwise drab workspace.  I did notice that it tends to go into a sleep mode quickly, but takes a longer ‘wake up’ time than I expect.  On a screen busy with windows, the cursor freezes in position until the mouse fully comes back to life.  It’s frustrating for anyone who isn’t patient.",2022,10
First one broke in 1 week they sent a replacement and I returned broken one and it still hasn’t processed return now new one broke 2 weeks later.  I would not recommend this mouse,2022,10
I don't typically write reviews but I keep having this issue with tech products from amazon. The mouse stopped working after 2 months of use. It charges and sometimes I can get short term use out of it but it's very glitchy and lags across the screen.,2022,10
I liked the wireless mouse however after 3 months the roller on the mouse stopped working which leaves me not being able to scroll up or down on my pc. I’ll have to look into buying a more sturdy mouse.,2022,10
The wheel from the mouse not working anymore. It only lasted for about 2 months. Really nice mouse but doesn't last.,2022,10
"Nothing but issues the scroll wheel broke for no reason at all, no longer holds a charge. Would not recommend!!!",2022,10
Wouldn’t recommend have been trying to charge it for days!,2022,10
"I bought this in late June, it looks cool with the lights and all. It doesn't give a warning that the battery is low, just stops working. Now it is doing all kinds of weird stuff, clicking on items that you didn't, etc. Too late to return...oh well...not recommended.",2022,10
After a few weeks the scroll wheel stopped working. I'm returning it.,2022,10
This is the second time I have ordered this mouse. I actually really like the mouse except for the fact that they keep breaking and I have to order a new one. So for that reason I am only going to give you two stars. I ordered this particular mouse only two months ago and it’s already broken.  I should get my money back.,2022,10
Excellent for price!,2022,10
Disappointed in this mouse. The wheel broke after 7 months.,2022,10
It felt like it would break easily and the texture of the mouse would get dirty quickly.,2022,10
"Bought this mouse on December 2021. Its October 2022 and no matter how long I charge it, the only thing it does is blink the red light once and die. Don't recommend this at all.",2022,10
"It works ok.  Nothing spectacular.  If you're a gamer or use the mouse quite a bit, you have to charge it about once a day, or it starts lagging and causes things to crash or freeze up due to the lag.",2022,10
Unfortunately this mouse stopped working after a month of use. Can I replace the item or get a refund?,2022,10
I had no issues with the mouse but I dropped it from not even 2ft from the ground (on accident of course) and the spin wheel and the left clicker broke. I’ve ordered another one and I hope it lasts longer than this one did.,2022,10
Bought 7 months ago now I have to charge it every other day.,2022,10
"like design not function ,,, frustrating",2022,10
We tried several different ways to charge it and it would not hold a charge over 30 minutes. :(,2022,10
I bought this mouse to go with my work laptop when I have to travel to sites. I HATE using the pad that is built into the laptop. This is cute and little. I am thinking about using it for my personal laptop when gaming or doing school work.,2022,10
Got two of these with colors that matched out tablets. Easy to transport and just right feel in my hand. So far they work perfectly and at what I would consider a great price.,2022,10
The mouse wheel broke and just spins now.  I used this for my work laptop and loved it but if this is the quality it is I will not buy another,2022,10
"I liked this product, until is stopped working 4 months later.",2022,10
"I’ve actually purchased two of these and both broke in the same way, the scroller. I do not recommend if you need them for any kind of gaming that requires the scroller. I need to use it for camera angles in game and without it gameplay is awful. I won’t be buying a third one, BUT if that’s not gonna be a problem for you then these will probably be great. They hold a charge well and the light show they put on is really cool.",2022,10
Easy to use,2022,10
" It's an excellent product. If you're looking for a wireless mouse, a good price and with high load durability, that's correct. I use it for work in ArcGis. Excellent service",2022,10
"As a lot of other reviewers said, the scroll wheel broke. I have had a different USB mouse for years without this problem. I'll be going back to it.The battery life is also very short. I'm constantly having to recharge it.",2022,10
FIrst time that I need to change the battery and it doesnt work anymore!!!  NO duro NI 6 Meses!!!,2022,10
Quit working after 6 months. Can't get it to work anymore charging port is messed up I have unplugged it once.,2022,10
Repeatedly and without proper functioning my mouse turned on for 1 second then turned right back off again after being plugged into the laptop overnight.  I searched for power issue reviews and found I am not the only one.  I cannot recommend this product and feel it should be taken down due to this.,2022,10
Stopped working 1 month after I received this,2022,10
"Didn’t, work, would not charge",2022,10
This is exactly what I needed. My favorite features are the quite clicks and the led lights.,2022,10
I got this less and two months ago and I LOVED it.... until today when it broke when I touched the wheel.,2022,10
"It was cute and worked super well while it lasted but about 6 weeks into using it, it just stops. Doesn’t hold a charge, doesn’t stay on. Of course it lasts beyond when you can return it so just don’t take the chance.",2022,10
It already doesn't work,2022,10
"I have had this a few months and loved it, but now the roller to scroll is not working.",2022,10
Haven’t had it long. USB-C adapter is already broken so my mouse is currently unusable on my MacBook. Mouse is decent but seems to not hold a charge very long when I was using it.,2022,10
I purchased this mouse back in June of this year. It is now October. The battery life is soo powerful. The color changing is the best experience I could have ha with a mouse. I can't believe how happy I am with this purchase.,2022,10
"The center scroll wheel broke in 3 weeks for no reason. Mouse was not dropped and barely used. Garbage, so you get what you pay for.",2022,10
"Charged all night, and only last few minutes.This mouse has pretty design, but it's too thin to hold.Just asked for refund but not replaced.",2022,10
This worked for a few months. I had to charge it overnight 2x a week as I work from home and used this mouse for my work laptop. After several months it stopped holding a charge and would have to be charged daily. Now it won’t charge or work. Super annoying because I really need a mouse and now I have to order another one. I had hoped this would last a LOT longer than 5 months but now I’m putting plastic into the landfill and it sucks.,2022,10
"You could think it's a decent mouse for the price you paid. But, in reality, it is an uncomfortable mouse and barely works. The only good thing about this mouse is that it comes with a USB to USB-c adapter, which comes in handy.",2022,10
"A very reasonably priced cordless, rechargeable mouse with 3-button control with scroll wheel, which is my preference rather than the MacBookAir track pad or the Mac Mouse for the desktop Mac.",2022,10
"I would buy it against n. It’s pretty, not really bling, just sleek.",2022,10
It has a soft touch,2022,10
The scroll feature on the mouse broke 2 weeks after the return period otherwise I like it.,2022,10
Its a nice mouse but i'm not sure if its good for gaming.,2022,10
cool and easy to use at first. but broke with in a few weeks of use.,2022,10
This product simply doesn’t work. The charger connection port is mishapen.,2022,10
"I hated this item, they described how easy it was to use and I received mine and it does not connect. after doing my research on it , its suppose to be compatible with my laptop and its not, so now I have to order a different one, im very disappointed in this product.",2022,10
"Feels very cheap. Wouldn’t charge on my laptop, had to plug it in on my desktop to charge it. Finally got it charged just for it to die after 2 hours of non-continuous use. It’s getting returned.",2022,10
My first one I had about 2 weeks and the wheel broke loose and it would not work. I received a replacement in two days and it's perfect! Can't blame them for a manufacturing issue. I love my pink mouse. I highly recommend it. I use it 8 hours a day 5 days a week.,2022,10
It works well.  It does what I purchased it for.,2022,10
Scroll interior post broke causing the mouse to no longer work. Bought in Jan 2022 broke Oct 2022. Otherwise nice functioning overall,2022,10
"I purchased this mouse as the wheel on my old one quit working, I loved the design and wanted another so I ordered it and received it Aug 31, 2022 It is Oct 17, 2022, and the wheel just quick working again.  I would recommend looking at a different mouse if you prefer your scrolling feature.",2022,10
This item is poorly made. Battery died within 40 minutes after full charge (3 hours) It was returned the same day it was delivered.,2022,10
"Mouse worked fine for 3 months, charged it every week or so. Then wouldn't charge via USB. Not good option for those who need something reliable.",2022,10
"Received product on the 12th, charged it and started using it. The charge didn't last that long maybe a day at most. But today (10/17/22) it doesn't work at all. Glad I kept my old battery one.",2022,10
"This mouse was great, up until today when the scroll finger pad completely broke? The scroll function is loose and now wont work at all :(",2022,10
I've had this for a month and a half it's stopped working.  I've tried charging repeatedly and it does nothing.,2022,10
This worked great for 5 months then one day just stopped working...,2022,10
Worked well for the first few weeks then Broke right after return window closed.,2022,10
"It was ok for a cheap mouse, it started lagging after a few months, and eventually quit working over all",2022,10
Broke in less than 2 months. Scrolling won't workWouldn't recommendQuit right outside the return window,2022,10
Ergonomic and fits my hand well.Pretty when charged.***mine doesn’t hold a charge well. It only lasts a couple hours at most.,2022,10
Certainly helps to look at instructional pictures and to try to translate what the instructions mean,2022,10
The little wheel broke within the 2nd day,2022,10
Performs as expected,2022,10
"Mouse seems to work ok. Looks nice, easy install, etc, Biggest complaint is the time out and wake up feature. Every time I go to use the PC, it's asleep. Then have to either click a button (which may/may not cause an action on the PC) or pick it up and down several times. Too annoying so stopped using it. Might keep it aside for use with my laptop when traveling, Definitely not for daily use.",2022,10
"Not bad, would rather have purchased apple",2022,10
The box came absolutely smashed and the mouse doesn’t work with the USB-C adapter that’s included with it.,2022,10
Broke within a week.,2022,10
"This is slim, quiet and I absolutely love the changing of colors. Best mouse I've had !!",2022,10
This worked great at first but have to keep it on power or it will only last about 2 hours after about 5 months.,2022,10
I bought this mouse to match the keyboard I bought for my daughter to use with her laptop. She does online school and likes having a mouse as well as a keyboard. She likes that they match and both light up. I didn't know how it would be for gaming.,2022,10
Very easy to use and sleek design. It is small enough to fit easily into my computer bag when I have to take it with me.,2022,10
Good feel and ergonomics but scroll wheel broke at six weeks. Design/plastic quality selection does not live up to common everyday use.,2022,10
"This is nice little mouse, very quiet clicking, and I get lots of compliments on the changing color lights.",2022,10
Did not work with intended laptop,2022,10
"Sleek, ergonomic feel, quiet clicker. Easy to charge, USB easy to install. Would definitely recommend for the price!",2022,10
I just purchased this mouse to use with my new laptop and am impressed with the quietness of the buttons and it has helped me win on my games,2022,10
"Love the clickity clicks of the mouse, got it for my daughter for online school work and she loves the damn thing.",2022,10
"This mouse would not connect to my compute despite multiple attempts following the instructions given. As is typical of many Amazon products, this product is cheaply made and not worth wasting your money on.I would suggest avoiding making purchases from this brand in the future, and strongly suggest NOT BUYING THIS MOUSE. Unless throwing money away on broken pieces of junk that don't work is a past time of yours. Then knock yourself out.",2022,10
Bought the item and scroll button and left button stopped working after about 3 months of use,2022,10
Very ergonomic,2022,10
"Item worked fine for 5 months and then no longer would turn on. And yes, it was fully charged. Of course it was past the return date, so its basically junk... Save your money and buy a name brand",2022,10
"The mouse is very slim but is so cheaply made don't dare drop it or it's going to break, I won't by another one",2022,10
" Bought this mouse for my office to go with the theme and love it, was kind of frustrated at first because it was tricky getting it to come on but after holding the two buttons it worked. Great purchase.",2022,10
"These things stop working after a few weeks! I got two and one it just refuses to charge or stay on. The other, the scroller fell! Very poorly made! DO NOT PURCHASE!",2022,10
"I like how slim it is, and the colors are a nice touch without being distracting. Clicking is responsive, though the movement was a little glitchy (for me) sometimes. My biggest complaint is that the USB sticks out super far if you have to use the USB-C adapter.",2022,10
"I was super exited for this to come, and it worked for about five minuted! The only thing that worked was the USB to type-C adapter!😠",2022,10
I used it for a month and then it stopped working..,2022,10
"Love the color, love how it changes colors and love how it holds a charge!",2022,10
"I bought this mouse because it said it was rechargeable and I wouldn’t have to remember to always have batteries around. I used it for a few days and once the better inside died, I went to recharge it. I charged it for 5+ hours (even though it says the charge time is 2-3 hours) and then went to go use it and it does not work",2022,10
"Put one star because this store sent me a bad mouse twice. the first was working, then not working. the next did not work at all. Just wasted time and money.",2022,10
I love the sleep mode. So easy to use.,2022,10
Works on MacBook Pro.,2022,10
"I loved this little mouse. It looked great. It felt great in my hand. The wheel was nice for scrolling. The battery even held a charge for what I thought was a reasonable amount of time. I would categorize my usage as light-moderate use (and no abuse).Then came the day, about a month after arrival, right after the return window closed, that it started glitching. Now, it drops off, not responding, then will work again, then drop off again and I’m not talking about sleep mode- this is during active use. Back and forth. Back and forth. It’s frustrating, probably more because I so desperately want a mouse instead of my laptop’s trackpad.All that said, I didn’t spend a whole lot of money on this mouse, so I get what I pay for. I just wish I had gotten a little more than a month before the glitching.",2022,10
The scroll button broke after just a month. Would not recommend,2022,10
"I was happy with this purchase until the mouse wheel quit working. I purchased this device on July 24, 2022 and a week ago (September 2022) it quit working. After looking through the questions, I see others have experienced this too. I wouldn't purchase this item. It's a known issue.",2022,10
"I got this for my mother because she wanted something pink and cheap. It really feels like its made of trash. It does seem to work well enough, though the tracking is inconsistent at best. The ergonomics are really non existent, doesn't seem like it's made for human hands.Overall, if you're buying for somebody who wants something cheap and pink and cant tell the difference go for it, but if you actually care about having a half decent mouse skip this one.",2022,10
Like it’s size. Perfect fit for laptop bag,2022,10
"Nice mouse, a little too lightweight for my liking. Battery lasts a while.Track wheel already broke, unfortunately.",2022,10
"The on/off switch often feels like there is sand in the mouse when moving it, it’s not a smooth move like I would have expected. I like the mouse but that roughness is annoying at times.",2022,10
It’s taken me a while to remember to turn it on after it sits awhile.,2022,10
you get what  you pay for,2022,10
I bought one and the piece going into my laptop didn’t work. The second broke easily.,2022,10
very good product.,2022,10
I love this mouse it’s quiet and pretty and the battery lasts a while I probably charge it once maybe twice a week,2022,10
"It’s ergonomic and stylish. Very cute colors and cool lights. Comes with all the attachments like cords for charging and it has a small indent under the mouse to keep the part that plugs into your laptop. I’m forever losing mine so that’s a great feature. Very quiet as well. I recommend it for a nice, cheap little mouse.",2022,10
Amazing feels cheap but is very durable,2022,10
"Very nice mouse , love the size and feel",2022,10
Very cheap mouse. Connectivity is poor at times.,2022,10
love the colors so far ok,2022,10
"i love the different colors, easy to find at night.  holds a charge for a few days.",2022,10
"Soft, light, smooth.",2022,10
I like how light and easy to handle is!,2022,10
Love it,2022,10
"I only had this item for a month if that, and it has already stopped working. It will not hold a charge and it is not the cable. I shouldn’t have ignored the other comments about it not working. Don’t make my same mistake!",2022,10
its a slick well made mouse and i will be buying another one thanks to manufacturer for nice creativity in build!!,2022,10
"I really liked this mouse when I first got it. It was low profile, had a nice soft and quiet click, had rainbow lights, and was available in a rose gold color. I thought I'd made a great purchase. Now, I've had it for less than 2 months and the scroll wheel is so squeaky. I can't stand to hear it when I'm scrolling through documents. Bummed it was a lemon!",2022,10
i use the mouse instead of mousepad,2022,10
very nice,2022,10
Prompt delivery on an awesome product,2022,10
"The colors were great while it worked. The wheel broke, and the usb fell apart when pulling it out of the computer.",2022,10
Bought one at first broke within a couple of months thinking maybe it was my daughter Bought another and broke again within a couple of months  the middle wheel on the mouse is defective and it the same problem from the first one I bought,2022,10
"Lightweight mouse, easy to charge, CAN USE WHILE CHARGING, and I like the teal color I got with fun colors lighting up. Makes my office work and time at the computer feel a little less boring. Easy to connect and works well with iMac.",2022,10
"so sad - been using for ~2 months only, and the scroll wheel broke already. bye bye scrolling feature. kind of a turn off to use it now that its broken",2022,10
"You have to press down very hard on the mouse, it gets very annoying. I wish I still had the box I’d return it",2022,10
Perfect little mouse! This mouse is so easy to use and to charge up it’s lightweight I love the little colors and it fits my hand perfectly,2022,10
"This product only lasted 4 days, I thought it was not charged but it not that",2022,10
"I don’t use this mouse often, and the mouse has completely failed. Won’t turn on, it does light up when it is charging but won’t turn on and stay on. Completely unusable. Pretty big bummer since I’m past return.. I do not recommend.",2022,10
Perfect in my office love the lightweight and easy to use.,2022,10
"The mouse worked great, until one day, it stopped scrolling. I've had it just about month...the rest of the mouse seems to be working but the scroll wheel is no longer responsive.",2022,10
"Do not buy this!!! I bought this in August 21st, return period is only 30 days and it stopped working in October 3rd. Tried different charging cords thought maybe it was the cord. But no lock just completely dead.",2022,10
The mouse has good shape and charges quickly but the roll just broke after one week of use,2022,10
Sleep mode works well,2022,10
"Simple to use.  Long battery life.  recharges by plugging into your computer.  This is the first mouse i've enjoyed using that wasn't wired.  This works much better than the old battery opperated ones, and has a much longer battery life.",2022,10
It's a no for me.,2022,10
Lasted a little over  a month and the scroll wheel stopped working.,2022,10
It doesn't stay charged for very long,2022,10
"Just plugged it in and it worked perfectly.  I wanted a small, low profile mouse to use when I travel, so far this one seems great.  The Chromebook I travel with only has usb-C ports, and I did think that that this mouse came with a usb-c receiver, but it doesn't.  It comes with usb receiver and an adapter which works fine but together they are over an inch long which is a little awkward.  It means I have to be very careful not to bump it and beak it.  If the receiver were smaller this would be ideal.  Overall, great value.",2022,10
Quiet and just what I was looking for,2022,10
"It was great to begin with. For the price I wasn’t expecting a lot. However, the scroll wheel quit working within the first 5 times of using it which is one of the reasons I purchased it to begin with 🥲",2022,10
The mic stopped working and charging after a few weeks,2022,10
"It looks awesome and is really quiet. only had it for a short time, but I love it.",2022,10
Terrible product!! First mouse broke within a week. Second mouse broke within 6 months!,2022,10
This is broken within a month.,2022,10
Mine stopped working… it doesn’t work on a mouse pad. And freezes when I use it on top of a flat surface.,2022,10
"Cheap, broke after 2 months",2022,10
The product is cheap and worked well for the first 2 months,2022,09
Stopped working in less than a week.  Just up and died...and now it has to be returned and look for another one.  Save yourself the effort and keep on lookin'...this ain't it!,2022,09
"Battery takes forever to die which is great, sleep mode helps a lot. It’s thinner and smoother than any other mouse I’ve own. Love the lights!!!!",2022,09
Purchased two. Works as described.You can't beat this price.Highly recommend!,2022,09
"I got it for my husband, he chose his colors lol",2022,09
I like that it does not need batteries. The battery lasts a long time.,2022,09
"I read the other reviews and it seems great.I fully charge mine and it last a few hours.If the charge lasted, this would be a good mouse.I have to rate mine a 'one'.",2022,09
"Right out of the box, the mouse never worked. The buttons activate, but the mouse never moved the cursor.  Junk.",2022,09
Very good,2022,09
"I bought one for my laptop and 2 days after I got it, the wheel stopped working and I could hear something loose inside it. I returned it for a replacement. The new one seems to be working fine, although sometimes the cursor glides smoothly across the screen and other times it jumps around a lot. Maybe this is just something wireless mice do? I don't know; I've never had one before.",2022,09
Tried 3 times using this in the week I've had it.  I even checked to make sure it was fully charged.Turned it off/on several times and no improvement. Movement of cursor is very slow/delayed.  Very disappointed with functionality.  I went back to using my battery operated mouse.,2022,09
"Initially I thought it’s a great piece but slowly I am struggling to use it as it stops working or goes to sleep for long. I does not get activated by just simply moving a bit, has to moved few times or even hit it on pad at time.",2022,09
"I bought this for my work laptop and I really like it.  The coloring changing option is fun, but I don’t turn that on very often so the charge lasts longer.  I have small hands and it fits my hand comfortably.",2022,09
"I got this in June and it’s now the end of September. It was great at first and lasted multiple days on a charge, but now the battery dies after just a couple of hours. And it dies randomly without any warning so it’s always in the middle of using it. Frustrating, this lasted maybe 3 months in total",2022,09
The c-type converter from this item wasn’t working so I had to use the one I had. Everything else was working good other than that.,2022,09
Love this mouse it has a sleek design and works wonderful! Love the quietness and the perfect fit for my small hands.,2022,09
Nice mouse and l like that the mouse sleeps to save the battery.,2022,09
"looks like the track wheel is connected to an internal device using a very fragile thin piece of plastic.  I was simply using the mouse (I didn't drop it or slam it) and suddenly the tactile feedback of using the track wheel stopped and the mouse would no longer scroll the screen.  too bad, I actually liked the mouse until then.",2022,09
Mouse is nice and lightweight and quiet. But its lags and jumps around sometimes,2022,09
Stopped working a few weeks after purchase.,2022,09
"I admit I was going to return this item because I did not understand the little USB attachment was on the bottom of the device.  I had charged it, but was using the little black USB insert in my laptop which did not work.  Once I inserted the white short USB from underneath the pointer, my computer accepted it and it works great!  I am still learning how to use these devices at age 74.  It is gorgeous and works!",2022,09
Mouse works well and is a good value for the inexpensive price.,2022,09
"Ordered this mouse in early September 2021, as of today it no longer holds a charge.I bought this mouse to have something portable to go along with my laptop as I generally dislike using the trackpad. It's size was ideal and it was overall comfortable and easy to use. However, this mouse does not hold a charge AT ALL. I had to charge it at least twice per week - remember this is not a mouse I used on my primary computer either! (and yes I do turn it off when it is stored in my bag.)Not thrilled that I now have to replace it after only 1 year of use and will not be purchasing again.",2022,09
"i am rating this negatively because the scroll button didn't last more than two weeks, it didnt even fall, i woke up to use my mouse only to discover the scroll wheel wasn't working. i feel like i wasted money on this purchase",2022,09
Love the mouse and it's quick connectivity to the computer. Not happy the scroll bottom quit working.,2022,09
glitchy and charge doesn't last,2022,09
"Nice size, color is true to expectation. Easy use and setup. Has usbc adapter included for newer hardware. USB adapter fits in base of mouse. Works well on multiple surfaces. Quick charging.",2022,09
Works great,2022,09
It stopped working within 2 days of use.,2022,09
It felt like a cheap product upon arrival and usage. After 2 months and no longer charges and is absolutely useless.,2022,09
As expected. Would buy again,2022,09
"I’ve had this mouse for almost 10 months. It worked so well and the color changing lights add a little pizazz. Unfortunately, the scroll wheel stopped working. It no longer has tension on it. It just spins now and moves nothing on the screen :(",2022,09
Turns itself off and battery doesn't last a whole work day.,2022,09
I work from home and this mouse is very comfortable and responsive.,2022,09
It did not come with a USB cable to charge the mouse. I wasted my money.,2022,09
This mouse is much faster than my last few. I like the charging system. Drawback is when the charger comes missing( and it will happen in my house) how to replace it?,2022,09
Works like it should and it’s super easy to set up.,2022,09
Unfortunately the scroll function is already broken. Otherwise this is a very cute and comfy mouse. I love the lights.,2022,09
I got this mouse and i charged it like it said to but when i went to use it it doesn't even work. I would not recomend anyone to get this mouse.,2022,09
Beautiful!,2022,09
"Didn't hold a charge long, but now won't recharge at all, just threw it in the trash.Had a battery operated mouse for 5 years until I lost it. Going back to batteries.",2022,09
"I purchased this mouse thinking it had a USB-C connector, not a USB with a USB-C adaptor (my bad). I opted to keep it. Three stars on its scrolling as it was not smooth, but it worked.  I would have kept it, but after a couple of weeks, it died and would not charge despite being plugged in for hours.  Don't waste your money; go with a tried and true brand",2022,09
I used it for about six weeks and it stopped working,2022,09
"Honestly waste of money. Didn’t charge, after 2 hours, and just didn’t work.",2022,09
it is easy to use,2022,09
"This works like a normal mouse and everything! However, the light that's in the mouse is so bright, it shines through the white on my mouse. It's not good aesthetically, however, if you want a mouse that does mouse things, this one's fine.",2022,09
Great item,2022,09
Great product,2022,09
Dropped this mouse once from desk to carpet and the scroll button broke. I guess you get what you pay for...,2022,09
"Love this mouse overall- beautiful lights, fits well in hand, responsive - but wheel broke after less than one month of regular use for design work. Very sad. This is the second mouse I've bought (first lasted 6 months, same issue) because I like it so much. Unfortunately, will be looking for something different for my next mouse.",2022,09
Just over a month old and the roller no longer functions.  I realize these are cheap…but a month?  Use exclusively for work…not heavy use…,2022,09
Had it for three months and it was working fine. Loved that the click was quiet and it was lightweight. But it stopped charging and working out of nowhere.,2022,09
This is the worst mouse ever!!!!,2022,09
"I wanted a product that I thought I’d have for at least the semester. Since I’ve purchased it, the ball that scrolls down/up is no longer working. Makes a mouse almost pointless to have. Seems am going to need a new mouse.",2022,09
The wheel for scrolling breaks to easily. This is the second one that I’ve purchased with the same issue. I will try another brand.,2022,09
The scrolling wheel is not working properly after 5 months so have to buy a new mouse. The USB charging feature is nice though and it is easy to carry.,2022,09
VERY COMFOT,2022,09
"Love this mouse. Take it anywhere, it's classy yet a little sexy for my workspace. It's very adaptable to who needs it in my house for their devices!",2022,09
Holds a charge for days!!,2022,09
Works perfectly with my Chromebook,2022,09
For me personally just not a good fit,2022,09
Sensitive mouse. Maybe because it’s new. Works fine,2022,09
"This mouse is very useful and beautiful colors, I thought it wouldn’t fit my Mac but it came with a Mac adapter.  Very convenient! And cute too!",2022,09
"This mouse worked great for 2 months, then the scroll wheel broke.  Don’t waste your money.",2022,09
I’ve had this wireless mouse less than a month and the wheel of the mouse has already broke. Not to happy with this mouse. Won’t buy this again,2022,09
This mouse was great at first but after a week the scrolling part stopped working.,2022,09
Scroll wheel stopped working within 60 days. To long after return time. All other features were good.,2022,09
"The scroll wheel broke after using this for like 3 days, very light use too.",2022,09
Just a garbage. Do NOT waste your money: it is NOT working after couple of weeks.,2022,09
Literally won't charge or turn on. Look somewhere else for a mouse.,2022,09
"I bought this mouse on August 3. It worked well for a while, but today (September 21) the mousewheel spins freely while my screen does not scroll. You get what you pay for, and I guess with this you're only paying for a mouse for a month and a half.",2022,09
Loved it at first but it stopped charging so it doesn’t work anymore,2022,09
I wound up returning because I non longer needed it but it I did try it out and it worked amazingly! I love how quiet and sleek it was and the adapter was perfect for my MacBook.,2022,09
Ease of use and portability,2022,09
The scroll wheel broke after only 1 month. :-(,2022,09
Good mouse,2022,09
Love it,2022,09
"This mouse worked perfectly for about 2 months. Almost on the 2 month mark exactly, the scroll wheel stopped working...it just spins and doesn't move the cursor up and down the page.  I looked to see if I could return, but the window closed a month ago. Don't be tempted by the cheap price. I should have stuck to a name brand!",2022,09
Not for regular or big hands,2022,09
Bought 2 (8/30-7/1) / exchanged 1 immediately due to sent a broken one.Recieved replacement.  Works sometimes.  Won't always work.The other 1.  (Original purchase) scrolly ball won't register any movent 9/18.Good for 2 months if you get one that works properly from the start.,2022,09
It’s a joke. We tried for a long time to get the mouse to even work and it doesn’t. Even after trying the mouse on multiple surfaces and troubleshooting thinking it was our computer. We plugged in a different mouse and it worked fine.Requested a return of the item and I had to pay for the return shipping and print the label. Absolute joke. Don’t waste your time.,2022,09
This wireless mouse works great ! It’s light and connected right to my MacBook Air with no problem.,2022,09
"I ordered my first one in April and had to replace it in June because I dropped it and the mouse wheel stopped working. I got the new one June 17th and today, once again, the mouse wheel stopped working out of nowhere. It barely even lasted three months",2022,09
"My first internal battery mouse.  I liked the ergonomics, but the charging was more frequent than I would have liked.  The mouse was thrown in a landfill, mere months old, because the wheel broke.  R.I.P. mouse..... I'm not really going to miss you.",2022,09
"It’s beautiful, but it literally stopped working after a month…It charges, but when I turn it on it shuts down right away.",2022,09
Barely had it 3 months and the scroll wheel on top stopped working. Now it's pretty much useless.,2022,09
It’s good for a lighting up mouse but isn’t for gaming really,2022,09
"It doesn’t work anymore! After a month when the return is no longer allowed, then it stopped working.",2022,09
The mouse is not effective.  Charged for 24 hours. Still no life or function. Do Not buy. When I noticed that the mouse was not working I charged it for 24 hours. Tried the mouse again and it still did not work but showed red as one of the colors which may be a warning. The seller did not respond or reply to assist me with any troubleshooting. Unsatisfied customer.,2022,09
This product is slim and doesn't fail. Easy click though and lights up. Charge lasts a few day,2022,09
It works just fine just not practical. I always have to recharge the battery. It is a bit of an annoyance.,2022,09
Works good and plug and play.,2022,09
I love this mouse. I've ordered two. The first one lasted me about ~1 year and the second I've received  just died on me about eight months after purchase. The clicker just stopped working on me! :(,2022,09
"I love the color and how slim it is, I use it for work/school.",2022,09
Super light and cute,2022,09
It works well,2022,09
Liked the recharge aspect,2022,09
"I love this mouse, but I have only had for a couple months and it completely stopped working yesterday.",2022,09
Junk,2022,09
"It's a good mouse, worked very well for the time I had it. Driver broke after two months and it doesn't work anymore.",2022,09
Roller ball broke after 2 weeks of use.,2022,09
Great buy…,2022,09
Purchased in June busted in September.  The center wheel broken inside rendering the device worthless.,2022,09
"Terrible product. Only reason I still have it is because Amazon told me just to keep it when I requested a return and refund. Battery doesn’t last at all. Feels terrible in your hand and the buttons and scroll ball are not accurate. Stay away, there are plenty of other cheap rgb mice.",2022,09
Even didn’t lat a month. Broken. Poor “quality”,2022,09
"This mouse worked great, until it didn’t. The scroll wheel no longer works. I use this mouse at my home office, so I haven’t been particularly rough with it where I could understand something breaking after less that 1 year of use.",2022,09
I just love this wireless mouse.  It's not big and bulky.  The clicking is quite and it's really cute looking.,2022,09
It just gets stains easily,2022,09
"I bought this mouse for work and gaming. The first one that arrived broke within the first week of using it. The scroll wheel broke. Returned it and got a replacement. Now, the scroll wheel on the replacement mouse has broken, and the return window has closed. If you're looking for a wireless mouse, do yourself a favor and spend a little extra for quality that won't break after a month or two.",2022,09
"when I first got this item it worked fine, but after a couple of weeks it was not moving the arrow very well.  I dropped it once and it stopped working altogether.",2022,09
Have not had this too long and I’ve charged it and it won’t turn on anymore. I made sure switch is off I even changed chargers it stopped working.,2022,09
Stopped working after a month. Will no longer click down unless heavy force. Very bad product,2022,09
"It's a great mouse, perfect and just what I was looking for. It's really quiet which I appreciate because louds clicks do get annoying after some time but not with this mouse. The lights are cool too! Really slim, so it's easy to pack in my work bag, and it feels great while using it.",2022,09
fits well to contour of hand.  withstands multiple drops to the floor.  battery lasts quite a while after charging.  color changing is pretty.,2022,09
works on phone laptop TV all that pretty cool and lights up so wahoo,2022,09
"I really liked using this mouse. It died a hair quicker than I’d like but I would just use it wired while it charged up. However, a month after using it, the middle scroll circle clicked down and wouldn’t come back up, making it impossible for me to use (as I use that often in playing Sims).  I didn’t expect much as I didn’t pay much, but I was slightly disappointed.",2022,09
Bought this in the beginning of August  and it already doesn't work. Don't waste your money.,2022,09
"I like the fact that it turns off after some time, I like that it works with USB-C and I like that I can use it with my Mac or my PC and I like the charging cable.",2022,09
"I use this mouse with my laptop, it worked pretty good when I first got it, then the wheel quit working. I have no idea why .",2022,09
"I saw all the positive reviews and thought this would be a winner. At first, it was great - loved the colors, it is easy to use, but after a few months the scroll wheel stopped working. I dug a little deeper into the reviews and realized this is a common theme. Now I have to buy another mouse already - and it won't be another one of these!",2022,09
It worked less than a month before it stopped charging and became useless. I purchased a second one and will see how long it lasts.,2022,09
"Worked great for about 9 months. Stays charged for a long time, and like being able to use the C port in my laptop. However now the scroll button moves erratic. Scrolling down the page and the page jumps up., go up and it jumps down.",2022,09
"I love this mouse! Easy to set up, easy to use. It seems to go forever on one charge. And the ever changing light color is really cool.",2022,09
"Sleek and nice, love the colors! Great buy!",2022,09
So cute and charge lasts forever,2022,09
What I REALLY liked was the USB to type C adapter which allowed me to plug USB memory sticks into my smart phone.,2022,09
Second one. Same issue.  The mouse wheel just stops working.  Do not order this product learn from my mistakes.,2022,09
Piece of junk. Already broken. Irritated,2022,09
Love this little mouse for work. The clicking is soft and quiet so it's not annoying when I'm clicking on my computer all day. The color is pretty too and I love the lights.,2022,09
Battery life sucks,2022,09
The roller on top of the mouse quits working or falls down in the mouse.The colors and lights are fun but the mouse itself is defective. I have had 2 at this point and will not buy another.,2022,09
"I was so excited when I got my mouse in to go with my laptop and it didn’t even work. I had it charge over night while it was off, and still wouldn’t connect.",2022,09
"the mouse was great, it worked very good at first but one day it suddenly stopped charging so I haven’t used it in a while.",2022,09
I absolutely love this mouse!  Great color!  Matches my laptop perfectly!  I love the color changing mode!  So fun!,2022,09
"Sleek look and Battery lasts extremely long, I’ve only had to charge it once since getting it. Highly recommend!",2022,09
" Feels great, wide and comfortable.  Lights up when you move around.  Likes so much I Bought a second one too.",2022,09
"Do not recommend, I bought it two months ago and the roller part already broke and it is now useless",2022,09
"I got this mouse to use with my laptop, and it's great. Glides easily, holds a charge for quite a while, and enters sleep mode when not in use. To wake the mouse up, you just right or left click. The changing lights are a great and fun touch",2022,09
Everything,2022,09
Lights are multicolored and are nice. Goes to sleep on its own and is great. Smooth and works fine. Until it breaks. Had it 4 months and 2 days and suddenly while scrolling the wheel broke,2022,09
This is the worst mouse ever it’s hard to glide and it goes dead very fast. Wish I could return it!,2022,09
Worthless to spend 20 min trouble shooting every time i need to use it.,2022,09
"The center scroll wheel lasted less than a week. The mouse itself still works, but it is aggravating that every time you use muscle memory to scroll with a wheel that doesn't work. Decent battery life. Bought a new, different brand mouse to replace it. The mouse also doesn't have much of an arch to it, so its not very ergonomic. Its better than a laptop track-pad though.",2022,09
I love this mouse. I love how quite it is when I use it. Love the sleep feature on it as well. I have nothing bad to say about it. I use it for my online schooling.,2022,09
gets insensitive very quickly and it's so hard to use; light and small and not ergonomic at all; dont recommend buying,2022,09
"Works great, love the quiet clicks, perfect for school without being the annoying one when everything is silent",2022,09
love it,2022,09
"My husband bought 3 of these in different colors for our children for school last month, yesterday was the first day for our 2 youngest. The 1 mouse did great no problem, the second was dead since our daughter likes colors. So we placed it on the charger last night and it's still charging. I unplugged the mouse to see if it had any any charge.....No charge at all. So now I have to explain to my 10 yr old that the company gave her a broken mouse and try to find a way to to get it work with her device while always charging. Should of just went to Target.",2022,09
"The scroller broke within a week, and the material looked greasy and worn after about a week of very limited use.",2022,09
HP laptop compat,2022,09
"I bought this for when I started working from home, after about 2 or 3 months the middle part no longer would scroll the page which is the reason I bought it in the first place. Very disappointing since that’s the reason I bought it in the first place.",2022,09
"I have to charge this mouse way more than I expected especially since I use it for work. Won't buy this again, otherwise seems to work fine besides sometimes jumping from where I have the pointer on the screen to a whole other area. Casual usage this may be fine for you",2022,09
This was the worst mouse I've bought it goes dead very fast and then you have to charge it all night for it to die fast again. I would NOT recommend this mouse.,2022,09
good,2022,09
or should i say WORKED well. it stopped working after like 2 weeks💀,2022,09
Works as described.,2022,09
I used it for about a month and then the sensor broke and the entire thing is useless now,2022,09
"My wrist no longer hurts after being on my computer. Sexy running lights let me see where it is on my desk. I love the pink color, now no one can take it when there batteries are dead and claim your mouse needs batteries. Gotta love family ingenuity.",2022,09
Bought in February and it worked great until 3rd or 4th charge. Now it’s not connecting to my computer any longer.,2022,09
I liked the fact that it uses no battery.  But the charge does not last too long.,2022,09
"Works great.  It’s a little too small and would stress my hand if I used it all day, everyday, but I don’t. So I’m keeping it and am content.  To be more specific, the buttons are not directly below my fingertips (which would be solved by a longer mouse OR an ergonomic one that has a little more height to it.). I’m an averaged sized male, and to my knowledge my hand is typical of that size of person haha.  Hope this helps.",2022,09
"Don't waste your money. It worked well for a few weeks (long enough to miss the return window), but then got jumpy/erratic and wouldn't hold a charge unless plugged in.",2022,09
"It was cheap and the lights are fun but it was cheap and doesn’t work great. Squeaky wheel as you’re scrolling, sometimes it doesn’t track well so that’s annoying. But it gets the job done if your patient. Select a different one.",2022,09
"Product worked well until it didn’t. After 5 months, won’t charge or power on.",2022,09
I guess you get what you paid for. The mouse will not stay charged and will not connect with my iPad. Super disappointed.,2022,09
"I bought this in August and finally managed to get it to work. After just a few minutes of using it, the the roller to scroll stopped working. You can feel when the spring gave way while I was using.  Not sure if it can be fixed",2022,09
"While it's a nice mouse, fits well, it's junk, it died in less than a month, I purchased two so called upgraded updated...don't waste the money...it's junk.",2022,09
Yeah..no. The roller fell inside. I had barely used it,2022,09
I like idea of not needing batteries but needs approvements.,2022,09
"love this mousepad, the clicking is silent and it looks pretty, but the thing dies so FAST!! I work 40 hour week from home and i have to charge the mouse like every day",2022,09
I bought this for my work laptop and just love it. Easy to use and love that it is rechargeable. Fantastic design so it’s not hard on your hands and connects easily with no issues.,2022,09
"When I first received this, I charged it as recommended and it lit up so seemed to work as expected. After charged, I put the toggle in my USB port and nothing happened. It didn’t download anything. It didn’t pair with my laptop. I let it sit then tried again. Nothing. It won’t charge. It won’t light up. Nothing. I never even used it and it stopped working. Very disappointed and a total waste of money.",2022,09
Ergonomic. I would also like to have a full size for desktop use. Multi-color LED adds a nice decorative touch. Mouse wakes up from sleep mode with first click.,2022,09
This is a great mouse. If only my cat would stop breaking them.,2022,09
Quality and matches the description. I like it.,2022,09
scroll wheel failed on both purchases. Seller would not respond to complaint,2022,08
Worth it,2022,01
"This mouse was a back-to school gift for my 8th grade son. It charged fine the first time. Worked ok.  Never charged again and stopped working. School has only been in for one week and he already needs a new mouse ☹️ I can't give it more that one star, if it doesn't work. 🙄",2022,08
"I bought the mouse and used for 1 day, then it kept freezing up. Had to go back to my old mouse",2022,08
"My mouse, no matter how charged it is, loves to just randomly jump to the side of my screen. It's been like this since I first plugged it in... besides that, it's pretty, and I like how the lights combined. It's also really helped me with my carpal tunnel issues.",2022,08
"I ordered this product but the cursor kept jumping around the screen, even when it was fully charged. I figured I just got a bad apple so I made an exchange for a new one. The new mouse came scratched (not a big deal) and the scroll wheel wasn't as smooth (annoying but its fine) but this one's cursor is jumping around the screen too! I would have otherwise liked the mouse. It charges up quickly and I appreciate the sleep mode so that that battery life lasts longer.",2022,08
"Was good while it worked.  Used for basic office work, nothing heavy.  Scroll 'button' broke despite almost never using that function.",2022,08
"I bought this mouse on the 6th of August and it broke on the 31st of the same month. Basically, it lasted me for less than a month. the lights stopped working properly and then the middle part to scroll stopped working, it broke. I do not recommend at all",2022,08
Broke did not work,2022,08
"Used like 10 times before it died. Don't understand the reviews. Horrible product, save your money",2022,08
Does what its meant for,2022,08
"This mouse worked for a while but then broke. The led looked fake and crappy. I wouldn’t buy this if I were u. But if u are in a budget, it would do the job. Just be very careful with it.",2022,08
"Product will not charge (tried multiple outlets/boxes/ cords), product turns on for 2 seconds, has a red light,  then shuts off. Junk.",2022,08
It’s no longer working.,2022,08
I bought this about 6 months ago and use it only for work and the scroll wheel broke and the mouse is now glitching. I’m very disappointed in this purchase quality.,2022,08
"I used this mouse for work as I am a hybrid worker and do most work in the field or different workspaces. When the mouse leaves my home office to go with me, it has its own individual protective/padded case in my work bag.  Worked great until it just stopped working, which is very disappointing after almost 4 months.The mouse still lights up, looks like it works, took a charge from the charger, but will not move on the screen in my work computer (Thinkpad) or personal computer (MacBook). That said, either the mouse internally stopped working in some aspect or the USB dongle is defective per my IT consultant. I tried all possible USB ports, even those on my Apple Magic keyboard and still does not move on the screen. I also tried every idea I could find to reset/repair the issue in line to no avail.It is disappointing and a huge inconvenience this happened. You would expect a product to last more than 4 months. For my coworkers that asked about my mouse as they thought it was cool, they will now be told it died only after a short period of time and cautioned if they decide to buy one.I have yet to hear back from their customer service. And not sure I ever will. Maybe it is true after all, you get what you pay for. Now I need to buy another new mouse, which was something I hoped to not have to worry about for a long time.Please keep in mind, I do not leave this review to bash the company. This review is to let people know my experience with the mouse. Like I said, it worked great until it just stopped working (still lights up, just will not move on my screen) for no apparent reason as it work the night before (8/30/22).Buyer beware.",2022,08
I haven’t used the “sleep mode “ and don’t do gaming,2022,08
Real light weight. Easy to use. Connects quickly,2022,08
I love that the color changes. I haven’t had any problems with it,2022,08
Love the size of it,2022,08
I have bought several of these since this first one.  They work amazing.I have had no issues and I recommend this seller and mouse brand alot.The price is so good!,2022,08
"A few days after the return window expired, the scrolling wheel stopped working.",2022,08
"I like this item a lot. Very fairly priced and the low profile makes it easy on my hand. I don't have the largest hands, but not very small either and a mouse with a high hump is very uncomfortable. This solves that problem nicely. I could do without the sleep mode; I am still getting used to waking it up, and i understand the value of sleep mode so I deal with it. Never having to deal with batteries is also a bonus. Charging it overnight is ideal but I have already forgotten a couple of nights and it's fine. If necessary, you can plug it in and use it while it charges.",2022,08
This product is a piece of junk. It does not work.,2022,08
"Had this mouse for about a month, And the center wheel broke as I was scrolling. Used daily for work.",2022,08
It used to be good until this morning that I couldn’t use the roller since it’s broken. It broke on its own because it’s bad quality,2022,08
White button spin wheel broke 2 months later too late to return!!!,2022,08
It was nice and sleek. It felt very cheaply made though. And it died within 2 weeks of having it. Wouldn't turn on even charged it. Would not recommend buying it.,2022,08
"Mouse works great,  better than expected.",2022,07
I was concerned that this would be difficult to setup. But I was shocked on how easy it was to connect.,2022,08
"I loved this mouse so much that I bought one for my daughter and my mom. I’ve only had this for less than 2 months and it just stopped working. Tried charging it in multiple outlets, switched the usb around and nothing. It just flashes red when I plug the charger in and goes off. So very disappointed because I’ll now have to buy another and can’t return this one.",2022,08
"This is a cheap product, don't buy it",2022,08
"I bought this mouse to replace one that had the mousewheel break.  To be honest, I loved this mouse  at first - the lights, the feel, everything.  However, I was not a fan of the extra added adapter to make it USB-C compatible.  Here I am 2 months after I bought it and the mousewheel no longer functions on this mouse as well.  For some reason the companies that make these portable mouse (mice?) cannot make one that has a sturdy mouse wheel.  Oddly enough, the one thing I didn't like about the mouse originally, became my favorite thing now that it is broken - the adapter to allow me to run regular USB on a USB-C port.",2022,08
Within a week of my son using it the scroll button broke. Somehow it’s outside the return window so now we are stuck with it.,2022,08
"I ordered 2 - the track ball broken in the silver one within 60 days, the right click broke on the rose gold one within 90 days. I only use them for light use - no gaming and they are not sturdy at all. They were both difficult to charge",2022,08
Skips around and freezes when clicking on things. Save your money!,2022,08
I’ve used it only for 6-7 times from Jan to July. Now it won’t on. Don’t buy,2022,08
This product is very cheaply made. I purchased this mouse because my daughter liked the lighting on the side of the mouse.  However the wheel that controls how you scroll up and down on a web page easily  breaks off and you have to return it or buy another one.  Buyer beware take it from a father who has went through 3 of them.,2022,08
"I had to buy two different mice within 4 months. The scroll button stopped working on both devices. Other than that, okay product. LED light function is cool, sleek style and easily rechargeable.",2022,08
"Quiet, fast, works super well! I don’t game but I use it for work and it’s perfect",2022,08
I use this mouse for work. It didn’t require any weird setup like downloading software. It’s super comfy and has a sleep mode that activates after about 15 minutes. A click of the button wakes it up and it’s ready to go. I don’t regularly use the light up mode but it is a cool feature that is fun to show off. I have carpal tunnel and it’s so much better on my wrist than a standard wired computer mouse. Most definitely worth the purchase!,2022,08
The scroll wheels does not work on this mouse,2022,08
The mouse itself is great - works well. however the roller ball on the top of the mouse broke and no longer works. It has only been 6 weeks since purchase.I do like that the lights have an on/off function so you don't need to have it lit all the time which makes it more appropriate when in a work environment.,2022,08
I use this in class and at home and there is not any noise when you are clicking the buttons. Which is nice when we are quietly working on things. I would highly recommend! The color changing is also great!,2022,08
I guess almost a year for under $10 is good enough.  Especially if you want one that recharges because you don't like fooling around with AA batteries. Battery life was good. I could use it all day with no problems.,2022,08
"About 7 weeks, after return window closed, quit working completely. I should have returned sooner as the charge lasts only about one full work day. Spent a lot of time fooling around with a mouse, a tool that should be something you don’t have to think about or make plans to be available for use. Going back to tried and true battery wireless which lasts about a year and no hassle.",2022,08
Good,2022,08
It was most important to me to have a quiet scrolling mouse for my laptop. This mouse has quiet/silent scrolling and silent clicking. Very impressed! The mouse is more of a flat design. The lights around it are pretty neat. There is an on/off switch on the bottom of the mouse that includes an option for the lights as well. Nice mouse for a great price.,2022,08
It was fine until it just stopped working 3 months in. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get a well known brand like Logitech.,2022,08
"I bought five of them this year and three already broke after a few months of light use. Two had the plastic wheel axle broken, the another one just stopped charging and not recognized by Windows anymore. In addition, the USB dongle cover separated and got stuck in the laptop USB port. This mouse is flimsy and does not last. Not very ergonomical as well. Cool lights is the only positive thing to say about this mouse, but it eats battery. Avoid.",2022,08
"I Purchased this for my office work and it broke down after 2weeks, the scroll wheel stopped functioning. Be aware of this and look for something else with better quality.Thanks",2022,08
Do not recommend! Just purchased in June and it's already broken in August.,2022,08
"I have logitech keyboard that I use with no problem with my other mouse, but when i plug this mouse in, the keyboard stops working. The dongle is also hard to remove from the back of the mouse. I had to get something small to pry it out. I little space for your finger to grab it more easily would have been nice.",2022,08
Don't buy...Scroll not working,2022,08
Love it...good price and product.,2022,07
"It’s rechargeable, and the battery lasts quite some time, of course I always turn it off once I’m done using it. But no more batteries. Comes with the charger as well. What more could you ask for!",2022,08
This mouse lasted 31 days just passed the returnable date.Just quite working no matter how many hours I let it recharge.,2022,08
Mouse will not work. I have only had it for about 45 days and the mouse just stopped working. Will not charge either.,2022,08
"I feel like I won this out of a cheap Gumball machine.  Plastic, doesn’t feel like it’s going to last long.",2022,08
"I ordered my first mouse, it broke in two weeks. Returned & reordered- this one broke just a few days after the return window closed. Don’t waste your money.",2022,08
So I loved this and I use a computer daily so you could say it is only intended for rare usage. It broke within the month. I was sad. Specifically the scrolling button.,2022,08
"LED Wireless Mouse, Rechargeable Slim Silent Mouse is easy to use, lightweight, and easy to recharge. The charge last a long time.",2022,08
"I was super excited to use this mouse for my MacBook, but it won't even charge. I would return, but do not have the packaging anymore. DO NOT BUY.",2022,08
"It does not move correctly. When you move the mouse the cursor doesn’t move same thing when you click on something, you have to click a million times before it opens up what your doing or closes what your doing.",2022,08
Ease of installing and very super cool looking at my laptop!,2022,08
I have been using this for less than a month and it doesn’t work. It doesn’t hold a charge.,2022,08
"This mouse has The Quietest click of any mouse I've ever owned. And it puts itself to sleep if I don't move it for a while. It's magical. I wasn't sure about the color changing light, but it's not overpowering or distracting. I've had a very long line of previous wireless mice, but I think this is my favorite. Very pleased with this purchase.",2022,08
Broke within two hours of using it you really gotta watch the Amazon return policy on electronics I have a tendency to buy it and I leave it sitting in the box for way too long.  Bad me because this is the second or third time I’ve gotten burned on crap like this.,2022,08
"Love this mouse! I got it to replace my Logitech mouse because it was glitching. You can’t beat the price for this one, it’s light weight, and the colors are nice!",2022,08
" The ergonomic feel of the mouse is great and the battery life is amazing. It is lightweight and feels cheap. White matches my setup but it’s translucent and takes way from the aesthetic. It is connected less than a ft away and it still loses connectivity which causes it to lag. It makes it completely useless to me. I don’t recommend you buy it, at least not the white one and be aware of the lagging.",2022,08
"Great product, very competitive price.",2022,08
I purchased for my kids to use while doing online class work. It was easy to set up and seems to work well. I was hoping for something that felt more sturdy. It feels very cheap. The kids love the changing lights while they use the mouse. My only complaint is that if they don’t remember to turn off the noise after use then it dies and has to be recharged before if can be used again,2022,08
"Loved this mouse but it breaks super easily. I liked it and figured I'd give it another chance so I bought a second one and it broke after 3 months. It's soft to the touch, and very quiet which I liked. Unfortunately, both times the scroll button stopped working (feels like it detaches). You get what you pay for.",2022,08
I really like this. This is a replacement for a broken battery operated one I used to have. I love that this can charge from a USB port and I'm not having to rely on batteries or worry that they might run out at an inconvenient time. It's got cool lights around the side and it works well on a lot of surfaces. I use my laptop in a recliner chair and this works running on the edge of the chair just fine. I've also used it on wooden table top and vinyl countertop surfaces with good results. It does take just a second when the laptop boots up to locate but that's minimal. The USB wireless component is small and fits really inconspicuously into an unused port on my laptop without being in the way at all. All in all I've been very happy with the quality and efficiency. This was a great purchase.,2022,08
I have never used it because everything is in Chinese even the machine it self .,2022,08
I like that you change button on the back so it stays red and that the blue light stops showing once its done charging. The only thing is I wish it would show you how much battery it has left.,2022,08
Good for the price. It also doesn't make the typical mouse clicking sound. You can barely hear it.,2022,08
"I bought one to try for myself at home, and loved it so much I ordered two more to use at work. This is the best wireless mouse I've ever had. Great value, too!",2022,08
Precise! LED optional  ...  lightweight ~ mouse has a slot for Bluetooth and is rechargeable! No more batteries!Stellar with the 3M precision mouse pad,2022,08
"I didn't realize that it was rechargeable vs a battery.  However, it gets the job done and it comfortable to use.",2022,08
It looks great and feels good in the hand but the scroller broke after a couple months.,2022,08
I received this product in the mail and when first handled it felt very cheap.. I proceeded to use it on my laptop and the mouse wheel wasn’t working at all,2022,08
"I was not fond of this mouse - the ergonomics too flat or charge life. Now after 5 months of average to minimum use it will not charge. My system gives an error message of ""malfunctioning device"". I tried a different USB cord with the same response.I DONOT RECOMMEND THIS MOUSE!",2022,08
"Exactly what I was looking for, but get a longer micro-USB to USB-A charging cable. The one it comes with is only about 3 inches long—just long enough to charge off your laptop.",2022,08
Appearance & size with built in charging.,2022,08
"Loved this mouse. Worked great. After having it for 4 months, the scrolling piece in the middle broke. I was not rough with it. I did not drop it. Just stopped working out of nowhere.",2022,08
I loved this product when I first received it. It lit up and lightweight and just pretty. But that was very short lived. It stopped working after just 2 weeks of using it. Good thing it was on the cheaper side. Maybe it was a disposable mouse that only was supposed to work for a short period?,2022,08
"Don't buy it! For one is very inconvenient rechargeable - you never know when mouse is out of juice. Two, mouse is dead after just 2 MONTHS",2022,08
I've had the product for less than two months and it no longer works. Really disappointed.,2022,08
Super sleek and super quiet. I love this mouse!!,2022,08
"I bought this a first time and after a few months it died completely, even after being charged it will not respond when turned back on. I thought it might just be a one time defect and bought another. This time it died completely after 1 month. Nice while it worked, but will not be buying a 3rd time.",2022,08
More technical trash,2022,08
"It’s lightweight, colorful, and it charges using a usb. No more changing out batteries. I love that!! It does go into sleep mode when I haven’t used it for a period of time (meaning it’s just idling). I haven’t found out how to wake it up so I just flip it over switch it off and on back again to resume using it.",2022,08
Worked great while it lasted. The roller wheel stopped working first week back to school after summer break.  The roller wheel just spins in place. One of the “arms” snapped. It has been kept in a protective pouch.,2022,08
"Love the LED lights, connects quickly. The rechargeable feature is great until you forget to recharge",2022,08
"I have small hands and my old mouse was too big for my hand.  This mouse is lower, so I don't need to move my wrist and fingers higher to click.  It's not a cure, but it's great that it fits my hand much better and doesn't put as much strain on my hand.",2022,08
nice comfy and also very smooth,2022,08
Should have had a usb-c charging port on it instead of micro USB. Otherwise it's great for my daughter's 5 year old hands.,2022,08
"Scrolling roller ball doesn’t function, just freely spins without engaging.",2022,08
"I bought this mouse and the thing barely moves across the screen not traction! It's very cheaply made, would not recommend at all! I needed one fast cause my old one is going I've had for years. This mouse will not last four years!",2022,08
"after 2 months of somewhat daily usage just for checking emails occasionally or something fast, the middle wheel stopped working making it a pain in my ass to use. I would recommend staying clear since it only has a 30-day warranty.",2022,08
"The mouse functions well. However, after a few days, I noticed that the multicolor lights no longer changes. I hope to find some way to fix it.",2022,08
"Bought this in June ... IT's DEAD. Plus when in wireless mode, frequently ... multiple times per day, the mouse drops connection. Cheap product, would rather have a working product!",2022,08
"The charge for this mouse only lasts a day. Very annoying. And it isnt the most quiet either. Feels cheap, performs meh. Dont waste your money.",2022,08
Not functional for gaming if the charge doesn't last.,2022,08
It works great & is fast.,2022,08
I love how cute this mouse is.  I use it for work.  It goes into sleep mode pretty quickly but one click and you're back up and running! I charge it once a week.,2022,08
"When my 5 year old wired mouse finally died I started looking at replacement options.  I have never liked wireless mice due to the constant need for batteries and finding some in the office or while traveling is always a huge pain.  Finding out that there are rechargeable options out there was a game changer.  So far after about two weeks of use I love feel of the mouse, the pointer speed which is adjustable, and well the fact that I just plug it in to charge.  While the receiver is USB A and comes with an adapter for USB C, the charging port on the mouse is micro USB, the charging cable that comes with is USB A to micro USB (~6 inches) incase you want a longer one like I did.  One thing though, I do have small hands so the size is perfect, someone with small to medium sized hands will like the feel and size of the mouse, if you have large hands it may feel to small.All in all I liked it so much I ordered a 2nd one for my work laptop bag to replace the wired mouse that I travel with.",2022,08
"Not worth it, I had this for only 3 months and it broke. It just stopped working, I could not scroll at all no matter what I did. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Then after contacting Amazon I was charged a 2 dollar restocking fee, for them and had to send it back on my own.",2022,08
The different colored lights stopped working after a week and it only had a red light. After two months the mouse stopped working entirely. Sucks because it's too late to return it,2022,08
great product,2022,08
"I really like this mouse, it is low profile and fits my small hands perfectly. The only thing I really don't like about it is all the flashes of different color lights on it. I need to check to see if there is a way to disable the light feature. Otherwise, a very nice mouse !!!",2022,08
Scroll button stopped working within 2 weeks,2022,08
Won't hold a charge,2022,08
"This mouse is wonderful to use for precise things such as line drawing and making flow charts.  It is super comfortable to use.  Unfortunately,  I bought this at the beginning of the year and now it will not charge, so I basically now have a corded mouse which is what I needed to avoid.  So, until I find a highly rated cordless, or a battery operated one, I will be tied to the computer (literally)",2022,08
I started using this product exactly a month ago. It will not work now unless it’s plugged into the charger. Which defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse. Can’t recommend.,2022,08
I bought this for work..I had it maybe couple of weeks and it stopped working..couldn't get it to hold a charge..,2022,08
"The mouse worked well for 1 day, but nowhere cursor is non-responsive. I checked to make sure it was fully charged, did some troubleshooting, and moved the USB to multiple ports on the laptop. Nothing worked. I'm guessing I just received a dud? Or maybe the mouse just isn't compatible with my laptop? I've used multiple wireless mouses with this laptop; this is the first time I've ever had an issue. Make sure you try the mouse out right away (after charging) upon receiving it (incase it doesn't work and needs to be returned).",2022,08
Stopped working in about an hour.,2022,08
The mouse worked for a couple weeks but now the scroller just spins freeling and won’t scroll one through pages. Really disappointed because the mouse as a whole worked pretty well for the last couple weeks. Hopefully just a defective model. Will be returning the item and seeking a replacement,2022,08
" Light pink, quiet when I click. Smooth across my mouse pad and does not get stuck. LED lights change often. All as advertised from my concern.",2022,08
Does all the things a mouse should.  The sleep mode is a nice touch.,2022,08
Worked great...for a month then the center button stopped working.,2022,08
It was working well until it just stopped working after 3 months. It won’t charge and turn on anymore pretty much useless now. Not well made and it’s a waste of money if you’re looking for a reliable and and an item that will last long do not get this one coz you will be disappointed. I tried my luck and didn’t listen to the reviews I read now I am so disappointed. Could have spend $10 more to a most reliable and long lasting one.,2022,08
I charged this mouse one time for an hour and it’s been going for a month now on that one charge. The clicks are silent. I love this comfortable mouse!Edit: loved it until the scroll wheel stopped working.,2022,08
Scroll bar broke a month after getting it.,2022,08
"I tried to give this mouse some time. I tried it on different surfaces. In all cases it skipped around and was very hard to work with. Unfortunately,  because of vacation and because I tried to make it work,  I missed the return window…., By one day! That just frustrates me even more.",2022,08
"I purchased this in February 2022, it began tracking poorly in July and stopped scrolling in August.",2022,08
"Was decent first month, very flat so not ergonomic but that's personal taste. Issue is this is already broken. The scroll wheel no longer works.....even for a $10 mouse, that's pretty pathetic since I've had other mouses for years at a time. I had the same issue as other reviews with the cursor randomly jumping too so there might be some design issue with the sensor.",2022,08
"This mouse was purchased for a 10 year old girl.  She loves the colors, the fit, and the fact that it works without making noise.",2022,08
I bought this 5 weeks ago and now the scroll doesn't work.  If you need a mouse choose something other than this.,2022,08
Junk,2022,08
don't spend your money on this crap,2022,08
"I am very happy with this mouse, the colors are interesting and the fact that I don't have to buy batteries is an added plus!!",2022,08
Perfect,2022,08
It says it is supposed to install hardware automatically and should work once completed however that is not the case for mine and it doesn't tell me what should be installed for me to try to find it on my own,2022,08
I hate this product,2022,08
Bought this on Prime day and it does not disappoint!  The silent click and long charge life is great.  Love the sleep mode and the slim feel.  Will be buying another one.,2022,08
"After two days of using , the mouse went dead and would not work again no matter how long I charged it .",2022,08
"I'd gotten a mouse/ mouse pad combo at TJ Maxx, but there was no usb to connect it to my laptop-- so i ordered this online. It was a good price and shipped quickly, and I am so glad I ordered it. It's way cooler than the other one I bought and feels like it's made better. It lights up, there's an on/off and sleep mode to preserve battery. Also works so seamlessly and smooth. Great product, thanks!",2022,08
I don't use for gaming,2022,08
Works great,2021,06
"the mouse itself was fine at first, worked great and i liked the shape and sound. but the wheel started to squeak, and it always scrolled too fast for my liking. and now the mouse won’t work at all, always jumping around the screen, spinning, lagging, or unresponsive. really annoying when i’m trying to play games. it does this when the battery is getting low too. not a fan. it works sometimes flat on my desktop but then it slowly gets worse and worse as the night goes on. and now it won’t even read on my mousepad at all? it HAS to be on the desktop to make it work, even poorly.",2022,08
"I really loved this mouse.  I did not replace it with the same mouse, however because the wheel broke.  I only use this device M-F for work.  I'm not a gamer or anything like that.  I've had wireless mice that do not break for years previously.  Great color, very cool looking.  Will miss using this.  Not sure if there is any warranty",2022,08
"I liked everything about this mouse, was working great the couple of times a week that I used it. Then one day… the scroll wheel stopped working completely. No it’s not dirty, there is no resistance it feels like it is free wheeling in there. No explanation. Past “return period.”",2022,08
Be sure your computer is on in order to see the lights on the white mouse :) was so close to returning it as my other mouse with lights was always on regardless of my computer. But glad I problem solved my own problem!,2022,08
"might work for low use, we shall see and I'll update this review after a week or so of use.Update: received 11Aug  mouse died 22Sep RIP",2022,08
Cute mouse . . . I just love how it lights up with the different colors.,2022,08
It worked for about 3 weeks plus afew days before it stopped working.,2022,08
It had worked very well for me for about 2 years and it’s very aesthetic!,2022,08
"Mouse worked fine for two weeks. Shape took some getting used to since it’s low profile. Charge held up pretty well. BUT the scroll wheel broke after a few weeks of use, so in the trash it goes.",2022,08
"It is quite nice, it has an interesting style and the colored lights give it a special touch, unfortunately in terms of performance is lousy, the sleep mode seems to fail constantly, sometimes it turns off for no reason and stops working for a while (being fully charged) so it must be damaged internally. Very disappointed with this product, no matter how nice it is it is not worth buying if it does not fulfill its main function.",2022,08
The scrolling wheel is already broken and havent even used the mouse for a month.,2022,08
Love how Amazon is fast and product is great,2022,08
It’s honestly awful it won’t charge and I’ve tried four different chargers.,2022,08
Great purchase,2022,08
"Pretty easy to use and set up, comes with a charger. I expected the lights to be a bit more appealing but they’re mainly just solid colors when you have it on the led light mode. Fits snug with my hands and does the job for the most part so complain. Probably wouldn’t use for gaming purposes though.",2022,08
Purchased for daughter and she didn’t like the ergonomics of it. I threw it in my work travel bag and have ended up using it. Works well and battery lasts a while. It’s also a nice conversation piece in meetings ;-),2022,08
The product is good and operates well.,2022,08
"Nice mouse -- if it worked! The first one I purchased worked for about a month. When the scrolling wheel broke, the company replaced it, free of charge. Now, six months later, the second one has quit working; won't hold a charge.",2022,08
I love it,2022,08
"My son wanted this for his Macbook, so I will tell you it needs an adapter. The Macbook doesn’t have a USB port. But after that he is pleased with the performance. He uses it to play games too and says it is responsive.",2022,08
Mouse is easy to use and works well. However the first time I put it in my bag the color chipped off the mouse. Now I have a teal mouse with white specks. Super disappointed,2022,08
This is the cheapest thing I have ever seen the quality is horrible! Holding it in my hand feels like it weighs nothing it is extremely cheap. The lights are neat tho. They should be ashamed selling this for anymore then 2$,2022,08
Literally will not charge or hold a charge,2022,08
This mouse only worked for one charging. When I charged it the  second time everything works backwards. want to go left it goes right your want it to go up it goes down. I DON'T  recommend this item they say you can't return it.,2022,08
Charge didn’t last all day and then delay kept getting longer. I simply don’t have time to hook it to a cord and there’s no battery charge option.,2022,08
Stops working a week after buying do not waste your money. Mine won’t stay connected to my computer constantly having to reconnect it,2022,08
It broke literally less than a month and ive never even dropped it. Super disappointed and waste of money.,2022,08
"I used this very infrequently, and the spinning wheel broke within a couple months.",2022,08
Great product but a little too flat for me.,2022,08
Love it will have to but another one....,2022,08
"works well, silent, durable (so far so good)",2022,08
My son was using it for his laptop for school and it stopped working didn’t want to work nomore .,2022,08
"I'm not too happy with this LED MOUSE, when it goes on sleep mode, I have to literally turn it off and turn it back on to boot up again. I'm thinking of returning it and get a full refund on this product.",2022,08
Mouse works well and holds a charge for several 8 hour work days. Only drawback for me is that the scroll wheel is loud.,2022,08
"After exactly two months the roller wheel in the middle broke. I tried prying it apart and it is not fixable and is a pain to always have to use the scrollbar with the mouse. The lights are kind of distracting & not necessary. However, it does stay charged for a week or more at a time. I'm cheap and bought this for data work. It works (other than the middle wheel now) and is okay for the price or if you don't have high expectations.",2022,08
Easy to use and lite weight. I will purchase another one soon,2022,08
"if you want an led mouse for aesthetics, dont buy this brand.this has a flashing red led that is seperate from the rgb leds, & it stays on even when the led switch is not on.",2022,08
"I tried charging the mouse but it didn’t want to charge, tried multiple cables and nothing, light kept switching and when i plugged the adapter in it didn’t pop up or recognized it.",2022,08
Easy and fits my hand. I have some numbness in my right hand.,2022,08
The scroll wheel stopped working 38 days after I bought it.  I used it less than 20 times,2022,08
"DON'T BUY IT. IT CAN'T HOLD A CHARGE, IT MOVES ON IT'S OWN, AND WAS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR HOW CRAPPY IT WAS.",2022,08
Red lights stays on and nothing happens.  Really like this mouse until this happened.,2022,08
Slim in the hand and works great!,2022,08
Really liked how light weight the product is however it stopped working after 2 months. The battery life was great in the beginning but now it doesn't operate even after charging it.,2022,08
"Don’t buy, died as soon as the return period is over! Can’t get a refund for it",2022,08
"I have been using this mouse for 9 days and the scroll wheel broke completely when I pressed it. It was alright in its short 9 days, comfortable. But the scroll wheel clicked very loudly which I didn’t like.Don’t waste your money.",2022,08
"Cute mouse! I love the blue on it, and the lights are a cute touch. Its very lightweight! Very quiet! no clicking sounds from the mouse which is great.",2022,08
"This mouse is super cute! It is lightweight, and the color matched perfectly to the picture (I got dark gray to match my Macbook Pro). The click is silent, which I love. The LED lights are bright and colorful. There is also a setting where you can just have red lights, but I love the color changing. The only downside is that this mouse does not hold a charge long enough to last my entire workday. I've started switching it off when I am away from my desk, and that help some. Charging is simple, though.",2022,08
"I loved the look and feel of this mouse. However, it stopped working after only a week of using. It won’t charge at all and a coworker said she had the same issue with the same mouse. Don’t waste your money!",2022,08
"I was pleased to see just how well made the mouse was when I received it. I couldn't have asked for more for the money. It's comfortable in my hand. The rubber texture really makes using it a pleasure. The dongle storage on the bottom of the mouse isn't covered, but it's nice and tight, so I'm not worried about losing it. So far so good!",2022,08
It works smoothly and the colors are fun. Keeps charged for a good while.,2022,07
"Do not buy! This mouse stopped working August 1st, yesterday, I thought it was just dead so I made sure to charge it. This morning I go to use the mouse and it still is not working, despite it being fully charged. It just doesn't turn on anymore. I am extremely disappointed because I just bought this mouse on June 29th, meaning that the return window closed on July 29th. This mouse stopped working entirely (doesn't even turn on anymore) two days after the return window closed. Do not buy this product!!! If I could give it less stars I would.",2022,07
Loved by Medical assistants throughout my office.,2022,07
While working on my desk a close by book fell on top of the mouse and now it doesn’t take charge. By the way it was the first day Zi was using it.,2022,07
"if you leave the mouse unactive for a minute or two you have to turn the mouse off and back on or the mouse will lag, skip across the screen as you try to move the mouse around. It is extremely annoying.",2022,07
Wet sleek and love the silent clicks and the lights.very satisfied with it,2022,07
"This came with an adaptor to fit the Apple laptop, but is not made specifically for Apple products. The charge does not last long and needs a special adaptor. I prefer a battery operated mouse as maintaining so many different chargers on my desk is cumbersome.  The three settings for on off are also less than ideal. In summary, while this mouse is aesthetically pretty, it is not functional with the Apple products.",2022,07
Quality was not worth it! Stopped working unexpectedly,2022,07
I love it. Easy to install and use. Mouse is soft and movies easily.,2022,07
From what I'd read this would plug into an android tablet I have so that I could control without using the touch-screen. But the adaptor did not allow this. My mistake probably.,2022,07
The mouse broke a couple days after the return window. Reached out and heard nothing back. Not fun throwing money away like that.,2022,07
Love it,2021,11
It stopped working after three and a half months. The scroll button stopped working.,2022,07
"Update - I lost my favorite mouse today. I bought it on Jun 12, 2022, reviewed it Aug 1, 2022, and it died yesterday, Aug 2, 2022. So the mouse lasted appx 11 weeks. Two and a half months is a pretty disappointing lifespan. The battery died so I plugged it in, as always, yet it doesn't connect anymore. I've tried removing the USB transmitter, rebooting the computer, plunging it in and out, and turning it off and on, but nothing. I even tried 're-charging' it, but nope. It's a lost cause.I bought this mouse to replace the wireless Logitech I was using for my laptop. It died and I decided to try this rechargeable mouse from OKIMO. I never heard of the brand but I'm impressed.This first charge lasted so long that I almost forgot it was rechargeable. I bought it in mid-June (It's Aug 1, 2022 today) and I'm just on my second charge. The first charge lasted over a month.This mouse does shut off after it's idle for a while and I'm sure that is the secret to the long battery life. Just a quick left click and it's back in business almost immediately.I love the slim feel of this mouse. It works beautifully.I thought the changing light would bother me (I'm old - 57) but it doesn't. It's more like a pleasant subdued highlight effect.I'll probably buy another one for my desktop but in another color so I don't get them mixed up.",2022,07
Has not even been two weeks and it stopped working. I have it charging it’ll light up blue then it turns off within A minute,2022,07
"Great for the price, hold charge for a good amount of time",2022,07
This lasts quite a while before requiring plug in!,2022,07
It is exactly as pictured. works well.,2022,07
 Aesthetically this is very enjoyable to use because of the changing colors of the rainbow. I like how it's wireless and it can even work from a small distance away on another table from separate from my computer. It works very well. It has an on and off button for storage.,2022,07
Just love the narrow band of changing colors around the mouse. It's so cheerful.,2022,07
"I love the ease of use with this mouse, the ability to charge it rather than constantly replace batteries, and to shut off or put to sleep the noise. It's durable and perfect for my usage, and I was able to get it in Pink!",2022,07
It works,2022,07
"This thing works well most of the time. If you don’t turn it off and just let it go to sleep mode, it dies fairly quickly but you still get a couple of days of use out of it (if you’re not using it 8 hours a day, at least). If you turn it off every time you’re done though you can get probably a month but at least 2 weeks out of it with moderate use. I originally bought it to use with my iPad, however the case on my iPad wouldn’t really allow the USB-C to plug into the charger port. I wish they made an option to get either a USB or a USB-C plug as you get both with this mouse but you have to plug the USB into the USB-C adapter which makes the USB-C plug significantly thicker than necessary. Now I use it for my MacBook. Just a warning, if you want it to scroll like a regular mouse you have to change it in the setting of the computer (but that’s a MacBook problem not a problem with this mouse, not all of Apple’s setting decisions make sense but that’s nothing new). I do really like that I can chose to just turn on the mouse with a solid red color (which preserves battery) or turn it on to change colors (reduces how much time you get out of the mouse but is a cool feature). My only complaint is that sometimes the mouse isn’t tracking perfectly and the cursor is in a completely different place than I would expect it to be (further behind where I was moving it to rather than the cursor doing its own thing), but that may also be a thing I have to change on the laptop.",2022,07
Does not work,2022,07
It’s very cute looks chic. Now I can find my mouse at night with out a problem.🙂,2022,07
"Does not hold charge, dead after 5 months of use.",2022,07
"I've been using Logitech Marble Mice for years, maybe over a decade.  I just love that you control the cursor with just your fingertips.  But it's weakness is that the Marble Mouse's scrolling function is clumsy and jerky as it lacks a legit scroll wheel.  That is probably the sole reason I bought this LED wireless mouse.The LED mouse seems to function well.  It has a sleep mode that easily wakes up and had a pretty color light around it.  I don't use it for general mousing, but for scrolling.  Once i get the cursor in the right window the mouse can be on the desk, in my lap. wherever.  It makes up for what I don't have with my Marble Mouse.  The price was right and I think if it's what I paid for it it's a good, cheap addition.",2022,07
the mouse can use but the back side of the light  is broke .,2022,07
Great mouse i use it for everything from gaming to normal use I recommend it,2022,07
This mouse is extremely lightweight and easy to use. I love the lights that constantly change while you're using it. The best part for me is the fact that it's rechargeable...just plug it into any USB (I plug it into my laptop at the end of the day) battery usually lasts me a few full days of work. Sleep mode is great and helps prolong battery life.,2022,07
I love it !!!!,2022,07
Works well light weight,2022,07
Been trying this for over a month now and have only used it a handful of times because the charge barely last 3 hours at most even after a full charge. Save your money,2022,07
Easy to setup fit nice on the palm of your hand,2022,07
So far so good.  Looks cool and feels good.  Would buy again,2022,07
"It's good but for gaming, I don’t recommend this slim one. It's ok for normal work.",2022,07
Excellent price an very comfortableThere are great,2022,07
"I bought the white one and at first it was only lighting up red and thought the picture was misleading. I then realized the on/off switch on the bottom actually serves two functions. One click on will turn the mouse on and glowing red. Two clicks on and the rainbow colors appear. I will say the white mouse is almost translucent, the rainbow colors illuminate the whole mouse, not just the sides. It's plug and play, very easy to use and comfortable.",2022,07
"This is probably my second review in life because I hate leaving them. But I'm very disappointed that the scroll wheel stopped working right after a month of use. I don't even use it every day. Hell, I don't even use it every other day, so this definite came as a shock. Of course, the return window is closed, which go figure when you sell a cheap mouse and the seller isn't easily accessible. I'd like to think out of good character and business that I would be able to replace this mouse as I love the color and the lights on it, but what's the point if it no longer serves its purpose ???",2022,07
"Colors are just ok, I have to position the charger a certain way for it to actually charge.",2022,07
This crapped out within three months. Invest in a better quality mouse. So tedious having to replace these cheap electronics so often!,2022,07
Liked it a lot until it stopped working after only using it intermittently for a couple months.  No longer will right click,2022,07
Beats having to contend with the wire of a wired mouse; as well as having to use your finger on the little laptop control surface.,2022,07
Great purchase!!! It’s so cute and easy to handle!!,2022,07
I initially liked this mouse because it’s cute. It’s too flat to be ergonomic but that was okay. Except I’ve used it for less than a month and the scroll wheel has fallen off its track. It also dies very fast and needs to be recharged often. I don’t recommend it for anyone using a mouse regularly.,2022,07
Made to seamlessly fit hands. A pleasure to use.,2022,07
"My mouse never worked. I charged it the first day for the recommended time. When I tried to use it, it powered on briefly and then powered completely off. I thought it must not have charged completely. So I charged it again, and again, and again. Each time, it did the same thing. I just threw it away. Never even got to use it.",2022,07
Does not hold a charge. Have to recharge every three days approximately.,2022,07
its been less than 3 months but the mouse has already popped open and doesn’t work. I just wish it would last longer.,2022,07
this mouse last me like a month or two . im not able to scroll up using this mouse . will not buy again,2022,07
"I purchased this mouse because it was wireless and the white color with LED colors were nice. The mouse holds a charge for quite a while, works great. The colors are ok, nothing to warrant a complaint. It was a bargain and I would buy again.",2022,07
I bought this mouse in late Feb 22 and the scrolling wheel has stopped working in July. The body is made of what look like cheap materials. I bought it but now can’t even find the seller to ask. Would not recommend.,2022,07
"Very comfortable to use,  love it",2022,07
"I ordered this mouse in the light blue color for an eight year old girl. The mouse works well, and she loves the bright and changing colors. Highly recommend!",2022,07
Bought this mouse in March and today it stopped working. It will not charge and is now useless.,2022,07
"Battery life was great, worked great for a while, but it will not charge. First time I went to charge it, I plug it into my laptop and a power brick, it lights up for 3 seconds, then shuts off. Now it won't turn on at all. Sadly, I would love to give this product more stars, but now this is useless and I can't even use it while it's plugged in.",2022,07
"Great to use, quite clicks, and looks very cool!",2022,07
"This mouse is slimmer than others, since I have a small hand, it is very comfortable to use.Great buy !!",2022,07
Super cute! But it is really slow.,2022,07
this is an update to my last review.  It has been 4 months and it stopped working!I bought this because of the price and color.Next time I will go with a more reputable company....,2022,07
The c type adapter doesnt work.,2022,07
"Nothing wrong with this mouse, does the job. I use with new laptop.",2022,07
"Simple book up and very responsive. Sturdy construction, beautiful light display and worth every penny. Just as good, if not better, than the more expensive brands.",2022,07
Worked well for a few months now scroll doesn't work,2022,07
"The mouse is ergonomic, very easy to use. The price is not bad either all in all good purchase.",2022,07
" I LOVE this mouse! It’s super cute and lightweight, I love the led lights option. Paired perfectly with my MacBook",2022,07
"I ordered this in early June and really enjoyed the fun color and sleek design.  However now, in late July, about 1 1/2 months later first the USB transmitter broke off and got stuck in my laptop and then the mouse itself stopped charging and no longer works.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Look elsewhere!",2022,07
It works great.  Like the color.,2022,07
"People are right this is a rip off. Waste of money , it only worked for a week. Wow",2022,07
This mouse absolutely sucks. I've tried charging it and the blue light appears then after 2 minutes it goes out. I plugged it in at 11 a.m. and 3 hours later it's still dead. And they sent it to me again and it keeps happening. It doesn't charge and it doesn't work it's just cheap plastic don't get it.,2022,07
"Battery doesn't last long and sleep mode is annoying so I tossed it. Without warning, it will just quit on you. Going back to battery brand.",2022,07
This mouse is of great quality,2022,07
I use for work it is needing to be charged almost every 3-4 days.,2022,07
"Cheap for a reason, doesnt work after 2 months. I guess that is why the return policy is just 30 days. Do not waste your time on this item. Complete garbage.",2022,07
Purchased May 4th and USB broke apart by July 15th - save your money.,2022,07
i am sick with stage 4 melonoma so i just opened it.  it jiggles.  junk,2022,07
This item came broken. We tried charging it over night but it never worked. Had to return it,2022,07
It never would charge?,2022,07
Right button defective after 1 month usage.,2022,07
Working great. Plugged in or wireless I have no problem so far,2022,07
This mouse is very quiet when you click and is ergonomically comfortable.,2022,07
Works well special features are fun,2022,07
"Bought this mouse, because when my other one died, I remember having to change my battery at least once a month. After getting this, originally charged, and has kept the charge for almost a month now, and just had to recharge for the 1st time. Charged overnight, and working great again. LOVE THIS!!!! small, quiet mouse, easy to hold with a rubberized texture that keeps it from slipping.",2022,07
"If you want to have to charge a mouse more than use it, this product is for you. I had moderate hopes, but this mouse falls short of even those",2022,07
"Yeah, this thing is pretty great honestly. It works really well and is completely silent which I really like at work. I don’t like to be constantly clicking all the time. The rubberized feel is also very satisfying, and I mean very satisfying. Overall, you really can’t go wrong here for the price.",2022,07
"The mouse is cute, has quiet clicks, smooth glide, and is light.  It is also comfortable for your hand.  Like the rechargeable feature, as well",2022,07
I really like the design and feel of this mouse.  I bought 2 in a week!  The lights are cool and I like the sleep feature if it's not used for 10 minutes.  Great price!!,2022,07
Worked fine out of the box until it needed recharging and now won't charge.  It has a blue light on it so I know it's getting power but as soon as I disconnect the cord it's dead.  Worthless.,2022,07
mouse not working properly .,2022,07
"It can also be ""jumpy"" on the pointer. I use it with Linux, so I can't configure it.",2022,07
It’s good size shape mouse. Let’s see how long it last. In my son Gand if it’s not brand name don’t last more then 5 to 10 week.,2022,07
"Waste of money, never charged and never worked. Waited to late to return so it'll go in the trash.",2022,07
The slim design fits well in my small hands,2022,07
"It works well functionality wise for me, but the lights don't work. It just stays red and the light is very blinky/jittery",2022,07
I love using this mouse. It recharges fast and it lasts for days. It's quiet and my wrist didn't hurt after using it for a while.,2022,07
I like this mouse very much.  It moves smoothly and is small so there is no discomfort for my hand.  The only thing I do not like is the on/off switch.  It is very small and hard to make it move.,2022,07
"It is almost perfect escept the assembly gap is big, some dust, dirt & tiny food waste will go in easily",2022,07
It would've been nice if this actually worked.,2022,07
"Very nice sleek design. Was expecting a lot more given the reviews, but mouse stopped working after 2-3 weeks. The USB and USB-c adaptors are very flimsy and prone to bending, so as soon as I go to plug it into my computer it does not connect. Definitely would not recommend unless you are looking for a product to use for about a week or two.",2022,07
Slim design. Comfortable for the wrist.,2022,07
I like that when you don’t use it cuts off for you and it’s long lasting when charged,2022,07
This stopped functioning after one week of use.,2022,07
It broke,2022,07
Had this one for 1 week and it already stopped working. The scroll wheel in the middle doesn't work and half the time the items I am trying to click on I can't because the left click button doesn't work. I have charged it several times from the computer and from a wall adapter and still not any better,2022,07
"Worked for less than a month,  it won't charge. Real piece of junk. Not a great product.",2022,07
WORKS GREAT,2022,07
"Use it with my laptop, works perfectly.",2022,07
Quiet clicker,2022,07
works great,2022,07
"At first, this mouse was the best ever. However, whenever it touches a table, the bottom red light turns on and makes the colors look all messed up. It was still very comfortable, though. However, 2-3 months later, whenever I turned it on, it would start autoclicking, and the only way to stop it is to remove the USB charger. It's great for the first months but then started failing me.",2022,07
"The scroll wheel stopped working after 1 month, very frustrated.",2022,07
I am very disappointed with this item. I had replaced it once and the same thing happened where it doesn't hold a charge after a few months of ownership. I really like this product but the cool rainbow changing lights can only be enjoyed when its charged and working properly.,2022,07
Only lasted a month! I didn’t  even care for a refund I just threw it away.,2022,07
"It’s a beautiful  mouse with the color change but I’m not happy that I’ve only had it a few months and it no longer works at all. I don’t care for the USB adapter charging port because I want to use old fashioned batteries sometimes to see if it would work, but I can’t because there is no battery slot.",2022,07
Very satisfied with this mouse.,2022,07
"I bought this because it looked small and exactly what I was looking for. When I received it, I turned it on and it lit up. I got excited to only put it to charge and it completely stopped lighting up. I tried everything to no avail, it either fried during charging or just quit working. Either way, I returned it and got my money back.",2022,07
"First one received only lasted one week, but the return process was quick. I do really like the second one mainly because of the lights...I know, shallow right?",2022,07
"Smooth mouse ,moves nice , great fit . Luv the lights .nice bonus .",2022,07
"Absolutely love it! So slick, slim and smooth!",2022,07
Like the feel and options in this mouse. Happy with purchase,2022,07
Works great for home office and gaming,2022,07
"Just hit, but it is cheaply made. Should hv purchased from best buy vs this one.",2022,07
"The wheel/button broke as it was simply built with a thin plastic rod.  Sent it back, hard pass.",2022,07
Leave it for a few minutes and come back it has to be turned off and back on. Needs FREQUENT recharging.,2022,07
The product seemed good and I liked it until I was just using it normally then it just stopped working I tried charging it turning it off and on and reconnecting it but it still didn't work. I would not recommend this to anyone and I've had it only a couple of weeks.,2022,07
"I bought this mouse because it was rechargeable. It worked fine for a few days, and then just quit working. I ended up having to return it.",2022,07
"This is not for an adult hand, this is better suited for a child’s hand. It also does pretty quickly. It’s very uncomfortable to use and totally not worth it. Even at the lightning price I bought it at.",2022,07
"Starting using on April 2, and when I came back to my desk yesterday it had completely stopped working. I can not charge it (i tried on multiple computers) and the computers won’t acknowledge it if it’s not plugged in directly (which defeats the purpose of the wireless chargeable mouse.Don’t buy if you are looking for a long term option.And I can’t find a way to contact the company. The only option Amazon gives me is to leave a review. I can not contact the seller.",2022,07
I got this almost a month ago and only had to charge it once since then.,2022,07
I use it flowering from home in my laptop l,2022,07
"This is a quick, responsive and easy to use mouse.It can be run normally or with it's built in lights. I sleeps after a short period of unuse but wakes with a single click.A micro USB charging cable (included) charges the mouse in no time. Light is on when charging and turns off when done. With the sleep mode, the battery lasts longer than expected.",2022,07
Works well with windows 11,2022,07
Not very comfy and always disconnected,2022,07
Super smooth operation and super quiet. Excellent battery life. I was very pleasantly surprised. Would not hesitate to purchase a second one or even recommend to someone. Great price.,2022,07
So far I’m very pleased with this product. It connected with my laptop automatically with no problems. The slim line design slips into my laptop case outer pocket very nicely and there seems to be no issues with charging it from a computer port.,2022,07
Was very happy with this purchase until the left click button started getting stuck and having to force it to work. I don’t use the mouse aggressively and haven’t dropped or spilled anything on it. Design and looks are nice but not happy with it breaking so fast.,2022,07
Not only is it pretty but it works great.  Very smooth to the touch.  I didn’t realize how bad my OLD mouse was until I got this.  The charge lasts a long time as well.,2022,07
I like that it’s rechargeable. Unfortunately the scroller on top doesn’t work. I used with both my MacBook and Laptop.,2022,07
I bought this mouse for very light useIt work perfect the first week once I Had to recharge it never turn on againBad quality,2022,07
Love it,2022,07
"Return back in 30days, the 31st day it doesn’t work .how did you make it?",2022,07
Good quality for the price very colorful constantly changing colors. Easy to connect to the computer. Great item!!!,2022,07
Best mouse I’ve ever bought.,2022,07
On-off switch too small. I like the way it lights up. I was always leaving the old mouse on.Add a written review,2022,07
I have had this mouse for less than 3 months that and the rolling ball has stopped working. That sucks.,2022,07
"this mouse is completely useless.the instruction manual has so many typos in it. its not even proper english. even the bottom of the mouse says ""for home and OFFLCE"" use. what??? (see picture)the usb receiver is hidden in the bottom of the mouse. IT DOESNT COME OUT. (see picture) it needs to be plugged into the computer for the mouse to work, but it doesnt come out. i tried everything. i tried to pry it out with my fingernail, nope. tried a pen, nope. i even tried to push it to see if it would pop out, nope. and of course the user manual doesnt explain anything.dont waste your money like i did.",2022,07
Just what I wanted  battery life tbd,2022,07
"I purchased this mouse on prime day, received a mouse that does not work.. no matter what I try. About to send back for a refund. Please don't waste your time purchasing this item. I wish I could relate to the good reviews, I am so disappointed.",2022,07
"Recently purchased this mouse. The look of the lights is cool, I'm not a fan of the sleep mode but I did love the smooth feel of movement and the track wheel was perfect. However, after a day and half, went to charge it and it never came back on. I thought it needed to charge longer, but no. Just stopped working.",2022,07
"I bought this last year not wanting to pay for a premium mouse, and after seeing so many comments. Turns out it's a mistake. The mouse stops working after a few months when i work from home. The pointer just doesn't react at all only the scroll works. If it's a functional mouse it's actually quite well made and I like the design overall. My kid loves the color. Sadly I have to put on this review.",2022,07
Great product.  My daughter loves it.,2022,07
I work in a fast paced setting.  Being able to un-dock and move; I needed something small to transport - this fut my need. I actually bought two.  I may buy more for my team.,2022,07
Great little mouse! It does not tell you that it is about to die though and you have to plug it in to charge it (no batteries) which will slow you down if working or gaming with it.,2022,07
"I purchased 2, one for my desktop and one for my laptop. Received them both on June 1, 2022. The scrolling wheel on one stopped working on July 7, 2022 and the scrolling wheel on the other one stopped working on July 16, 2022.",2022,07
"The mouse is so smooth and responsive. When it died, it wouldn’t take a charge so is now useless. About what I expected for being so cheap $. Pretty color though.",2022,07
Dead in 2 weeks,2022,07
"feels nice in the hand.  Lightweight, but not lightly made, if that makes sense.  Smooth flow, nice to have the usb compartment inside of the mouse.  I use it for my latop when I travel",2022,07
"While the shape of this rechargable mouse is nice, the crappy battery refused to be recharged after less than three months. Don't buy this!",2022,07
"I bought this mouse so that I could use it with my MacBook. Unfortunately it barely works, I have tried for a year now to get it to different surfaces and different ways to try and make it function better but it’s extremely slow and very glitchy and ends up slowing you down so much more than just using whatever mouse pad is on the laptop. It’s extremely lightweight and made from cheap plastic, I was expecting that at least it would work but the lag time is so great that you’re better off not using it at all.",2022,07
Skip it,2022,07
I chose this mouse because it lit up like the rest of my accessories. However the lights are so dim they are barely noticeable. It’s extremely light weight however I feel it is going to break easily since the plastic is so thin. So far for gaming I’ve had no issues with performance of the mouse itself.,2022,07
Bought it in March and now the roller thing does NOT work. Mouse was never dropped. I opened and found that the attachment of the roller is broken.It works as intended and I love that it is rechargeable.I'll buy another one. If it lasts long enough then maybe the first one is just a fluke.,2022,07
"The mouse works great - until it goes to sleep! Agggh!!! Then you have to shake, tap hard, (against your palm so you don't smash it to pieces!), or flip the switch back and forth. It's quite irritating. If it was as simple as on and off, it would be perfect.",2022,07
"Well it's a mouse but doesn't recharge. Has a stupid little white old tech mini USB. Looks like it's charging but it's not.This mouse was so thin it hurt to use for long periods, but only lasted till the battery died, has a charger but it won't recharge. Used multiple cables",2022,07
It is sleek I don’t care that it Hass to be charged every night my other mouse rarely has to be charged I went back to that one so I do not care for this mouse,2022,07
This sister last 10 uses,2022,07
SEE TITLE...JUNK..FEELS POOR IN YOUR HAND...IF A NO STAR BUTTON I WOULD RATE IT 0. DISAPOINTED,2022,07
I purchased this wireless mouse the first part of May 2022.  It is now early July 2022 and it doesn't work anymore!!  I have charged it and it still doesn't work.  WASTE OF MONEY!!,2022,07
"I enjoyed the look and watching this mouse light up, but that is essentially it. The battery storage on the mouse is super low, so you'll have to plug it in any way after about a half hour of use, maybe an hour if you turn off the rainbow LED light feature. The mouse's scroll wheel broke on me in a middle of a game, not any aggressive game, mind you, just a house decorating sim and I've hardly used it for the six or so months I've had it.To sum up: For a quick, cheap purchase, it looks great but isn't worth it in the long run, and I regret not buying a different mouse.",2022,07
"The mouse is cool, comfortable to use, but I’m not a fan of the sleep mode. It’s annoying, but I still like the mouse. Love the color shifting feature, too",2022,07
"After charging, it stopped working. So I put it back on the charger thinking it wasn’t fully charged and nope, still didn’t work! This was a waste of money.",2022,07
Once fully discharged I couldn’t get it to work again even after charging for multiple hours multiple times,2022,07
Super easy to use and transport. Works with my PC,2022,07
I love the wireless mouse. It hold charged in a month even though using 8 hours per day. It is quiet and work great. Thanks for good product. =),2022,07
Broke after 3 weeks of having it.,2022,07
"We purchased two of these and the scrollers broke on both of them in less than two months. There was no trauma to them, they're just junk.",2022,07
"It works, lasting charge but it is flimsy. Used for like 2 weeks no problem cool lighting but im not sure how will it will hold up",2022,07
Battery last about 3 hrs,2022,07
"Broke after no more than 10 minutes of use, something on the inside disconnected and the scrawling wheel spins freely…. not only it was a waste of money, I actually needed a compact mouse for my portable office. Forgot all about it in my trip, now it is too late to return it. You get what you pay for.",2022,07
LOVE this remote! The slim design fits perfectly in my hand. LOVE the changing rainbow colors and the ease of using is absolutely AWESOME!!! Would highly recommend this remote to ANYONE with a PC/Mac/laptop,2022,07
It responds very well and is easy to use.,2022,07
"Had this for a few months now. Still works perfectly. Stays charged for at least a week and you can still use it while its plugged in charging. Ive dropped it a few times and the cover has come off but snapped back on easily, no damage. Perfect for use with my laptop. If you dislike touchpads like I do, this is a great solution for a good price",2022,07
"I was really happy to use this mouse. it's light weight and I really liked the color changing light.However, had it a month and the wheel use to scroll up and down stopped working. So, basically it's useless.",2022,07
I liked the size and ease of charging but very dissatisfied with the lack of reliability.  And of course. Both stopped working just past the point I could return.  Waste of money - useless without the scrolling wheel.,2022,07
Yup.,2022,07
"Type C connector was bent, unable to use!  Is there a way to get a replacement Type C connector?",2022,07
"This mouse is very light, almost too light since you don’t place batteries inside. Ultimately that’s why I’m returning bc I need a mouse that I can’t pick up easily. Also the led lights  don’t look like the picture.",2022,07
Perfect budget mouse if your working with a MacBook like I am. Very smooth and responsive but I wouldn’t recommend for gaming because any crazy fast movement can kind of lag. But for my online studies it’s been perfect.very very long battery life I don’t think I’ve charged it since I bought it 🤣🤣,2022,07
Great mouse because you don't have to keep batteries on hand. It is rechargeable,2022,07
I loved this product until it stoped working after a month.,2022,07
Mouse would not charge after initial charge.  Only got one days use out of it,2022,07
I like it. Worth the money.,2022,07
"Good mouse, love the quiet clicks for working while kiddos are sleeping. Great price.",2022,07
This mouse stopped working after less than 6 months. Would not recommend,2022,07
"Easy to charge with USB cable, lasts longer",2022,07
Stops working even when it’s fully charged.,2022,07
It works well and easy to use,2022,07
Cheap quality and it broke quickly. save your money for something more durable,2022,07
"its sleek , the blush is cute color, like the colored lights also. works well",2022,07
Dissatisfied with purchase. Mouse works except for the scrolling wheel.,2022,07
Can’t change the color only stays on red,2022,07
The scroll wheel stopped working after 3 weeks.,2022,07
Would prefer to buy bcz its cheap and nice,2022,07
it works for what I need so no compliants  here.,2022,07
Computer,2022,07
"Spacious, still have room for other items",2022,07
Stopped working after a few months and I haven’t used it that often for it to not work,2022,07
I like everything about this product,2022,07
Have no problems works just fine!!,2022,07
"Easy to use, enjoy how it feels, very smooth, soft click. Holds a charge for a long time. Lights are cool. It definitely made my life easier while working",2022,07
easy to use and charge. works with my chrome book w/o any special effort.  plugged it in it  works,2022,07
I love this mouse. Sleek design and quiet clicks make it perfect! Will probably buy another one!,2022,07
loved it at first sight lol,2022,07
Works great! Charges up after about an hour for a couple days use!! Great mouse!!,2022,07
"Thin design makes it easy to use and stylish. No bother with batteries, just plug in and charge",2022,07
"This mouse works perfectly for what I bought it for. It’s ergonomic, chic, colorful and works a long time before needing to be charged. It came quickly and was packaged nicely. Buy with confidence!",2022,07
Decent mouse… looks and feels cheap and the light show kinda adds to the “cheapness” of the mouse. Cursor tracking is the biggest issue. The cursor doesnt track consistently smooth when moving it around on the screen and the DTS button doesn’t seem to do anything for controlling this.,2022,07
Quiet and smooth,2022,07
" Finally sleep mode works on this upgraded LED mouse, sleep mode is a must for a mouse because not every time you’ll remember to turn it off plus why bother turning it off while your going for a short break or so it does it for you to save battery.Note: sleep mode does work on color mode, the previous mouse wouldn’t sleep on color mode but this upgraded mouse surly does and wish it had Bluetooth it would be the perfect mouse!",2022,07
"ive tried everything under the sun to make it work and alas it will not lol don’t buy it, not worth it",2022,07
"I removed the mouse from it's box, threw the box away and charged the mouse.  I started using it and on the second day, it just stopped working.  Because I couldn't return it in it's original box, I just threw it away.",2022,07
" I bought this mouse as a backup to keep in my laptop bag, and foolishly didn’t try to use it until the return window had already passed.It has never worked. I threw away my money.I’ve tried syncing this mouse to multiple computers and devices, with the same results — nothing. I can’t find any info about the switch on the bottom, or how to troubleshoot, but when I plug the mouse in to charge it, it illuminates blue. When I actually try to use it, it blinks red and shuts off.It has never worked. Please don’t waste your money. Please learn from my mistake.",2022,07
Maintains the charge for a long period. I don't miss batteries. Nice size and easy use.,2022,07
I often try to use this backward Vs forward it feels the same either way lol— other than that it works well,2022,07
I really like how easy it was to setup.,2022,07
I use this for my second computer and it broke tonight.  Maybe used it a total of 20 times and all of a sudden it broke.  Of course it's out of the return window.  Don't waste your money.,2022,07
"The good - has a separate USB dongle that stores away, and charges internally, ie, no need for a battery.The bad - The mouse tracking is very erratic - too fast, too slow, and could not find a setting that suited me. But what renders it unusable for me is the click latency - I have to click multiple times on anything to get it to work, or I end up dragging something I don't mean to. Some people may also find this mouse a bit too small.YMMV - Up to one's taste how they like the changing colors on the mouse light display - either just red, or it switches colors. I wish you could turn it off though, which unfortunately you can't.",2022,07
I like the size and the fact I don't have to change betteries,2022,07
This mouse has been the best one that I have ever used.  I would purchase this again.  The fun part of the multi colors is another reason to purchase it again,2022,07
Stopped working 2nd north of work,2022,07
Fits my hand perfectly.,2022,07
I have a MacBook and it would not connect. I have charged the mouse for hours and still will not connect.,2022,07
Very nice. Responsive,2022,07
This is a nice streamlined mouse. It is responsive and rolls smoothly,2022,07
Functions exactly as described. Love it!,2022,07
I like the size and how easy it is to use,2022,07
Just a great item,2022,07
Works wonderful,2022,07
Good product,2022,07
Love that its rechargable and the led lights.,2022,07
Mouse works good,2022,07
"This mouse doesn't work well at all, I've had it about 2 months and the mouse doesn't respond, it drags and is not worth the money I paid for it...",2022,07
"I bought 4 of this product for myself and my family. All 4 stopped scrolling, just like that. When my first one went bad, I borrowed my daughter's and that stopped scrolling. So did the other 2 and we only had them for a little over a month when they stopped working. There appears to be a major defect in this product.",2022,07
"I love this mouse. The slim designer, color and quick/easy to charge",2022,07
It's very slow at connecting that one clicks on. Sometimes you have to tap a few times to get it to connect.,2022,07
Roller will not work. The mouse won’t scroll. Seems to be very common. It never worked.,2022,07
"Unfortunately I was in a hurry when I bought this and didn’t take the time to read the other reviews. Hopefully, you’re taking the time to read them. I got it and it never even turned on. I made sure I was doing everything right and even got my dad to look too, but it wouldn’t charge. The light would turn on when I plugged it in for a few minutes and then turn off. It looks like other people had this issue but a few weeks into using it, so at least it broke in time for me to return. Still a hassle",2022,06
it's a nice mouse,2022,06
"Lights up for a minute while plugged in to charge and then shuts off, won’t turn on at all and the USB C adapter it comes with doesn’t even fit into a C port / my MacBook A2179",2022,06
"Works like a charm. You can change the mouse speed right from the actual device, love it!",2022,06
Quite and really easy to use.,2022,06
It is a great compact size. Nice features. Feels good in the hand. I like that it is rechargeable.,2022,06
I love it when I first got it. But now it has stopped working.,2022,06
"I got this mouse for my daughter. It worked for the first few days, then quit charging. I’ve tried to charge with various cables and connectors, but no success. Total waste of money, I would not recommend this product.",2022,06
I have this same model in Bluetooth and it works great. Needed it for an old yoga11 win10 laptop - no issues and works great,2022,06
"Sleek, lightweight",2022,06
Nothing,2022,06
Have to bang mouse to get it to wake up.,2022,06
"Works as expected. I like the colors, they puts a little sunshine in my work day.Sleep mode is too quick for me but it wakes up quickly after a good shake.",2022,06
Love the product. Will probably order another color.,2022,06
It works very well with my MacBook,2022,06
Works very well,2022,06
I love that I can charge it and not have to keep going through batteries. Its better than the last mouse I had. Will upgrade my keyboard when it goes out.,2022,06
Was enjoying the use of the mouse until one day the usb stopped being recognized.,2022,06
the type C-receiver doesn't work. DO NOY BUY !,2022,06
"I got the mouse, but the charging cable sent was a type ""C"" charging cable so it wont fit into the mouse to charge.",2022,06
"I bought this mouse so I could have something rather than a trackpad for college. I read the manual and did everything to get this mouse to work. The softwares that are compatible with this mouse are older. I have the macOS 12.4, this mouse is only compatible with the macOS 10.12-10.12!! If you're looking for a mouse and you're in the same situation as me, this one isn't it!",2022,06
"Love this mouse. It works great, has a fun LED light feature, feels good in the hand, and is easy to use.",2022,06
Does not recharge never did light up as advertised,2022,06
As expected,2022,06
"This mouse worked well for about 4 months. Then, it stopped holding a charge.  Even tethered to the laptop, it was not working well.  But why buy a wireless mouse if it needs to be used wired. And why use a wired mouse if it doesn't even work. Don't waste your money. I'll go pull out my ancient wired mouse that works.",2022,06
Scroll wheel broke 2 weeks into having it and stopped working not even 6 months later.,2022,06
"This mouse really only worked for about two months. Now, it seems to need to be charged more frequently/takes a long time to charge and does not move smoothly. It sort of sticks to the point that it is very annoying to use.",2022,06
"Worked amazing just as advertised, but after a month, it has not been working anymore. It's not charging, little blue light appears and then it dies when it's charging. Thus, the cursor works for a few mins and then dies. It's really not charging anymore, i'm so disappointed.",2022,06
"Worked perfectly.  Was concerned it wouldn’t work with my new Samsung Galaxy Probook 360, but the little piece for the C drive worked great as soon as I attached the USB provided.  If you’re worried it won’t be compatible, don’t be!  It worked!",2022,06
I’ve had this mouse for about two months or less. It does not work. Will charge but only hold a bit of power for about 20 minutes and die🙁,2022,06
I honestly don’t dislike anything. It holds a charge for a couple of weeks and I also love that it’s slim. I also love how it changes colors. Nice little gadget. I highly recommend.,2022,06
Works Great,2021,07
"This mouse worked ok for a couple of months then, it just won't work anymore. I tried charging it and it just doesn't do it. Waste of Money.",2022,06
This is the best computer mouse I have ever bought. I like that you just recharge it.,2022,06
Much better than previous mouse devices I've used!,2022,06
I use this mouse all day every day at my desk job and have had to charge maybe once a week (It never dies on me I just take it upon myself) I keep it on the regular mouse mode as I don’t need all of the colors flashing but I have no complaints,2022,06
Lasted one day!,2022,06
"I bought this for my Surface Go and it didn’t work properly and instead of returning it I thought I would take it to work. I finally did so today, shame on me for not doing it earlier because it still isn’t working and now it’s too late to return it. It feels great and the lights are fun, just make sure you’re happy before the return window closes!",2022,06
"It was okay at first, it lagged a lot. I know it wasn’t an issue with my laptop cause i’ve used wireless mouses of different types before so i got this one. After a few days it completely stopped working. even after charging it, it refused to connect and work. definitely won’t buy this again and i’m letting my friend know not to get it either. it was just a letdown.",2022,06
"I purchased this mouse for my Thinkpad running linux and it worked like a charm. Set-up was a breeze, I simply plugged it in and it worked. It even works when I'm in the settings. This mouse is hard to beat for the price.",2022,06
"The mouse has a nice, small design, and I like how it feels when you click, but unfortunately the hardware is not high quality. The charging port has stopped working.",2022,06
"I purchased 2 mouse and both became defective after 1 month.  I reached out to the seller and advised me the mouse has a 1 year warranty and will send me 2 replacements. Up till this day, no replacements were recieved and the seller stopped responding to me. ***WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE***",2022,06
"The low profile of the mouse can cause wrist and hand fatigue, and unwanted inadvertent right clicks. Quiet as a mouse, literally. Subdued clicks. Nice led lighting, and rechargeable. Pretty good deal for the average low price.",2022,06
Meets my needs and I really enjoy it goes into sleep mode when not in use.,2022,06
Cheaply made.  USB C port is so poorly made it does not fit in port which makes the mouse worthless for use with my Surface. Mouse does not feel comfortable in hand. Just pass on this one.,2022,06
Long battery life due to sleep mode. Was impressed until scroll wheel stopped working.  Would have otherwise recommended highly,2022,06
The only problem I had with this item is that it doesn’t charge.,2022,06
I love the colors of the LED lights and the sleek size of the mouse itself but you can’t use the feature of wireless because it won’t hold a single charge. I’ve had it charged for 2 days now and it won’t work unplugged.,2022,06
I needed a small mouse for travel. It's working well. It has dpi settings which I haven't explored yet. I'm not crazy about it being rechargeable. I prefer batteries. But the rechargeable battery likely makes it lighter and smaller.,2022,06
"It’s been just over a month and it already broke, so disappointing because i did enjoy using it",2022,06
Just stopped working after seven months.,2022,06
I charged this brand new mouse and used it only for two weeks.; after the second week it stopped functioning. What a garbage!!!,2022,06
"Love th wmouse, but my wheel to scroll broke, so be careful",2022,06
It turns on but the left button does not work,2022,06
Loved at first but I've only used a handful of times and the middle rolling part broke so I can't scroll.,2022,06
I do presentations for work and I can plug my lap top into the television and use the mouse to advance slides…,2022,06
It works well with my laptop for everyday work.Has glitched occasionally when I’ve got the laptop docked with multiple monitors for gaming which is frustrating.For work - highly recommendFor gaming-  NOT recommended,2022,06
the clicker won’t work any more because the rolling piece broke,2022,06
"Just received this yesterday and plugged it in today. I have left it on the charger for longer than 2 hours because every time it says it is charged, I can not use it longer than 5 min before it goes dead. Like the look and feel of it but I did not buy it to used plugged in. Very disappointed and will have to buy something different. The box got thrown away so I guess it can not be returned at this point. Will give it one more day to try before choosing something different. I'd like to hope that I just got a lemon.",2022,06
Stopped holding a charge after only one week,2022,06
"I was so excited to receive this mouse. I chose it because the color with so nice ( I bought it in mint green) and the features of the multicolor led lights. However, to my surprise this mouse doesn’t hold charge. After maybe two hours of use it’s done and needs to be charged for a few hours In order to be used again. Naturally I went back to my original Apple mouse.",2022,06
Worked for about a week.,2022,06
Like that when not in use,2022,06
"For a cheap rechargeable mouse, this is great.",2022,05
"I like the fact that it lights not only can you see it in the dark, but it alerts you when the batteries or low",2022,06
"The perfect cute little mouse!Update: I had this mouse for a little less than a month, which was so perfect and then stopped working. Definitely wasted my money.",2022,06
Scroll wheel on/off switch broke without much use. It was good while it lasted but nothing too special. Mainly liked the shape,2022,06
I use this for my laptop mostly when I'm creating designs on my cricut. Works good! Lights up very nicely.,2022,06
Stopped working from one day to the next.,2022,06
The mouse worked great in the initial few weeks but then started having lag in movement and slowly it became so slow in movement that the click also stopped working 70% of the time. Disappointed as I bought this item after reading numerous positive reviews :(,2022,06
It broke in a week,2022,06
"OK I’d like to recommend that you really think about buying a mouse that requires charging via USB cable. Because when this puppy goes dead, you can’t work until you charge it.  I work from home, so I use my mouse from 8 AM until about 6 PM nonstop. I have to charge every day, otherwise I’m dead in about two days tops.So I do like the mouse, But unlike just popping in some new batteries and you’re good to go, you have to remember to CHARGE it!!  LOL!!",2022,06
I like everything,2022,06
Worked well with my laptop until it stopped working 6 months later,2022,06
Very ergonomic. Soft click. Like that it recharges and doesn't need batteries. I can plug it in overnight if I need to. But the charge lasts a long time. It is comfy,2022,06
"For the price, good product. Have not used it much yet, but will suit the purpose for small portable mouse.",2022,06
"Mouse is fine, but my usb c adapter was junk from the start. Be aware if you’re planning on using it in one of these ports.",2022,06
I have a mac book and I have been charging the mouse for 5 hours and it wouldn't connect. I have tried everything and looked up how to set up the mouse. But it didn't work.,2022,06
"I am enjoying my colorful mouse however, my mouse connected to the computer of someone else while in use during class. I have also been having trouble connecting to my personal computer when I am by myself.",2022,06
"I loved this mouse - it was so pretty and the glided really smoothly. Everything worked great for about a month and now the mouse won't turn on. I've charged it fully and whenever I attempt to turn the switch ""on"", it shuts right back off.That being said, I did buy another one. Being under $15, I don't mind having to replace it. Hopefully, it was a fluke with the first mouse and this second one will work for much longer than a few weeks. If the same thing happens again, I will not be purchasing a third.",2022,06
Great mouse overall. But the middle click button needs a lot of pressure to click which is quite annoy. Other than that I would have given it a 5 star.,2022,06
" Loved this mouse, but after a couple of months it started making a weird noise while scrolling. - 3 points for that",2022,06
Lasts long on initial charge. Perfect size!,2022,06
I don't use this everyday. Maybe twice a week.i love how quiet it is. But the scroll button stopped working. It now just continually spins... 😒,2022,06
I just use it as a regular mouse.,2022,06
Product didn’t work. Hard to right click,2022,06
" I decided to buy a mouse for my laptop for college. I really don't like laptop mouse pads. I prefer the click mouse. This one scrolls, right/left clicks, and moves smoothly. I do use it on a mouse pad which helps it move smoothly. It works on hard surfaces like my desk but not as smooth. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a mouse. Makes my online college classes easier. I've been using this for a out 2 months now and I e only charged it twice. Has a long battery life and sleep mode. To exit sleep mode just click the mouse once. Can't say I've seen any glitches that people are talking about. Maybe there's were defective. Mine works great. Thank you",2022,06
"This thing worked great the first time I used it, then wouldn't work at all. Won't charge, won't move the cursor. Total crap.",2022,06
Nice mouse worked great for my needs. Glides smooth holds charge well.,2022,06
"Was great until it fell less than a foot, onto carpet, and broke, the day after my return window. Will not recommend this to anyone due to how apparently fragile it is. Now I’m left with a broken mouse and disappointment.",2022,06
When I opened the box containing the product a bunch of white powder feel out. Not sure what it is but it's very unsettling. I checked for a silica packet or something it could have come from but found nothing. I washed really well but my hands are itching now might be an allergic reaction.,2022,06
I bought this mouse and use it for the first time yesterday and I charged it last night and now the mouse will not turn on. A definite waste of money!,2022,06
USB part broke inside of computer. Hardly used.,2022,06
"I bought this mouse for work, it was great at first. It’s supposedly rechargeable, I was able to charge it once fine. It died again days later, and now won’t charge or turn on. I’ve tried different cords, blocks, and outlets so I’m confident the problem is the mouse. This is useless.",2022,06
"Very beautiful and easy to use, but came apart after few months of using",2022,06
"Didn’t even work, sensitivity way to fast",2022,06
"Easy to navigate, lights add a touch of fun. I use this as my traveling mouse with my lightweight laptop. No complaints and no problems",2022,06
"It doesn’t come with the charger cord it claims to have .. just opened the box .. let’s see how it operates , once I find a charger cord for it 🤦‍♀️ Won’t waste my money here again",2022,06
I DROP IT ONCE... and it just completely breaks,2022,06
Less 2.5 months old. Worked great at first and now it won't charge. It's crap,2022,06
Really like the mouse until 2 months in it started having issues. Just trying to move the cursor across the screen became a struggle.,2022,06
"At first I was a little bit worried about the quality of this product, but let me tell you this worked out perfectly.",2022,06
"Review after 2 months use:I liked the mouse a lot , it was rechargeable, cool with lights. But it suddenly stopped working after 2 months. Very disappointed.",2022,06
The mouse is cute and light but it doesn't consistently work throughout the day. It will be working and then all of a sudden it will be non-responsive and has to be turned off and back on to get it to work again. Would not recommend.,2022,06
"Cute, light weight very easy to use. I love this mouse.",2022,06
iy works so what can one say about a mouse?,2022,06
Purchased as an alternative to a wired mouse along with having a spare to throw in my work bag in case of issues.  Ended up designating this mouse for use with my home security system and it’s working as expected.  No issues after the first charge.,2022,06
Have had this less than two months and it doesn’t work at all after hours of charging. Computer only recognizes clicks but no movement at all. Waste :/,2022,06
Stopped working after two months,2022,06
"Doesn't work at all. The two pieces barely even connect, let alone to the laptop.Waste of time and money.Cheaply made.",2022,06
Worked great until today. Scroll wheel no longer works. This is not even an item I use more than three times a month. Disappointing.,2022,06
"I only have 2 issues for this item.The charging cord fell apart 1 month after I received it.The mouse its self stopped working a few months after receiving it.  After reaching out to the manufacturer who promised to replace the item, which I never received, I am forced to buy another mouse but definitely not from this manufacturer.",2022,06
Love this mouse! So easy to use. Simple set up.,2022,06
"This is cute and slim and I love that I don't have to replace batteries, just charge it up when my computer is not in use. I use it for web browsing as well as basic gaming.",2022,06
"Absolutely terrible. The adapter doesn’t stay in the computer, the mouse doesn’t charge. Not a single good thing about it",2022,06
A dependable mouse for regular use not gaming. Thank you for a smooth transaction.,2022,06
Tiny Great for laptop Size.,2022,06
After a couple months my mouse died. Don’t buy this thing.,2022,06
I love the design and ease of use.  I’m older so I am used to using a mouse.  This works perfectly.,2022,06
"Didn't work very well from the very beginning. Then it was dropped in water, dried out, and was even worse. 😏",2022,06
Charge doesn’t last long at all! Feels cheap. Works for my 5 year old to use but nothing I would keep for myself.,2022,06
Very fragile when dropped.,2022,06
"The mouse is cute and work, but I do feel like there is some delay especially when Im working between 2 monitors. I've been using this mouse for a little over a month now and the right click just broke randomly so theres that.",2022,06
"Literally bought it today, it connected at first and upon turning it off after and turning it on it did not want to connect at all... I gave it a full charge and the battery only lasted up for 5min. Very disappointed",2022,06
"Scroll is not working properly after 6 months of usage, undoubtedly battery is very good though.",2022,06
"After using this product for only about 1 hour the wheel broke , so you can not use that feature. Very poor quality...Would not recommend this product.",2022,06
It's not the best. You get what you pay for.,2022,06
This mouse is the best!!  It's got a quiet click and has sleep mode as well.  I highly recommend!,2022,06
"I initially really enjoyed this mouse, it is a good size, the battery life is reasonable, and I'm a sucker for anything that lights up rainbow. I do wish that you could turn on just the mouse and not the lights without there being a constant red light.However! After using the mouse for less than 2 months, the scroll wheel stopped working and I can't figure out why. I've tried cleaning it out, recharging the battery, and adjusting my driver settings with no luck. I'm definitely frustrated and because my return window has past I'm not sure how to reach out to customer service. :(",2022,06
I was excited to get a mouse that was USB charge instead of batteries. Ive charged it once and it worked great for about a week which is awesome! But I have been trying to charge it now for 2 days and it will not accept a charge. Im past my return window and cannot get my money back or exchange it for a new one. This is a big bummer.....,2022,06
"Was a nice mouse while it lasted. It is not even 3 months old and not working, turns on but then nothing.",2022,06
"I JUST GOT THIS MOUSE AND DOESNT EVEN TURN ON AFTER CHARGING THE USB PLUG DOES NOT WORK AS WELL, THIS JUST ISNT A GOOD BUY IF I WAS YOU I WOULD GO FOR A DIFFERENT ONE CAUSE ITS A WASTE OF MONEY SO JUST SAVE IT AND LOOK FOR A DIFFERENT ONE",2022,06
If you can…spend the extra money and buy something a little better quality,2022,06
Worked for a couple months - doesn’t anymore,2022,06
If u not right hand suggest don’t buy it,2022,06
It was easy to install and worked the first time.,2022,06
Hi love it but I bought it because it changed colors and it only stays on red.,2022,06
"I've been through two of these mice. The first one lasted only one day before the scroll wheel stopped working. I opted for an exchange, but the new one had the same issue after about 3 weeks. Looking through reviews, it seems to be a common issue. Returning this for another brand.",2022,06
I love this mouse but I am so bummed it broke after 3 months!!! The roller ball completely stopped working but at least I could still use the mouse to navigate the screen.,2022,06
Scroll wheel completely stopped working after two months. The power cord also stopped charging the mouse after a few weeks of use. A complete waste of money.,2022,06
"Great design, fits great in your hand, easy to use... loved it for the month I've had it but... The scroll button just started spinning the last time I turned it on. That button no longer works, no scrolling for me. Left and Right still work and holds a great charge however I need to scroll and it is just past my return date 😔",2022,06
I was stunned by the quality of this great wireless mouse. With a charging port it never needs a battery since it is built-in. I've used the mouse for months and without recharging it goes and goes. A winner.,2022,06
IT WORKED FINE AND THEN STOP I BOUGHT TWO I HOPE THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T DIED TOO,2022,06
 Pros:-Quiet-Smooth-No delays or lagging issues so far-Pretty colors (when not moving the mouse)Cons:-Seems a bit cheap-A little flatter than I'd like; doesn't fit naturally to my palm so it makes it uncomfortable-The red optical light shines through the other pretty colors when you're moving the mouse.  I want to see the various colors (even when moving the mouse)---not a red LED light shining through which is overpowering.-Some of the colors shine all throughout and for much longer while others barely show.The right side of the mouse (I'm right-handed) doesn't emit the colors as vividly as the left side (next to my thumb).  One small section is almost inoperative.I'll probably be returning it as I have bought another mouse that also changes colors and it doesn't emit the red LED like this one.  It was super cheap fortunately in case I keep it.  Who knows!  I guess you get what you pay for.,2022,06
"I loved this mouse at first. However after just one one of using it, it just stopped working one day. Even after being charged the night before. Nothing seemed to bring it back to life. Very disappointed as I am outside of the return window BY ONE WEEK. Definitely do not recommend.",2022,06
Mouse was working fine for about a week now the middle button to scroll stop working,2022,06
I am big on reviews & peoples honest opinions when it counts. As for style it’s a nice mouse but for the main purpose of the mouse it is not good. Even if it’s completely charged it will only work for about 10/15 minutes before it starts to freeze & then eventually go dead. It’s very frustrating & annoying especially if you work from home. I would of posted a pic but I am in the process of returning it & don’t feel like getting it.,2022,06
"I love the rotating colors on the mouse but it doesn't run by batteries. This seems pretty cool at first because you save money on having to buy double a's but then you have to think about remembering to charge it. If you've been using it all day non stop, it starts to die by the night time. Other than that i think it's super cute. and it's pretty good and accurate with pointing even on shiny surfaces I didn't have much of an issue.",2022,06
I love the sleekness,2022,06
This worked great for 4 months. Then it just stopped working. It's fully charged but won't work. Tryed changing adapter and still doesn't work. Not an expensive mouse but not worth anything if it doesn't work.,2022,06
It stopped working,2022,06
they won't hold a charge,2022,06
It's works okay but my scrool wheel doesn't work and it never jad,2022,06
Love it as it’s multi functional,2022,06
"Got these for the kids Chromebook's, best thing yet.  Kids like the lights and they are easy for them to use.",2022,06
I just needed a wireless mouse for at work because I was sick of the cord the company issued mouse had.  The color is bright and the lights are a nice subtle change to working…they’re pretty.  The only thing I hate is that I have to bounce it on the mousepad to wake it up.  Nothing major but the sensor could be better.  It’s not overwhelmingly wonderful but it’s cute and is a good value considering the cost.,2022,06
So easy to hold. Just plug in the wireless receiver and turn on the power switch on the bottom of the mouse and start using. No batteries to install because the mouse is wireless.,2022,06
I bought this mouse for my Macbook and it would not even turn on! I charged it all day and it would not work or connect to my laptop. It just flashed a red color like the battery was dead and that was that happened. Save yourself some money and look for another mouse elsewhere. I should've just gone to best buy or target.,2022,05
"I was using this mouse to play sims 4 on my mac book and it was working great for about a month and then yesterday all of a sudden it just flatlines. The only light that comes on is when i turn it on, I’ve tried to unplug, turn on, and turn off the mouse I even went as far as to reboot my computer. I swear to God of the seller emails me to take this down i’m gonna go off!! THIS ITEM IS TERRIBLE!!!! DO ❌NOT❌BUY❌",2022,06
"Its a good mouse and its different from your standard mouse, I like the fact it lights up.",2022,06
Battery lasted less than 2 minutes after charging for 2 hours. Connected to my laptop just fine.,2022,06
I bought one of these and in three months it completely stopped working. I couldn’t charge it or use it. I bought a second one thinking the first one was a bad one and the second one did the same thing. Buy something more reputable. I would not recommend buying this product.,2022,06
This mouse did not work from the get-go which is why I am certain I was not it's first owner. This mouse was missing the one part it needed to operate (a USB receiver) which is customarily located securely under the unit itself. The mouse was halfway in a sleeve as if RE-stuffed back into it's original packaging. Returning this immediately,2022,06
Very cool design thanks,2022,06
Liked but not for me!  Needed bluetooth.,2022,05
"Worked for only a week. When I went to recharge it for the first time, the light went on for a minute and then just shut off. One use mouse.",2022,05
It works fine- just seems a little cheap and not real comfortable.,2022,05
Long lasting battery!!!,2022,05
This mouse came broken very upset it was delivered in time but the devise itself was broken the package was opened it wasn’t even inside the actual box it’s ridiculous definitely going to get my money back I gave it a star because I had no choice but too 😡👎🏾,2022,05
"I’m very comfortable ergonomically feel, internal rechargeable batteries, and instant connection while setting up for the first time. Took less than 10 seconds from taking it out of the box to working. The button press is also really smooth and doesn’t feel like a hard click. The roller knob at the top is fairly smooth and the transitional LED lighting looks really good. Very happy with this purchase",2022,05
"It was easy to connect and worked great then It worked for a while , was perfect then it job stopped working out of nowhere",2022,05
It states that it has a usbc converter but it does not work,2022,05
"I do like the mouse, but the usb-c connector does not go all the way in to my macbook, which is frustrating.",2022,05
I wanted to love this mouse. The first one randomly stopped working for no reason. It was past the return window so I bought another one hoping it was just a fluke or that I did something wrong even though I’m sure I didn’t. I bought a second one and that one too stopped working randomly after the return window closed. I won’t be buying this again,2022,05
"Recharges,  easy to use. I use it as my travel mouse. Would recommend it.",2022,05
Do not drop the mouse on the floor. Very sensitive and broke right away after having it for a year. So this is the second one I ordered. Works very well and has cute colors.,2022,05
"Had high hope for this cute product. Was very disappointed. For starters, the charging light did not work so I couldn't tell if it was charging at all. When I tried it the next day after charging it did work (only directly plugged into my mac, wouldn't work in my adaptor which is another issue) and it worked that day. The next day it would not work. Already annoyed as I wasn't looking to charge this all day to work for only work hours. I did turn it off after each use as well. The next day it worked for even less time. Maybe only a couple of hours. This mouse is cheap junk and I don't recommend it to anyone.",2022,05
"The mouse was decent for the price. However I'm now just about 2 weeks out of my return window, and the scroll stopped working on the mouse 2 days ago. Was hoping it was a random, temporary issue but it seems it's permanent. I'm disappointed that I can't at least return or exchange the item and now have to go and buy a new mouse..",2022,05
have had this item since March and now when I scroll down using the roller it squeaks and is very annoying,2022,05
"Really liked it at first, especially since it charges and doesn't need a battery. BUT... the courser jumps EVERYWHERE!!!! I have accidentally closed out my browser and all my tabs several times. Once during a meet with my boss where I was PRESENTING!!! Of course, now that I have definitely decided this mouse sucks and I want to return it, the window is closed. DON'T BUY THIS MOUSE!",2022,05
"I like that is a quiet mouse; however, one side of the mouse stopped working. I was going to see if can get an exchange and missed it by 4 days. broken in less than 1 month.",2022,05
It works,2022,05
works great,2022,05
Doesn’t hold good charge,2022,05
"The laser is broken, it jumps everywhere on the screen.",2022,05
"The mouse seems to work fine and looks nice, but arrived very dirty. The box being dirty I can understand due to shipping, but the mouse itself has lint, a few pieces of pet hair, and the track scroll is dirty as if it’s been used a lot. It was not described as used, but very much appears to be and I’m upset to pay full price for something that has definitely been out of the box.",2022,05
Worked beautifully for a month and then the roller ball broke. I guess you get what you pay for.,2022,05
Does not last x,2022,05
I admit that I might have overused it since I bought it for my work from home.. BUT my sis got a similar one which is why I bought this one and THAT one actually lasts days without the need of a chargeI needed to charge this one multiple times on the day and at one point it just wouldn't work even while plugged in so I still needed to switch to the old oneIt is really disappointing idk if a got a faulty product or if that is actually the extent of its productivity,2022,05
Ergonomic for gaming,2022,05
The first few weeks it worked great then all of a sudden the scroll stopped working and it just spins.I have to physically grab the side of the page to move down. Really disappointed ☹️,2022,05
Stopped working after a couple months.,2022,05
3 months later and it does not work.,2022,05
"I haven't used this product for at least a day and it is already not working!!!! It doesn't track properly to my computer, this is the worst mouse save your money and don't buy this",2022,05
I purchased gold they sent black. Tried to send it back but Amazon couldn’t afford gas so the place I needed to return it to was inconvenient so I kept it. Big mistake. I got it at end of April  and the scroll portion is already broken. A sham of mouse and company.,2022,05
I have purchased two of this product in the past year (one to replace the other). On both of the the scroll button stopped working. I dropped the first one and I understood why it stopped working. The second one I did not drop. It just quit working after 3 months. Cute and light weight but not long lasting enough for me.,2022,05
Function well at work still.,2022,05
Horrible quality. The wheel stopped working only after a few hours. It is very light and feels very cheap.,2022,05
"My first concern is that it does not give you a warning when it needs recharging, it just dies out, If you are using your USB for something else, you have to stop what you are doing to plug in the mouse.  Second, the charge does not last long. Very frustrating.  And now the most important - It Died!  Just stopped working.  Oh well, so much for fancy; I'm going back to battery operated mouse.",2022,05
"The title of my post says a lot. I also like how lightweight it is. It’s very responsive to movement, but not overly so. It’s as good a wireless mouse as I’ve ever had.",2022,05
"The mouse itself was wonderful! It installed within seconds and was very smooth operating. It fit well in my small hand and there was no clicking noise. I wish it worked out as I liked the mouse itself.The only issue is not the mouse itself, but my sensitivity to the LED/optical lights. I got a  migraine from it. The LED light can be turned off, so that in itself could be remedied. But the optical light which is a bright red showed through the side lights, the gap between the switches and the DPI option switch. There was no way of blocking the light. I was really sad I had to return it.",2022,05
"Works as expected, love this mouse!",2022,05
"I work from home and I work 8-12 hours a day depending if I do overtime or not so I needed a mouse because my wireless mouse of 5 years was dying. Now, I got this mouse in hopes it would work great because of all the reviews. The first day I got this mouse it was very uncomfortable so right off the bat I knew I didn’t like flat mouses because it was cramping my hand. Second, the cursor was glitching. Unfortunately I cannot attach a video because it would be on company property and I don’t have a personal computer. I’ll have it on one side of the screen and automatically it will go to the other. If you like mouses like this and can deal with the glitching then that’s fine but for me I hated it. Very frustrating.",2022,05
"Good size and shape, but unfortunately the scrolling wheel broke un the first month.",2022,05
"Started off great, but the charge stopped working, couldn’t tell if it needing charging, one day it didn’t turn on, left it to charge while it was off and on 2 hours each way and it still wouldn’t hold a charge or turn on. Battery ended up exploding and started leaking acid. Overall horrible product",2022,05
"It worked for the first hour I bought it. I went to charge it. It no longer works, turns on, or charges.",2022,05
Works as a mouse should work.,2022,05
In the second week it stoped to work and the item is very light I wouldn’t never buy it again or from this seller,2022,05
Real good and the charge last a lot.,2022,05
It is so nice to use it with my laptop,2022,05
"The mouse seemed nice when I got it and has a great feel in your hand with quiet clicks. However, after 3 weeks of every other day use the scroll wheel stopped working. I returned it for a replacement and now, 3-4 weeks after receiving the replacement, that scroll wheel has also stopped working. Because the original purchase was outside the return window, a return was not possible. Would not buy again, and am going with a different product from a different seller/manufacturer.",2022,05
The scroll wheel broke,2022,05
The Best! Ergonomic and lightweight. Feels comfortable after hours of use at my laptop. Fits perfectly in the pocket of a laptop bag. Not bulky like others I've tried. Stays charged for a long time. I love the color.,2022,05
It's slim not bulky works well with my laptop love the lights great buy,2022,05
you dont hear any clicking like normal mouses which is nice. The color is good and smooth as well. My only complaint is you have to move it back and forth sometimes to wake it up. Rather than that its a perfect mouse when its awake.,2022,05
"Nice size, comfortable,  good battery life and plug in play.",2022,05
"It seems to work fine so far.  The lights around the side are constantly red until well charged, but then they rotate.  Very easy to set up, but does not seem to work when wired.",2022,05
"Mouse worked great! was easy to connect and use. But stopped working and had to throw it away after 3-4 months of use. stopped charging, stopped working all together.",2022,05
looks so cheap. didn't even work properly.,2022,05
This mouse stops working even when fully charged and the light on the bottom is on. This did not start happening until 6 weeks after the return window ended. I would not recommend buying this for these reasons. It was a waste of money.,2022,05
I love the colors.,2022,05
"Purchased December 3 2021 quit working May 5, 2022. Will not hold a charge and will not turn on.",2022,05
"You get what you pay for, I guess. They were great at first. But then one of them, the USB port bent and broke and took the jaws of life to pull out of our USB port; the second one, the top of the mouse fell off.",2022,05
It’s super cute and I love how it lights up. Which is probably the reason why the charge doesn’t last very long. Just make sure you stay on top of it and it will work. I’m trying to avoid buying one with batteries but this one is in any better.,2022,05
"I really liked the idea of a rechargeable mouse, but the wheel button stopped working after 40 days and it is needed for my job and the programs I use. I guess I got what I paid for.",2022,05
"its not wireless, i use the mouse for my hp elitebook and the only way i can use it if i have the charger connected",2022,05
Excelente,2022,05
Very loud with every click !!!!!!,2022,05
The mouse arrived today. Easy to set up. So far it is working properly. I like the fact that it's rechargeable. No more AA battery to replace. I'll have to get use to its size. A lot shorter than my old Morosoft mouse. Hope it lasts as long as the old mouse. Time will tell.,2022,05
work~ very slow,2022,05
Scroller is squeaky and makes noise. Seems loose,2022,05
Poor quality. Difficult to replace battery,2022,05
"I really liked the mouse at first, it matched perfectly and was very convenient. First thing i noticed was how plasticy it was, that didn't bother me tho. One day as i was using the mouse to scroll, the little scroll wheel fell into the mouse! i tried to fix it and i couldn't. I wasn't pressing hard on it and it always stayed on my desk. Its a cute mouse, love the look of it. But it is very cheaply made and will most likely break!",2022,05
"Not sure why this died after a couple months of use, but it is no longer working. Bummer because it was super cute and added to my office aesthetic.",2022,05
"Worked great initially. It was cute and charged easily and quickly. Now, after 8 months, it glitches and does not glide smoothly and will not hold a charge. Would not recommend.",2022,05
It’s a cool looking mouse but only lasted 3 months until it stopped working.,2022,05
It was good for the three days before it diedBad product or quality control. At least. it was not expensive!,2022,05
"Honestly it’s far less heavy than I would’ve liked. I don’t feel as though this will be adequate for long-term gaming but it’ll be alright for web surfing or writing. It’s also fairly small, then again I have pretty large hands. For the price, I couldn’t ask for much more, but I do think it’s important to inform people of its cons regardless of how cheap it is. Also, it DOES work with a macbook air despite the one star reviews. You have to connect the receiver to the adapter (it takes a good bit of force) and then plug it into the computer. I wish the instructions could’ve been more clear about that, but it’s whatever:",2022,05
This mouse is just trash. It’s lifespan is 32 days. Stopped working just 2 days after the return window closed. I don’t recommend purchasing if you want something that is actually functional and long lasting. Getting tired of Amazon allowing vendors sell junk without recourse.,2022,05
Didn’t realize that there wasn’t a place to put a battery in so it always had to be charged. After two or three weeks I could no longer charge it and could not have it work. Cheaply made would not recommend if you need it long-term or if you spend a lot of time on the computer,2022,05
"While working with MacBook Pro, frequently mouse is getting disconnected. I need to take the dongle out and then attach for reconnection. Wouldn't recommend if you are using type c port.",2022,05
Worked for 2 minutes the first time I turned on the mouse and then it just completely stopped working with my MacBook. Charged it for days and still does not work.,2022,05
I liked this mouse just fine.  I bought it to use at school with my chromebook.  It was fine until a couple weeks ago. I scrolled the mouse wheel and something broke. Now the wheel just spins and spins and does nothing.  I only used it a few times a week for meetings and such. I would buy a better one; don't bother with this one.,2022,05
This mouse is great quality and duration is excellent. This mouse goes uncharged for 2 months while being a university student. I realize recently it have been giving a little problem. Hopefully the seller can assist with this. Great but otherwise,2022,05
I loved the product!!!,2022,05
Great product,2022,05
Mouse battery doesn’t charge,2022,05
"Pretty but the quality is very poor. It is rechargeable, which was a selling point but the quality isn't there.",2022,05
I use this mouse for my laptop.  I love that it’s super smooth and very quick.,2022,05
Very comfortable and feels great,2022,05
"Charged up quickly in a little over an hour.  Looks great, feels great, but the scrolling wheel does not work.  Looking at it closely, it looks like the wheel is slightly off center.  It spins freely, like it isn't connected to anything.  Back it goes.",2022,05
" Absolutely love it! And it is rechargeable, changes colors. The battery lasts forever.  5 stars",2022,05
The mouse itself is nice but the USBc part does not fit into my surface nor does the USB part fit.  I bought this because i have a new surface and needed a USBc to USB connection so i could use the mouse with the surface.  I guess the specs are different in China.i had to go back and buy a USBc so i could use the mouse.  Attached is a picture of the one i had to buy.Do not recommend unless you want a project.,2022,05
"The tracking ball/wheel stopped working after a couple of months. Thinking I broke the tracking wheel, I ordered a new one and it arrived with the same issue straight out of the box. It works fine if you don't mind not having the tracking wheel.",2022,05
The scroller doesn’t work. Mouse feels generic,2022,05
"Just so you know, I loved the simple Amazon wireless mouse, but our cats kept knocking it off the table and the battery cover would come off. Over and over (stupid cats!) But now, with this mouse, the battery is rechargeable, the cats can't tear it apart, and it has cool lights on it. The function is good, the price was low, everything is solid--so, I recommend it.",2022,05
I’ve only had this for a few months now and it is completely broken. The scroll feature lost its traction and no longer works. The battery life wasn’t great and it never worked flawlessly. I need a new mouse now 🥺,2022,05
I don’t like that I need to replug it in my laptop to get it to work every time I use it,2022,05
i like,2022,05
This is a clean simple design.  Completely simple to install.,2022,05
Perfect mouse,2022,05
Horrible. Just horrible,2022,05
"Great mouse, nothing super fancy.  Comfortable to use.  The lights are pretty cool but there is an option to not have them on which is great to extend battery life. Holds a charge really well and will still work with the usb charger plugged in if necessary. I plugged in to 2 different computers and worked immediately on both. Seems quite reaponsive, but I only use it for general computer work so i dont know how it would work for gaming. All in all great mouse for a decent price.Will update if anything changes",2022,05
"This mouse is so cute, the chip is a little challenging to get out but works amazing and the colors are adorable",2022,05
"Mouse is fine, but needs frequent charging",2022,05
Perfect,2022,05
"I have not had this mouse for a little over 10 days. I love the feel of the mouse and how sleek it is HOWEVER no matter how much I charge the mouse, it stops responding after about 5 minutes of use. I have found myself removing the dongle from my laptop several times a day just to make the mouse respond. I bought the mouse to improve my work functionality to no avail.",2022,05
This item only worked for Less than 30 days it was going well and then stopped holding a charge,2022,05
I got this mouse April12th and it just stopped working May 19th so i cannot return it. I loved this mouse but sad it stopped working,2022,05
"Just got the item today, everything works out great but the usb could not fit into the adapter, neither could any other usb's. As seen in the picture they all try to go in sideways and thats why they wont fit. So, even though the product works just fine, I am unable to use it which is why its a three star. Regardless, if you have normal usb ports, this product will work just fine!",2022,05
"Works well, very responsive",2022,05
"It worked good at first but it will not respond anymore, even after being fully charged. Waste of money. It’s cute though. Good thing it stopped working right away so I can still return it 😒",2022,05
This product does not work with my Macbook Air A2337 it worked last night when I first opened the box and it already won't keep a charge or charge at all. Buyer beware.,2022,05
"Worked great, very pretty (aquamarine color), easy you use, precise and then suddenly died today. Stop charging, so after a few months it departed this world without a sound. Not worth it. Wish it did. I'm going to order from another maker.",2022,05
Complete junk. Never worked. Don’t waste your money because it’s pretty,2022,05
Got this to try to alleviate hand pain from using a traditional mouse. Helped enough shape wise but the battery is so short that it doesn’t last a day. I was using for work so that is a problem.,2022,05
"The mouse came as described with the option I chose. However, after letting it charge for the recommended time before use, it would not connect to my computer. Turned it off and then back on and it worked for about 30 minutes. Within that 30 minutes, only showed one color the whole time. It never worked again afterwards. Just went and bought a $10 mouse from walmart and it works like perfect, even more sturdier than this one. Don’t waste your money on this.",2022,05
Don’t waste your money on this. Mine stop working within the first month of having it.,2022,05
Dies way too quickly. The product itself is so light and feels cheaply constructed; I wish I could have returned it.,2022,05
"Have to charge it twice a day at least.It is not comfortable, too small to fit nicely in my hand.The flow is choppy, the cursor sticks.It feels cheap, like it is going to break at any second.",2022,05
"don't waste your time, horrible quality and does not work with macbook air",2022,05
"After only a 3 months.....MY MOUSE NO LONGER WORKS. I am so upset because I LOVEDDDDD THIS MOUSE. It's slim and fits in my laptop bag easily and everything. It checked off everything on my list, but no matter how long I charge it now, it will flash and stop working. I'm so sad, and now the return window has passed and now I can't even return it.:(",2022,05
The mouse is very good and I love the colors but it seems to go into sleep mode way too often??  Unfortunately my mouse stopped working after a few weeks after purchase??,2022,05
Stopped working after 3 months. Trash,2022,05
"Mouse was advertised as quiet, but it is far from quiet. It has the loudest sound I have ever heard from a mouse when clicking the middle button.  Disappointed in the clearly false advertising.",2022,05
"I was so excited, this mouse looks beautiful! But... it was one of the most frustrating devices I have ever used. When clicking to wake it up it would click on whatever may be on the screen at the moment, including email or IM drafts that have not yet been reviewed or perhaps written in anger and did not mean to send lol.When you wanted to click on something, you had to click several times. Overall frustrating. Very good return process, no questions asked and quick refund. That's why 2 stars.",2022,05
Sensor is all whacked out.  Stopped working at 34 days so I’m out the money and have to purchase a new mouse.  Don’t do it,2022,05
 I loveddddddd my mouse super excited 😆 but I’m used to clicking the scrolling piece to create the auto scroll well I did it and now my scrolling piece is broken 😞 .. sooooo don’t push the scrolling piece ! But overall I love it and it instantly connected to my MacBook Pro and everything was working great !,2022,05
It stopped working only after 2 months.,2022,05
"Its pretty, but the charge doesn't last long. I plug it in to my laptop to charge, but the laptop shuts down after a few minutes and the mouse quits charging. There is a short charging cord but no adaptor to plug it into the wall. And it says not to use cell phone charging adaptors.. So recharging was a pain.",2022,05
The scroll broke within 2 hours of taking out of package. Can still use it to open tabs but can't scroll.,2022,05
"Terrible product. Does not work well. Glitches, causes cursor to makes sudden unintended changes in direction without in use. Would not recommend",2022,05
"When I first got it, it did not track properly unless fully charged. I stopped using it and recharged it all last night and now it does not work at all. Lights flash for a few seconds and then it goes black. Wish this product would have worked properly.",2022,05
"I received 2 of these for Christmas, they both stopped working within the first 2 weeks of having them. I emailed customer service as they tell you to and never got a response. I emailed them twice. Junky and a waste of money for the purchaser who gifted them to me.",2022,05
I was a bit too busy with work and school and  missed my window to return this item. The quality of the mouse and USB plug is just horrible. I ordered the mouse with urgency to get a power point project done for schooland had to run to a local discount store to purchase another mouse because the USB piece fell apart and after careful putting it back together the mouse won’t connect.Over I got about 45 minutes of use fromThis product.,2022,05
"I gave gaming 1 star because i don't do gaming. The mouse is worth every penny. Love how it feels, love that it makes no noise. you must use a mouse pad.",2022,05
THIS MOUSE ONLY WORKED FOR 2 WEEKS THEN IT DIED! VERY DISAPPOINTED,2022,05
"Stopped working, very conveniently after return window had closed.",2022,05
"Won’t recharge, lasted not even a week.",2022,05
Works great. Sleeps and comes out of sleep easily. Colorfully not too bright to be a distraction.,2022,05
Works as advertised... Would buy again,2022,05
Great price Great product,2022,05
Tends to lose juice quickly and not so great with my MacBook Pro. Another mouse added to the boneyard,2022,05
Great product,2022,05
"This was a great value and the wireless mouse works well. The colors are fun too, just wish it had a way to keep it on one color.",2022,05
 super cute for the office!  love the one lights!,2022,05
This product is cheap and does not last long. After only one day of use i plug it into the outlet and it does not turn on. I needed a gaming mouse and this one is definitely not it. Extremely upset,2022,05
"The type c extension doesn't work, so it rendered it  useless for my Mac. I am able to use it on my pc for work... just not the intended use I bought it for.. the mouse itself is great. Light, easy to use, fits perfectly in my hand, always connects and is reliable.",2022,05
I bought this mouse a few months ago. It worked very well for a couple of months and now it has quit completely. I’m sorry to say my return time ended in April. Buyer beware!,2022,05
"I like the mouse, it is cheaper quality though, the mouse didnt really look exactly like the picture but overall its not bad.",2022,05
"My son uses it at school. He is 9 years old,  when I asked him this ? He said ""it's good, better than my other one"" that's it",2022,05
"Like other reviews stated this mouse is super nice, smooth, and looks neat but lasted just over the 30 day return window.  I put it on charge for the 4th time since I had received it and the blue light comes on indicating it is charging and goes off some time later indicating it is complete.  When you switch it on the red light flashes and then goes off.  Highly disappointing.",2022,05
The item would charge but then would not turn on or work at all in the computer,2022,05
"I tried to get my daughter a nice mouse for her Minecrafting and man, what a waste of $20 this mouse was x 2! It connected to its included dongle just fine, but I almost broke a nail taking the dongle out of the mouse body. If you don't have something slim to wedge in between the dongle and the mouse body, prepare for some ouchies. Do you like the rainbow effect? Well, I hope you also enjoy less than 1 day of battery life. Is your battery dead now? Welp, can't charge and use the mouse at the same time. Do you think it'd be nice to use a long, braided USB cord as a wire for this mouse? Nope, the Micro USB only supports charging...not data. Don't hate yourself? Don't get a budget mouse.If you want a good mouse for roughly $15 more, check out the Razer Basilisk X - it supports Bluetooth & USB, and it has excellent battery life. My son uses it every day for Minecraft/Roblox/YouTube and I purchased it at the end of January. It is now Mid-May and I've changed its single AA only once. You won't be disappointed.",2022,05
Cheap. Charge barely last long and charging stopped working after a couple of months. Don’t buy.,2022,05
My daughter loves it! Cute color and works great!,2022,05
"It’s lightweight, works great, with really decent battery life. I don’t use the lights mode though which probably helps.",2022,05
Really in photo it looks more beautiful and of better quality than when you have it in personThe color has disappointed me since I expected it to be more stylish and with better finishes.,2022,05
Stays charged,2022,05
Piece of junk. doesn't work probably why it's on sale.,2022,05
It stopped working after 3 months right in the middle of my shift at work.,2022,05
Good product,2022,05
We bought this for my son to use and it lasted 3 months before the scrolling wheel broke.,2022,05
 It’s cute and light weight but one drop and it’s done for! I literally dropped it once and it now doesn’t work!,2022,05
"Love the sleek design, easy set up, fast charging, and most importantly how quiet the mouse isIt's not the most ergonomic mouse and it lacks wrist support so I have to stretch a lot more but as long as you're not gaming 24/7 this mouse is great.",2022,05
"It may be pretty to look at but it requires constant charging.  No warning when low on charge so if you are in the middle of using your USB port to hear music or watch a DVD, you have to stop, unplug it just to charge the mouse. Very frustrating.  I'm going back to batteries.",2022,05
 For $10-15 USD you can’t go wrong.,2022,05
"The mouse started off great. I even got two, one for me and one for my son. They both failed about the same time. It charges for hours and then when I switch it on it has a double red blink and does not react. Same thing when plugged in.",2022,05
"It broke at the first fall and it was not a big fall.The inner clips on broke and the other twisted, so I am unable to close it, and simpler does it work.",2022,05
I liked the color and the lights but unfortunately the scroll wheel went out on me. This item only lasted me a little over 3 months.,2022,05
"Laptop slipped of my lap and obviously landed on thw protuding hardware, troubling as i have much to do, ive not  acustomed to the finger pad 100%",2022,05
"Had troubles connecting, when it did finally connect the cursor never appeared only the clickable buttons worked and would access random menus.Returned for full refund.",2022,05
Love it fyi use the usb under mouse and push hard no clear instructions,2022,05
It doesn't charge anymore. . .,2022,05
I was very disappointed when the mouse stopped responding after a few weeks of using it,2022,05
"I’ve had this mouse for 2 months. And the wheel broke. It’s the second mouse I’ve gotten like it and that other mouse wheel broke.It much be cheap plastic.It looks nice, felt nice. But not worth it when you have to buy one every 2 months",2022,05
This has been a great addition to my gaming set up. It's perfect size for my 5 year old who loves using it for homework,2022,05
"The mouse started off okay. It worked like it should for a few weeks but then the battery would not make it through my work day. The charge lasted less each time until suddenly it stopped holding a charge. Like other reviews state, it stopped working literally days after the return window closed. I'll be buying a name brand mouse now.",2022,05
This is the best mouse! Super quite and small. I love it so much! The colors are fabulous!,2022,05
Perfect size for small hands,2022,05
Within 1 month the scroller stopped working.,2022,05
I bought this mouse for my work laptop. The right click on the mouse is constantly getting stuck and the left click seems to take several pushes before it recognizes what it is supposed to do. Overall I wouldn't buy this again. I would definitely recommend spending allitle more and getting a better mouse to get the job done.,2022,05
"This mouse is cheap and I like the colors, but the laser isn’t accurate, so it can be slow and laggy. Occasionally, its entirely unresponsive.",2022,05
Love this mouse,2022,05
I bought this as a wireless mouse. I have used it for less than a month and it doesn’t hold a charge unless it’s plugged in. I will be returning it and I do NOT recommend this product.,2022,05
"Just didn't work for me, could not plug into my Chromebook.",2022,05
Light and the clicks are very quiet. It's durable. I especially like the fact it light up and change colors,2022,05
It's a nice sleek mouse and works relatively well until it stops charging. I had bought it early march this year and now early May it won't charge making it a hunk of useless plastic. Buy with the expectation you will have to buy again and not very long thereafter.,2022,05
"I bought my mouse a few months ago and it was working just fine. Now, the scroll wheel sunk into the mouse and stopped working.",2022,05
excelente producto,2022,05
"Very disappointed.  The mouse doesn't hold a charge!  Even if you leave it ""on"" for a short period of time while not using it, you must recharge it.  Would not buy again.",2022,05
I returned the same day received.  Very poor quality and requires a cord to charge - no battery,2022,05
"This lightweight mouse worked fine for about three weeks, then it stopped working. I would plug it in to charge, and after about 20 seconds, it would stop charging. No charge = no power. Disappointing.",2022,05
"cheaply made, breaks after on use. If you want to waste your money get it",2022,05
"My other wireless mouse stopped working for some reason and required batteries, so i had to get another one. I love that it is rechargable and has the lights. the lights change each time you touch the mouse on its side. thats cool. i also love how the top of the mouse is so smooth and the gold color is actually shiny. i didnt know before buying but it has a sleep mode so thats great for if i forget to turn it off. i have to double check the manual but there are 3 switches and i dont know what the middle switch is for since the mouse hasnt worked in that function. i think its cool too that they include the adapter if you need to plug it into a usb-c port to connect to your device. I honestly like it. only other thing is im not sure how i know when its dying, again may be in the manual.",2022,05
I've loved this mouse since I bought the first one. I will continue to use it,2022,05
"I needed a really simple mouse for my laptop, so I got a nice combination for cheap/ease. It fits fairly nicely in my hands, super slim so it fits in my laptop bag without any issues!",2022,05
"Accent lights make it easy to find.  AFTER 97 DAYS THE SCROLLING WHEEL FAILED, not a good buy.",2022,05
"I use this with my desk top Mac.  Like it way better than the glass apple mouse.  Can actually utilize more features with it too on the right click. Glides easy and I have had no problems with it which is more than I can say for the apple mouse.  !5 years with Apple products which I love, but their mouse is a crappy design.Looks good, but who cares?  this one is reasonably priced ( great price actually for what you get.)  I give this mouse two thumbs up.",2022,05
"This mouse won’t track straight! And I learned that if I turn off the led lights with the bottom switch it tracks pretty well obviously there’s a bad design here leds are interfering with mouse tracking, I’ve just been turning off the leds to use it!",2022,05
It worked very well till it didn’t anymore. I bought this in January and it won’t charge or do anything. Very disappointed,2022,05
"This was a really good mouse, quiet clicks, very lightweight and it moved smoothly over my mouse pad.It fell, opened up a bit, I was able to put it clip it back in, but after the third fall, the ball stopped working. But for the price, it's def worth it.Long battery life, think I charged like middle of every other week. And I used it from weekdays for about 6 hours.",2022,05
This mouse us nit very comfortable.  I keep hitting the R button and bringing up pages I don't want.  The cursor jumps sound the page without my moving the mouse.  Charge doesn't last long.  It's fun to watch all of the flashing colors.,2022,05
"There's a typo on the mouse 🤣Mouse works good, though there is a minor glitch where it tends to not want to move on screen for a couple seconds after touching it after a couple minutes of inactivity.",2022,05
"Cute mouse, but that’s about it. Very flimsy and poor quality feeling. I like that it’s rechargeable. I’ve had this for a few months now and it’s stopped working. It’s charged, clean, clear of debris, and on a mousepad, but still doesn’t work for more than a few seconds. Waste of money.",2022,05
"Got a mouse for my son. The light look cool and it was comfortable. No complaints until the trackball quit working after about 9 days. I contacted the company, they communicated well, and replaced it very quickly. About a week later, the same thing happened again. Great communication and no issues with a refund. So, good communication but not the best mouse.",2022,05
Liked the colors and style east set up but after about 3 weeks of use the scroller stopped working and fell off track only used it a few times out of those 3 weeks.,2022,05
"Bought this to use for my Mac. I'm already on Big Sur (11.x), turns out the mouse is only compatible with 10.x",2022,05
I like that I can use the charger it came with to charge it! No batteries required!!,2022,05
It’s work good but not great,2022,05
Use this for my laptop and easy to use and works great. Very smooth. Would definitely recommend.,2022,05
This barely ever needs to be charged for me. I have online schooling so I use the mouse a lot and only have to charge it every once and a while. Its very pretty and good for the price! Makes no sound when clicked which is great.,2022,05
"Great little mouse- precisely what I was looking for except that it only lasted 2 months. I've had it just that long and the scroll wheel is now disconnected and doesn't work anymore. The mouse is still functional otherwise, but I use the scroll wheel constantly for work so I will just keep it as a backup and find something else.",2022,05
The charging stopped working after 4 months and entire mouse stopped working after 5 months,2022,05
It just stopped working out of nowhere. I’m mad I missed my return date.,2022,05
I just received this yesterday and am planning to return it.  Seems very cheaply made product.  Not taking the chance…,2022,05
"So far a great purchase, I bought rose gold and it looks so cute! Mouse works well, slim and compact.",2022,05
When I plug the USB into the computer it takes away my Internet settings. I cannot connect to the Internet and it shows no networks to connect to. I don’t know how to fix it.,2022,04
" So far, so good! Does what it's supposed to do. Worked right out of the box. I like that I don't have to buy batteries for it. It charges quickly, lasts a looking time, and is compatible with my HP Chromebook. It has two settings; solid red color (only when mouse is moving), and slow-changing rainbow (when mouse is moving and/or at rest). The USB tucks away into the bottom of the mouse, which is where you'll find it when you open the box for the first time. Also comes with an adapter and short charging cable.",2022,04
"Loved the product at first, I actually bought two. After a couple weeks they quit charging and now they no longer work.",2022,04
"Ergonomic, smooth, and quiet this is the third one I’ve bought and I’ll never go back to another. One charge lasts more than a week and I never turn mine off",2022,04
I was using it for my laptop that I use for work and school and the mouse stop working in week!! Horrible!,2022,04
The mouse doesn't work now and I am outside the return window. Disappointed beasue i like the feel of the mouse and the sleek design,2022,04
I love this mouse. It works perfectly and I’m not all that tech savvy,2022,04
"Love the sleep mode, keep my mouse charged when I forget to turn it off.",2022,04
Stopped working 5 days after the 30-day cutoff for returns. It worked great while I could use it but of course this is unacceptable. I won't buy from this seller again.,2022,04
"I use it for work! And it’s amazing, glides very nice! I am sure it would be perfect for gaming!",2022,04
Great service fast delivery I got this for my new Laptop I Like it I didnt know that it chages colors I thought that was pretty cool ! when you turn mouse over on the bottom theres a spot where it turns on or off and a picture of a sun and that changes the color of the mouse that is nice Just got this the other day to match my Laptop as its pink rose color and I Love it  it slim and doesnot hurt my fingers when scrollig which I like,2022,04
like it a lot,2022,04
Wanted to match my keyboard and not spend too much money.  This little number is priced just right and the size and shape make it easy to use.,2022,04
 Ive had for about a year and only used it on occasion. It worked pretty good until I started using it on a regular basis. Mouse slowly stopped working more and more until now it doesn’t track any movement at all. Do not buy unless you want to throw away,2022,04
It broke from one say to the next . Sad cause it was cute and very handy but the product just didn’t last long at all.,2022,04
Fun and great to use.,2022,04
It fits my hand and the light show is cool.,2022,04
"battery charge lasts many, many days",2022,04
I don’t like using my mouse on my laptop so having a mouse is helpful. And then it lights up!!,2022,04
I bought this mouse 6 months ago.  I use it CONSTANTLY and have yet to charge it.  For the price point? Steal!,2022,04
"I have been using this with my work laptop, which I use 8-9 hours daily for remote work. I’ve had this for a few weeks and only needed to charge once since then. I really love the feel of it, it’s a near silent and very soft click sound when using buttons. I like the look of it and the lights, so I know when it’s in sleep mode. Turns on and immediately works with one click. Completely operational when plugged in to charge as well. The charge cord is very short but I plugged into the laptop to charge it and it was long enough for me to use it right next to the USB port it was plugged into without being a nuisance. I would love for there to be a way to see the battery life on the mouse, it’s the only thing I would change/add.Very pleased and hope it lasts a long while!Update:This mouse is still going strong, still love it. I use it daily for work, 8+ a day, 5 days a week. Still love the lights lol.My one and ONLY complaint - I wish we could see the battery life of the mouse. I have been charging one every couple of weeks just to be safe (I hate the laptop mouse). It does work when plugged in and charging, tho, so that is nice, I just prefer wireless. Im not knocking off stars due to this at all, just offering a suggestion to somehow let us see the battery life remaining!",2022,04
"Very DISAPPOINTED . . . I bought this for my Kindergarten classroom and the kids loved it.  Last week it totally went black.  No more cool lights . . . No more nothing.  After 7 months, it does not work.  BEWARE if you want to use if for a long period of time.  :(",2022,04
"Bought this to use at work and I absolutely love it! Not only are the changing colorful lights pretty cool, it works really well. However, the best part about this mouse is that it is RECHARGEABLE! Bye, bye batteries!",2022,04
It worked fine until it quit one day. I can't really complain because of the price but I'm going to to try something else to replace it.,2022,04
"Would buy again for $10 if I really needed a mouse. It is not that nice however, it does function so. Cannot really complain. Wouldn't try gaming with it.",2022,04
This thing became erratic after about a month.  I've tried all the fixes I found online and nothing works.,2022,04
This mouse died 6 months after I got it and it spent most of it's time turned off inside a laptop bag.,2022,04
"Fits the hand, charge lasts, however the cord that comes with it could be more sturdy.",2022,04
"Junk.... Charged it and used it several times.... It worked for about a handful of times, charged again. The light on the switch flashes but turns off immediately so that it won't go on even though it is charged. Save your money and by a well known brand",2022,04
Seamless connectivity to my pc,2022,04
…..Chinese junk. Lasted 1 month,2022,04
This mouse is great!,2022,04
"I made the mistake of reading the reviews only after I bought the mouse, because it had 4.5 stars with something like 30,000 reviews so I thought it was fine. I saw a few reviews that said the seller tried to bribe them into removing their review! That made me really regret buying from such an unethical business. I don't think you should buy this mouse even if you're on a budget - there's much better quality mice out there for even less money than this costs.This mouse is very cheaply made. As for performance issues:For one, it's way too thin and lightweight - When using it, it's very easy to knock it out of place and click something by mistake because it's not heavy enough (or grippy enough on the bottom) to stay where you put it. I've never had this issue with a mouse before. The tracking sensor is also way too sensitive - the cursor still moves when you lift the mouse a decent couple centimeters above the surface it's on. This also makes it very hard to put the cursor where you want it on the screen because it's still tracking movement when you lift it up.The cord to charge it is pretty short - although that's not a huge issue, just sort of disappointing. The biggest issue is that the cord does not seem to fit properly into the port on the mouse and takes a bit of manhandling. It felt like I was going to break some of the cheap, thin plastic when I first plugged it in.As for looks:The edges where the ""paint"" or whatever it is on the top are pretty rough, and it even came with some of the paint chipped off. I bought the light pink mouse. It's not nearly as light as it is in the pictures. It's darker and much warmer toned rather than a cool light pink like the picture. It's also not as reflective as the pictures show but that's not a huge deal. You can turn off the RGB lights by the switch on the bottom if you want, but it still emits a red light when using it. I wish it didn't do that - it's ugly and probably wastes more power.",2022,04
Using this mouse for my Dell laptop. Works great!,2022,04
smoothe,2022,04
Very cheaply made. Another you get what you pay for. Suggest you pass.,2022,04
I've bought 2 of these mouses. When the first one broke I thought it might just have been a dud. I really liked the mouse up until that point so I decided to get another one. It's been 6 weeks and the same issues. With both mouses the scroll button broke. While the mouse does still 'technically' work it's super inconvenient and annoying.,2022,04
The mouse is really pretty but the battery life is super short. It doesn't even last my 8hr workday after a full charge :(,2022,04
"When I first got the item the color looked off. I ordered the Blue but I'm fairly positive based on the images I was sent Mint Green. I liked the quiet button clicks and it was nice to have in college classes for a bit because it was so quiet. However, after only a week and a half, the mouse wheel stopped working. I could feel the tension in the wheel was gone so I opened it to investigate and it looked like there was a small plastic rod that rotated with the wheel but the contact point between the rod and wheel was broken so it wouldn't work anymore. I liked the aesthetics of it except for the red led used for the tracking would also overpower the RGB lights. It bothered me but that didn't affect the function. I wish this had worked better.",2022,04
Just wouldn’t connect. Plugged it in and was fully charged. Just didn’t work,2022,04
Worked good for the first 2 months. Used the mouse on a security camera hard drive to review camera footage. Worked fine one time and after that no “cursor “ icon appeared. Tried plugging it back into my desktop and still no cursor icon available. It won’t select anything. Only right click works but can’t scroll to a selection. Luckily my desktop is touch screen so I manually opened up the drives properties and it’s said that All device functions are working properly. Clearly not being able to see a cursor is an issue 🥴,2022,04
"I’ve had this mouse for less than three months now, thought it looked really cool at first. No longer works at all and I’m stuck without a mouse again for my laptop.",2022,04
"Bought in January, it's April and it won't charge so it's useless.",2022,04
wheek scroll was brock,2022,04
"I loved this mouse -- for all of one month. It connected and worked perfectly. However, after one month of relatively light use, the scrolling wheel stopped working. Of course this happened right after the return window closed! Now I'm back to square one.",2022,04
The wheel on this mouse if very flimsy. It has failed on two of the 3 devices I ordered. I would not recommend this product. It's not even suitable for the lightest of duties.,2022,04
"Nice mouse, portable, works great, silent. I like the changing colors",2022,04
"Easy to set up, like that it is rechargeable and don't need batteries.",2022,04
I initially Liked this mouse but after a month it stopped working. Terrible product. Waste of money,2022,04
"I've only had this for a few months, but not only is it really cool looking, it's responsive and comfortable to use.",2022,04
"Perfect mouse for a laptop. I've been using it for a little over 2 months, usually for a few hours everyday and haven't changed to batteries yet. The only ""problem"" I have is I love watching the colors change so much I start to zone out on my work time! Very relaxing.",2022,04
not good,2022,04
"I love how quiet it was without hearing clicking at every move, but unfortunately, it started stalling,freezing and just unusable in less than a month.",2022,04
"Got it for my grandson, for school his chrome book.",2022,04
"This mouse is clunky as it would at times not connect. However, I ordered it in March and now in April, the mouse no longer works… do lot but!!",2022,04
Cool product for kid if the scrolling wheel in middle doesn’t keep breaking.,2022,04
"I got this in the mint green color, and I like that color. The only issue is that it broke in about a month, so if you really need a mouse for your laptop, but if you want a cheap one, then I don't really recommend this product.",2022,04
Great buy,2022,04
"I got this mouse on thursday night. I only charged it for less than 20 minutes (not a full charge) and have been using it for 5 days in a row on the red-light mode only. I thought it would run out of power in a day or two but is still working nicely. The mouse feels comfortable under my palm, not too big or too small. I was ready to be disappointed for the price vs. quality, but so far so good.",2022,04
No complaint.  Great product,2022,04
I like the color and the changing light. The sleep mode is nice and saves battery life when you are not moving the mouse.,2022,04
"Fits my hand perfectly, the color changing lights are a fun addition to every day boring mundane task! The black mouse is sleek and soft! I LOVE IT",2022,04
"Very nice mouse. It's super quiet! Exactly what I wanted. The lights are nice and change on their own. I haven't had to charge it yet, but it gets a ton of time off the initial charge.",2022,04
The scroll wheel broke in the exact same way twice in the last 4 months. We opened the mouse up and it's not a simple fix so the first time we replaced it but this time we're just going with a different brand,2022,04
"When I bought this mouse I loved it. It took me a few tries to get it paired right, but it is a game changer for my laptop. The rechargeable battery life on it is great. I found that if the mouse stopped responding quickly, that it was time to charge it.I purchased it late September and at the end of April my roller has stopped working randomly. It worked and then I went to use it an hour later and it no longer does. The scrolling wheel is an essential feature for me with my laptop. I'm disappointed.",2022,04
"product works as advertised. no issues. until the wheel simply stopped working one day, about 6 months in. you don’t realize how much you use said wheel until um you don’t have that function anymore. otherwise, great product.",2022,04
I got a white one and the LEDs shine thru the plastic. The pointer tracking laser noticeably strobes. I will get something better made,2022,04
A very nice upgrade and replacement mouse with no cords and no batteries. Perfect!,2022,04
This mouse is ok except for the battery life. It didn’t make it through a full 8hr day of work before shutting off and needing to be charged again.,2022,04
"I would not recommend this mouse to anyone. No right click available on the mouse - does not work.  Fell apart already. It is very difficult to ""click"".  The only plus is that it's a pretty color!  Does not work!!!!! Very poor quality.",2022,04
I’ve gone through 3 or 4 of these in less than a year. They are not durable in my teenagers hands. I’m sure they are not the most gentle with them  either. I buy them because they are cheap and we just need to get through the school year. I have switched brands recently to see if it’s them or this brand that just breaks. It’s always the scrollers that break.,2022,04
After the first use the mouse no longer holds a charge!,2022,04
"This mouse works as advertised. The changing lights on the side of it are what drew me in when browsing for a new mouse on Amazon. I don't really like the slim feel to it, I feel like my hand would get tired after using it for extended periods of time. I also was looking for specifically a USB-C mouse, and to make this one work with USB C you have to use the included adapter, which ends up sticking out quite a ways on the edge of your computer. This is clearly stated in the advertisement, I just didn't pay enough attention when I bought the mouse.",2022,04
"The price of this mouse was cheap, and you will get just that with this product. It serves its purpose OK. I like the color changing LED lights. But this mouse is too lightweight for my liking, and my hand is too big to fit on the mouse comfortably. It feels like there is a lag when moving the arrow, just an overall not great feel compared to my mouse on my work/office computer.",2022,04
Mouse stopped working after 3 months.,2022,04
Totally stopped working after 3 months.only a 30 day refund policy.,2022,04
I liked the mouse until the USB C to USB dongle broke it is way to long on a moving laptop,2022,04
Stopped working in 29 days,2022,03
Fast charger and beautiful design!!,2022,04
Easy to use,2022,04
Only got to use it for a month and then after that I tried to charge it and but it didn't charge and didn't work. Not worth getting it. Doesn't last long.,2022,04
"I loved this mouse when I first got it. It moves nicely and the colors around the base is awesome. I could tell it was cheaply made, but didn't think more of it. Just went to use it now and the scroller in the middle is busted. It rotates, but it doesn't do anything on my computer.",2022,04
"Literally from the box it won't light up or download the software to be able to use. My mouse won't move and it says ""compatible with mac"" that is absolutely untrue. Can you explain to me why that's stated in the description? It's the only reason I purchased this and it doesn't work. Disappointed.",2022,04
2nd one I bought,2022,04
smol,2022,04
Don’t buy this bought it twice and it broke down quickly! Very cheap product,2022,04
"I like that this mouse os sleek in design has a long battery life, and is easy to set up. I often forget to turn it off but that doesn't matter because it goes into a sleep mode to preserve battery. The only concern My tablet has a C type so the converter is helpful. The only thing that I would change is that the converter doesn't fit inside the mouse for storage so you have to be careful not to lose it if you detach it from the tablet.",2022,04
The scroll ball thing broke and doesn’t work after a month of very light usage. I would definitely not recommend purchasing this mouse.,2022,04
At first it worked perfectly fine. Then I notice the movements on my PC screen became slow and laggy. Then it finally did. Waste of time and money.,2022,04
Nice sleek design however does not hold the charge for long. It’s frustrating when the computer is turned on and it doesn’t come on after switching it on.,2022,04
"It worked great. I liked the low profile.  However, it started to act up a few days before and then stopped working after 5 months.  I tried it on two laptops with the same results.",2022,04
Stop working in 2 weeks,2022,04
"I get so many compliments about this mouse. I move location to location for my job and it’s held up just fine. Quiet click, smooth functionality, fun color changing LED… I love it! The only negative is that the charging cord is short and doesn’t also operate the mouse when plugged in, so make sure you have two USB plugs when needing a charge.",2022,04
"The mouse does not work without a mousepad. As such, I’m going to return this product",2022,04
"I had the mouse working for one day, then I could not use it any further. The mouse pointer had a mind of it's own and would take over it's own movement. What a disappointment! I was hoping not to go back to battery operated mouse.I say do not buy this product!!!",2022,04
was working fine then surly the clicker in the middle stoped working,2022,04
"Purchased this in September 2021, worked great until April 2022, then completely died! Won’t charge or turn on. Doesn’t work anymore. Got 7 good months from it! Won’t be buying another one.",2022,04
Failed after three month of use(from Jan 17 2022 to Apr 21 2022).Charging is not possible.It is too late to exchange.Do not waste a money.,2022,04
It’s good for in the go only thing is I have bad wrists and it isn’t 100% ergo for me.,2022,04
"Used this for work and it’s perfect. Quick and responsive, cute appearance, and very light. Battery life last a good amount of time before requiring charge. Love the lights!",2022,04
"Liked this little mouse.  It holds a charge but after 2 months it no longer works.  Even after fully charging the right mouse button will work so i know it is connected.  Uninstalled the device, rebooted the laptop and nothing fixed the issue.",2022,04
The USB C adapter is ill fitting and won't keep charging the mouse unless it is held and tilted just so.  Luckily I have another adapter and that is working fine so the mouse itself is good.,2022,04
Had a issue and they made up for it. Not sure why it stopped working but they are sending a new one.,2022,04
I only used it for a week and the scroller stopped working,2022,04
"I have had this mouse for almost 2 months, and I use it at least 12 hours a day. I haven't been paying close enough attention to amount of hours until it needs charging, but in the time I have had it I have only had to charge it 3 times, and I was able to continue to use it while charging.I do use it for gaming, but my games don't require fast and accurate like RPG's etc..so I can say yes, it does gaming for me, but I'm unsure about speed games.Pros:*It's slim and long so it feels good in my hand even though it's not ""ergonomically"" built, and it fits nicely in my carry case.*The colors are soothing*You have options for either standard USB or USB-C for chargingThe Cons:*The on/off button is teeny weeny and sits flush with the hole. you need nails or a stylus to turn it on*The sensor underneath sometimes has issues with the mouse pad and it ""skates"" over the pad. A good shake usually gets it right.All in all, it's priced reasonably for what you get.**update: like everyone else, just a few days past the 30 day return cutoff my mouse also died. No power, wouldn't charge.. dead. I contacted the Manufacturer MOTOTO INC and they said they have a 1 year warranty on this mouse and they would be happy to send out a new one.",2022,04
Works perfectly for work computer,2022,04
Worth it,2022,03
I bought two of them. We didn't use them every day but they both broke after 3 months.It is a waste of money and you should not buy them.,2022,04
I would give it no stars if I could.,2022,04
nice that you can carry with you the mouse along with its USB key,2022,04
The scroll wheel broke after 2 months. I have food in my fridge that’s lasted longer. Not worth it.,2022,04
This item shuts off and on while you’re using it. I have to smack it onto my desk to get it to wake up. Piece of junk,2022,04
"OMG! I LOVE this mouse!! It works great with my laptop! I just plug in the little key into the USB port and hello!I REALLY like that it's rechargeable, so saving a ton on batteries. I can't use it while it charging though.The clicks are very quiet, so I don't annoy even myself with the noise. And I love looking at it because of the colors added!! Of course, you can turn off the pulsing colors to save charge, but who would want to??? Unless you needed to...Also, it's a bit small, good for travel, and fits a woman's hand. If you're a man, this mouse may be a bit too small even if it looks cool for gaming.As much as I use my HP laptop, this mouse is a must!Christa",2022,04
NO battery life!!!,2022,04
It broke within 3 days of having this mouse. I accidentally dropped it as I was picking up the mouse and my computer. It cannot sustain a fall from less than 2 feet. Definitely did enjoy it for the 3 days I had it.,2022,04
its a cool mouse till i had to recharge it plugged in the cable that came with it and it started getting hot until i saw smoke ripped it out almost burned my self regular phone charger works fine tho...,2022,04
I love this mouse. Its slim and fits perfectly in my hand! Highly recommend for daily use,2022,04
My mouse worked for 2 months and on the third month it wasn't scrolling anymore and the mouse itself was just falling apart. Don't spend you money on this item.,2022,04
"I just received this product today and even though there were numerous good reviews, I unfortunately cannot leave a positive one due to the fact that this is useless due to a non functional OTG plug.",2022,04
Needed a wifi mouse for my HP Chromebook. I liked the fun lights and the price was good. Set up was quick and easy via bluetooth. Works great.,2022,04
The roller stopped working,2022,04
"I bought a different one of these in the fall and it worked for a short time. I thought I was buying from a different company this time, but this mouse also has failed me. DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE! I charged it and still, nothing.",2022,04
I charged the mouse for over 6 hours and never even charged. it doesn't even work. turn it on and it blinks red. I have already started a return. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!,2022,04
I needed a new mouse for work. I didn't want to deal with batteries and this is exactly what I was looking for. It's a light and smooth.,2022,04
The wheel is already broken. I only use it for office use and I bought it about a month ago. Very disappointed.,2022,04
"Started out great but after about 3 weeks and when the return window closed will not hold a charge. It’s charging when the blue light is on … only stays on for 30 second after plugging in. If there were 0 stars I would give it that, I didn’t even have enough time to really use it only got about 5 uses before it wouldn’t charge.",2022,04
slik . nice color. same as photos . I love it also its actually wireless and no need battery. (some still one AAA battery even if its says wirless) . bought so many of this to my whole family,2022,04
We tried and have hard time trying to connect then it disconnects/no light/power for the MacBook. So don’t use this for any apple devices it does it should work but gives hard time get frustrated. Better for those other computers/laptop,2022,04
Regular use,2022,04
"Absolute garbage. Listen to the negative reviews and the ones saying the company is spamming them begging to remove their posts. The lights are haywire with no pattern, randomly switching off and on. DPI is NOT adjustable, pretty sure that's a lie. Feels like the lowest grade plastic I've ever felt. Does not track. Lights will give you a seizure. Without a doubt this company is scamming you.",2022,04
"Great mouse, I like the colors and how easy it was to connect to my laptop and Tablet so I can play Baldurs Gate on my tablet way easier now. Charging doesn't take long at all either. Some with large hands may not like it to much it is a bit smaller",2022,04
When it worked it was good.  Now it no longer connects to the dongle or stays on.  I’ve made sure it is charged both through a wall outlet and USB port.,2022,04
I just got this not very long ago. It just stopped tracking on the page and just out right quit! It is a piece of junk to me and I would never buy this again.I am not happy and wasted my money on this.,2022,04
Very slim. Stays charged for a long time,2022,04
"When this gets low on battery, it starts to ""flicker"" out where the mouse will stop and start sending information. So your clicks won't register and the mouse will stop moving across the screen.The added problem is that it gets to this low battery point after about 45min to an hour of use, and then it acts like that for the next several hours. It's nearly impossible to keep it charged up that long.It's a shame because I love how stylized it is. But it's basically unusable.",2022,04
"Tried this product on three different computers, could not get the unit to work on any of them.  Charged as per the instructions, and using the USB, the driver was found.  However, the unit would not operate at all.",2022,04
This mouse is sleek and has a great feel. It doesn't require batteries so it is a great mouse to have. The LED light is an added bonus.,2022,04
Given to wife as a gift. She loves it.,2022,04
Serves its purpose for everyday use. I’m a teacher who uses their laptop daily. Worked great for about 4 months and then the middle wheel stopped working.,2022,04
after only 2 months it will no longer hold a charge,2022,04
The wireless connection works great and mouse looks sleek and cool. Especially for the price.,2022,04
Mouse works fine and the grandkids love them. They mainly use them for school work and for gaming.,2022,04
"Have used this mouse for more than a month now. The cursor jumps around unreliably on the screen, making it difficult to navigate. Battery life is not very long before needs recharging. Feels very cheaply made in hand. Do not recommend.",2022,04
"Battery inside the mouse is it not recharable. It’s not working after battery life gone. So after 3 months of usage it’s not working. I try to change the battery but it’s very difficult to change battery. Need to open the top cover and removing batter is not easy. Even After I changed the battery also, it not working. It’s looks like one time use only.",2022,04
I bought this mouse in November 2021 and it just died (April 2022). I used this for working 40 hours a week and I even took 6 weeks of for maternity and wasn’t using this mouse. So really this mouse only lasted 4 months. The USB Bluetooth that plugs into the computer died. The mouse will still light up when I turn it Off and on but then doesn’t do anything after that. It was a great mouse while it worked though! I guess I shouldn’t be upset with this mouse compared to the price. You get what you pay for!,2022,04
"This product stopped working for me after two days, it was fine but now it no longer charges and doesn’t even work while it’s plugged in.",2022,04
My son loves his gaming mouse,2022,04
"DO NOT BUY IT!!!  This mouse stopped working. They built it enough to last a few months so it's out of amazon's return policy... After that, it doesn't work!",2022,04
Careful. It's not bluetooth. I had to order my daughter a new one an I kept this one for myself.,2022,04
"Sleep mode turns on too fast for me, however I really enjoy the mouse overall - just use for work/travel, not gaming.",2022,04
"Love how it looks when it changes colors, comes with adapter/charging cord and live the fact that it is rechargeable and the price was amazing",2022,04
Shipping took a long time. If you are wanting a mouse quickly buy some place else. THEN it stopped working after 2 months. Stay away.,2022,04
"Stoped working since the first day ,doesn’t hold the charge and gets disconnected , I have to turn it on and off a few times in order to connect it again to the computer , I don’t recommend to by this product .",2022,04
Mine is not working after a month of use,2022,04
I bought this brand for the conveniance of using adapter provided with the product for USB-C. The adapter is so loose it falls off. Tried in 3 different computers that has USB-CSame problem.I have 30 days to return. Let me check how long the battery holds good before charge.,2022,04
Cute color and lights.Works great.,2022,04
Loved the mouse until the scroll wheel stopped working.  Opened it up and the wheel has broken. Always used with care. I wouldn't suggest buying if you're a gamer or need to do a lot of scrolling.,2022,04
"It was a nice, quiet mouse but about 6 months in, I've had issues charging with different and the original charging cord. The charge does not last very long either. I really wanted to like this but I will be getting a new mouse. I only use this for work as I work remote.",2022,04
I love this mouse. It is sleek and fits perfectly in the palm of my hand. I love that it lights up beautiful colors. It is rechargeable so you don’t have to worry about finding batteries. Best purchase I made. I highly recommend this mouse.,2022,04
"I’ve enjoyed this mouse for the most part, it’s everything it mentions in the description. However my scroll wheel just randomly broke after only a month of using. I purchased the mouse for work purposes and the scroll literally broke during a project.",2022,04
"Just received a replacement mouse, as the first one stopped working after a few months.  I really like this mouse.  It glides smoothly and without time delay.  I used this strictly for basic internet and office work, not gaming.  It's also visually attractive with changing color lights.  This has a great 1-year warranty which covers defects/problems.  Very pleased so far.",2022,04
Stopped working after 3 months,2022,04
"I have had 2 of these. The first mouse I ordered worked fine until the mouse just felt loose and didn’t respond. I was able to get a replacement and was satisfied. The replacement did the same thing. I got it in Jan and today the scroll wheel just felt loose and didn’t respond. Waste of money, do not recommend.",2022,04
Failed to work in 3 months,2022,04
Its cute but it didn't work for my Microsoft labtop.,2022,04
"This piece of junk must have a program to discontinue working 3 days after the return date YOU put on it of March 31, 2022!battery will not hold a charge.I guess I will go back to buying from Costco they give 90 days return on electronics",2022,04
Looks beautiful but I couldn’t get it to sink to my 2021 MacBook Air. Saddened,2022,04
"I just love this, the lights are awesome….going to buy more",2022,04
My mouse stopped working within two weeks. Waste of money :(,2022,04
"Its a nice mouse, good size but the scrolling wheel doesn't roll anymore, I've only had it for a month and it broke.",2022,04
"Normal daily use for a few weeks. Scroller suddenly caved in today and stopped working. Positive reviews must be from people who haven’t owned it for long, or mine was just damaged during shipping. Nevertheless, I honestly didn’t know computer mice could even break. Returning.",2022,04
I bought this for working at home/general use. I was sick of my old mouse running out of batteries when I didn't have any. Works great for general use and battery lasts a while but I haven't done any button mashing games with it. My only complaint is the USB remote plugin fits tight into the underside for storage. You have to dig with your nail to remove it. Small infrequent task but for me if it was corrected its an ideal computer mouse.,2022,04
"Really liked this mouse for the first week. It then became pretty useless. Tried to recharge, reinstall and all the other hacks. Still won’t accurately track worth beans. Off to the donation pile. Can’t recommend",2022,04
"When I got it, I was excited for the USB charging and the cool lights, but this mouse has been a lot of trouble. It will lose connection easily and I'll have to click 4 or 5 times sometimes before actually clicking on what I want.",2022,04
"Okay, so, I cannot answer honestly about the gaming capabilities of this mouse. My husband is the gamer. I can however, let you know about my general usage opinion...First off, it's pretty. I love the color and I love that it lights up on the sides. There is a setting on the back that allows you to turn off the lights to save battery drain. I've been using it for 4 days, pretty consistently and haven't needed to charge it.There wasn't any software or drivers that needed to be installed in order for it to be used. I just plugged in the small USB and it immediately worked.That's all I can say at this point since I haven't had it that long. I will update this review in a few months and include any issues I may experience and any new opinions I develop...",2022,04
"I bought this on October 29, 2021 and it stopped working on April 6, 2022. It started acting up on the 5th where the responsiveness was sketchy. I charged it that night and the next day it didn’t power up.",2022,04
It only worked for 6 months and then it died. I have used different mouses before for years  and I have never experienced moused died until this one died.,2022,04
" If you have big hands, I don’t recommend you buying this. Also with the lighting I really dislike it! If you look at the video it goes through the mouse and you can see all the the stuff inside! Very disappointed. Overall, it’s a good and sturdy mouse, just thought they could’ve worked on the exterior more.",2022,04
"I'm a teacher so I don't want to be attached to my computer at the front the whole day. This mouse keeps a good charge, allows me to walk around my class the whole time- stays attached to me, & the colors just add a bit of fun to it.",2022,04
I really like this mouse. It's perfect size and I love that it charges. Holds the charge for a long time.,2022,04
"It is exactly as depicted.  My old mouse just wasn't working correctly, even with a new battery, I was banging on it to get it to respond.  This one is just as advertised, changes colors and responds on just a slight touch.  I LOVE IT !",2022,04
"I like the shape and the way the mouse works, unfortunately, I can't even make it through a whole day of work without it needing to be charged again.",2022,04
I use it for working at home and it gets the job done for the cost. It's not extravagant but it does what I need it to do. I would recommend it!,2022,04
Easy to use  and light,2022,04
No dislikes,2022,04
I like everything about it,2022,04
It worked well for a couple of weeks but now there is a significant lag between where I move the mouse and where it actually goes. Do not waste your money.,2022,04
"THE SCROLLING FEATURE STOPPED BY APRIL 5,2022. THE MOUSE WILL NOT SCROLL A PAGE USING THE SCROLL BUTTON ON TOP OF THE MOUSE. NOT GOOD!!",2022,04
"I loved this mouse--it is super lightweight and the color is lovely. Sometimes I would forget to charge it after a week/week and a half, so that was on me to try to remember. But just yesterday, it stopped charging. Usually the light turns blue when it's charging, which is a great indicator, so I left it overnight to charge while plugged into my laptop. This morning when I tried to use the mouse, it didn't work. I thought maybe I hadn't plugged it in properly, but just now when I plugged it in (tested out several different USB ports on my laptop), the blue charging indicator light flickered for a second and then went out. It seems that this mouse is not charging anymore, making it basically useless. :(",2022,04
I like the sleek feeling and the multi-colour while in use and very very soft clicks💜💜💜,2022,04
"Good product, awesome price",2022,04
"I like the feel and look of this mouse. I bought it as a deal of the day. I really like how it changes colors and how smooth it feels. I also love that you can recharge it. Only dislike is that I review and edit important documents for work and sometimes the cursor would move unexpectedly and will cause me to type something I wasn't trying to type. I'll have to  undo whatever I did. Other than that, good price and quality!",2022,04
"This mouse worked just long enough for me not to be able to return it.  Not sure what went wrong, but it just gave out and that was it.",2022,04
Loved the change of lights and the fell under my hand. Great mouse.,2022,04
"Wheel stop working after a few months. Wouldn’t recommend, now unable to get a replacement mouse since it’s outside of the return window.",2022,04
This mouse is junk. The battery charge does not last. It is rechargeable but you can't use your computer while it is charging.,2022,04
This mouse is so slick and smooth. It is very quiet with the clicking. Love it!!,2022,04
Nunca funciono,2022,04
"Loved at first. Very cute, loved the scrolling and clicking. Bought for work and used for a couple of weeks and noticed my thumb hurting a lot. Felt like I pulled something in it. Noticed it was worse when using the mouse. Switched to my old mouse that is ergonomic and my thumb is improving. If it’s for minimal use it’s probably ok, but definitely not for daily use at the office",2022,04
"This is for doing school work and casual browsing. Being a gamer, I wouldn't use this for gaming for anyone who is asking, but as a standard wireless mouse it works great with no concerns as of yet. I like that you don't have to replace disposable batteries and it charges quickly via a charging cable that comes with the mouse, as well as instructions (you won't need them as it's very simple to figure it all out). The color changing lights are a nice touch that my 9 year old loves. Would strongly recommend, especially for the price. I enjoy the product so far, especially for school work and internet browsing.",2022,04
"I use this mouse for my laptop only when I travel.  After about 3 times using it, the scroll no longer works even when completely charged.  unfortunately with such little use I didn't have much time to notice the defect and the return window has closed.  Wouldn't recommend it.",2022,04
"I get it as a spear mouse, so I didn’t start using it when I get it. It only worked for one day. I didn’t drop it or anything it just stop working.Update: the seller reach out to me after seeing this review and agree to refund for the purchase.",2022,04
Too much bother to charge when at the office cannot leave on my desk for fears of loosing it,2022,04
"As with several other reviews here, the one I purchased lasted several months, until it just stopped tracking mid-swipe.  I thought maybe it just needed a recharge, as that's what it has done in the past when I forgot to charge it overnight... but no, it's more like it just shorted out... works for a swipe and a click and then stops again. Kinda sucks because it's a really cool and fun mouse with the LED lights and the charging vs. batteries. I guess I'll look now to see if the warranty will help a girl out...",2022,04
"I have only used this a shirt time, it's alright, it does take a minute to get used to the low profile.  My biggest complaint is that it didn't come with a charger as stated.  I now have to find a charger that will fit, or spend more money to purchase a charger just to ensure I can recharge it.",2022,04
First one broke immediately - same day! For another one sent as replacement and that broke in 3 days. Garbage . Do not buy.,2022,03
I’ve had the mouse for about a month and it works great. I use it everyday M-F for work (8+ hours) and I’ve only have had to charge it once after the initial charge. I recommend for sure.,2022,03
"Unfortunately I missed the return window by less than a month - I do a lot of panning around for my work with the middle scroll wheel button, and the button has issues about half the time where it doesn't register that I clicked or gets stuck. It's cute, but I wouldn't buy it again.Update:Just wrote this review a couple days ago, the scroll wheel just broke fully, no more intermittent use. I use it a lot, but I bought it literally two months ago.",2022,03
I love this mouse! It matches the decor in my home office perfectly!,2022,03
"I purchased this mouse on March 18, 2022. All of sudden the mouse just don't want to move in the directions I need it to!!! Each time I move the mouse to different templates or screens it move, then pause, then move a little, and pause again. I would not recommend the mouse to anyone. Worst mouse I've ever purchased.",2022,03
"The fact that it has a quiet mechanism -no sound whatsoever during clicking- was great. But even though I only used it for my desktop computer at work (4-5 days a week), it is not working right now! I did not carry it around or used it for more than a hour during each day, basically because I use my laptop most of time. 10 months is a pretty premature time frame to not function.",2022,03
Very cheap quality.The lights don't look like the photo. It just changes from one color to another and never looks rainbow like in the photos.Also buttons are not silent.,2022,03
It’s okay not quiet at all,2022,03
Used for my MAC Latop,2022,03
"I could not rate the other categories (ergonomics, sleep mode or gaming) because it never worked!Wish I had paid more attention to the 1star reviews😡Unfortunately I missed the return by date.Wish I had paid more attention to the 1star reviews😡DO NOT BUY!!!",2022,03
I use my mouse pretty so often and it’s lasted about 3 weeks before I had to charge it!,2022,03
I like that this cute mouse holds charge for days and is rechargeable. No more batteries dying on me.,2022,03
I really like this mouse.  It works great and is really cool looking.  I love the alternating color lights around it and since it's rechargeable you don't have to worry about a short battery life.  I work on my computer 40+ hours a week and I find I only need to charge it every 2-3 weeks.  So periodically I just plug it into my laptop when I go to sleep so it is always good to go.,2022,03
The scroll wheel stopped working right after the return window closed so I can't even return it...,2022,03
Sadly the roller ball stopped working 😒,2022,03
Smooth Glide,2022,03
"Did not function, even after charging and plugging it in.  Returned.",2022,03
This mouse looked nice and felt comfortable but the usb-c adapter did not fit so I had to return it,2022,03
Really cute mouse but only used it once and now it wont even turn on.,2022,03
I have been using this mouse for 5-6 weeks now and I have no complaints! It goes to sleep on its own and comes back on easily with a click. No delays or problems connecting to Bluetooth! I do wish I had a way to know what the battery life was but I just hook it up every 3-4 days and it hasn’t died on me yet!,2022,03
I absolutely love this mouse. It's well built and has so many features that similarly priced mice don't have. It's so whisper quiet and smooth as can be. It's also rechargable which helps out a ton.,2022,03
The mouse scrolled only worked for one day then stopped. Everything else works and lights are very pretty,2022,03
I love this so much. I’m so happy with this that I order two.,2022,03
Didn’t last.  Worked for a short while!  I guess you get what you pay for! 🤬,2022,03
"I absolutely loved this mouse. It worked great, the battery lasted for days, and it fit my hand so well. I'm only giving it a low rating because after a month and three days, it quit working. It will not turn on anymore.",2022,03
Straight out of the box the left click button doesn’t work. Completely useless. Sending back. Don’t waste your time like I have.,2022,03
"I haven’t had it long and it just stop working. It’s not in sleep mode, It also says that the port has used all it space for the usb.",2022,03
"It last a long time ( I charge it maybe every 3-4days ) maybe once a week; I go to school 3 times a week and I’m in nursing school so a lot of homework, just purchased but it’s already making a noise when I scroll up or down. :/",2022,03
"I love it silently clicks, automatically goes to sleep conserving battery and slick design",2022,03
"I really want to like this mouse even more than I do... the colors are cute, but it has a flicker that just goes consistently. I wish I could continue to use this but I think I am going to have to get something else. The flicker drives me nuts. I charged it fully and there is no reason it should not work when I just got it today. it would also be nice if the charge cord was long enough that you could use it while it was charging.",2022,03
Came like this. I tried popping it back in but it keeps on popping back out. Wouldn't recommend.,2022,03
"Returned since it was missing the USB-C adapter, this is the only reason why I purchased it since I needed USB port for my flashdrive.",2022,03
It Works Excellent. It is very awesome,2022,03
The usb dongle broke for the mouse and is now completely useless. I wish the seller sold replacements so I can use my mouse again!,2022,03
"I only used this mouse a few times, and the wheel scroll broke after 2 months; would other wise be 5/5 stars",2022,03
" Was hoping for a light weight mouse to use with my laptop. Instead I seem to have purchased a red dead mouse. The only color it has is red, and it doesn't function at all besides a weak light. Not impressed.",2022,03
Its perfect,2022,03
"This mouse does not work with my new mac air 13.  I switched to my hp computer and it started to work periodically with it but now has stopped.  I strongly recommend not purchasing this mouse.  To say the least, it is unreliable.",2022,03
"This mouse is very sheek and I love it because the clicker is quiet. However, its a bit flat and take some getting use to.",2022,03
"Directions suck, charger sucks, pretty color",2022,03
"Worked great at first.  After about a month the sensor stopped working.  Too late to exchange or return now.  I use this for work.  Might be worth it to invest in something of better quality.  Looks nice, that’s about it.",2022,03
"The mouse is comfortable to use. I notice while using it there is a bit of lag. I would recommend if the slim design is what you are looking for. I would not recommend for gaming, I use it for work.",2022,03
Just as advertised.,2022,03
Use at work works great,2022,03
"Third different one I purchased like this because of all the positive reviews, can't believe them. Garbage right out of the box again, won't pair with the USB receiver & won't hold a battery charge. All done with these rechargeable garbage wireless mice.",2022,03
I bought this for my grandson to use with his Chromebook for school.  He is loving it.,2022,03
I have held back writing a review on this mouse based on some of the comments that it would die on them or it became unreliable after a while.  It has not been the case for me.  I have had it for several months now and it is very reliable and maintains all of its functions intact.  I would recommend the mouse.,2022,03
It’s goes on sleep more by it self so the battery last long.,2022,03
The connection from mouse to laptop isn’t constant. The sleep function is convenient but the mouse doesn’t have a good reaction time. I had to really press down on the left click for the mouse to do anything.,2022,03
"The scroller broke and I only used it about 3 times in total the rest of the time it sits in my bag. The lights are dim, I don't like how small it is. It does not have the best tracking, the clicking is louder than expected. It also just feels cheap. I would not buy it if I could do it again, go for a more quality one somewhere else.",2022,03
 At first I really liked this mouse! It was lightweight and had a sleek design. It ended there! Every time I go to use the mouse throughout the day I have to return it on even when it’s already in the on position. Anyone that is used to any other type of wireless mouse and you just use it anytime will quickly become annoyed with this mouse. The fact that you have to flip the switch on and off every time you go to use it makes it a poor choice!,2022,03
"The scroller broke after 7 weeks of intermittent use (approximately 8 hours per day, 3 days per week).",2022,03
Like how it fits in my hand but it kept stop working. Then after 2 months stopped all together. Do not get it,2022,03
 Love everything about this product. Like the setup and quick syncing to my monitor and system.,2022,03
"After a few months of use, obviously past the return window, the scroll wheel on the mouse does not track any scrolls and spins almost like a wheel on a skateboard. The LED’s also stopped working. If I were to purchase again, it would have to be considerably less with the frequency I’d have to buy them.",2022,03
The mouse worked great and then one afternoon as I was working the middle center stopped working. Couldn’t use it to scroll up and down anymore. Not even two months old and it’s not working.,2022,03
Great most for extended casual use.Love that I can recharge it AND use it at the same time so there's no down time or waisted batteries,2022,03
Love the simplicity of the design and overall product definitely would recommend.,2022,03
Works ok with just the standard USB dongle but we purchased to use with a Mac that only has a usb-c and it doesn’t work with the adapter. I contacted the company through email but they never responded.,2022,03
"After 3 months, it does not work any more.",2022,03
tracking,2022,03
The only adjustment I personally needed to make was learning to work the sleep mode and click the button to wake it back up. Other than that I love this mouse for work. The lights on it still work almost 2 months later with no issue the charge on the mouse plugs into a standard Micro USB cord and the mouse will hold charge with daily use for about 3-5 days. I usually just end the evening plugging in to a micro usb port and I am always good to go. grat buy and will replace with the same when the time comes.,2022,03
"nice size, fits the palm very nicely.  LED lightshow superfluous but i can live with it.  my old mouse went to mouseville, you know...the one down in tallahassee, FL !  LOL.  nice mouse for the buck.  could do worse.",2022,03
Stopped working after 4 uses. The scrolling wheel isn’t working.Update:I told the company about the issue with my mouse. They immediately sent a replacement. Works good lets see if this one lasts,2022,03
I can't get through the morning without this mouse losing its charge.  I would rather a battery!,2022,03
"This is cheap quality mouse.After  3 month of using, the rotating wheel broke. Now I can’t return it because it past the warranty.",2022,03
Color ..shape..size..weight everything is okay..but stopped working after few months..Update reviewThe seller has sent me a new mouse and this is working fine. I really appreciate the gesture.,2022,03
I've had my mouse for just over a month and the scroll tracker stopped working. Now I need to buy a new mouse.,2022,03
Worked good at first. Now after only very little use in two months time it won't take a charge. I would definitely stay away fro.this product,2022,03
Could not get it to work.,2022,03
mouse wheel randomly broke 2 months after purchasing mouse...pretty disappointed in this....,2022,03
This mouse worked for a day and then stopped. It was very comfortable to use and silent click which was nice. But it stopped working so it’s pointless.,2022,03
"It's cute looking, comfortable. Except short uncomfortable charging cord (just use battery!), it was great.And then broke after 2 weeks. Just stopped.",2022,03
"This is made with low quality. The adapter for USB-C doesn’t work, as in it doesn’t even fit into a USB-C port (I tried multiple to make sure this was the common denominator). The mouse comes apart too easily. The battery life is poor. Do not waste your money buying.",2022,03
"Buy Buy Buy IT!!!!!!!!Its so quiet, so soft and so comfortable. Its easy to travel with and connectivity is great. Battery life is amazing!",2022,03
I was enjoying the mouse but after 50 days it malfunctioned and the rotary portion did not work.,2022,03
"The mouse worked well for a couple days but then intermittently started cutting out, and after a week it wouldn’t stay turned on for more than 2 seconds despite it being fully charged. It’s very cute but unfortunately will be going back.",2022,03
Randomly turns off/dies after a short period of time,2022,03
I love the colors of the led lights and it works great!,2022,03
Works on my 2022 MacBook Air. Battery life is really good and the mouse feels good and clicks are very satisfying. Only downside is the adaptor is big and ugly.,2022,03
This mouse was delivered missing 1 of the track strips on the bottom of the mouse. I decided to use it anyways since that shouldn’t impact the function. It worked for a few days and then started having problems. I have to click several times before I can get a response from it. It also barely holds a charge.,2022,03
It really lives up to the silent clicking making it comfortable in a way. The batter also seems to last quite a few days if you turn it off when it’s not in use. It also has various light patterns when you click the button in the middle. The silent clicking is what really gets me.,2022,03
Already stopped working exactly after the return window closed.,2022,03
No need for further comments here. This product will speak for itself,2022,03
I really loved the size and feel as well as how quiet it was. But it only lasted about 8 months before it completely crapped out and never worked again. I suppose it’s a good short term solution.,2022,03
"It's size is perfect for both travel and for my hands. The LED is a great feature and works just as well as the wired one for my PC. I even bought my mother one, and she loves it too.",2022,03
This mouse stopped working not even 3 weeks after I started using it. Not worth it.,2022,03
"Love this mouse! It’s very smooth and the battery life last pretty long. The led lights are bright but not too distracting if u like to game in the dark like i do. I ended up losing the small piece that goes plugs into my computer tho i wish i could just order that piece. Also if the charger was a bit longer that would be better, i hate trying to use the mouse while plugged in charging it has no range. Other than that it’s a good buy",2022,03
I charged it. It still will not work. The mouse still will not work.,2022,03
This mouse came in handy when I needed it most after my other one came up missing.,2022,03
"This product works intermittently. I’ve made sure to charge it, and even with a full charge, it won’t click every time when I try to do so or it will get stuck with and without a mouse pad.",2022,03
Worked great till the roller broke. Used 3 times.,2022,03
Not for tablets and won’t accept a return.,2022,03
the mouse doesn't use batteries but if you charge it it dies in like an hour. its a piece of crap,2022,03
"I love this little mouse! Very well built and sturdy (dropped it twice and nothing happened to it), the colors do not fade, fun lighting, reliable, and very long charging/battery life! I use it almost every day, and haven’t had to charge it in weeks! I ended up buying another one for my daughter, and it’s just as well made!",2022,03
I bought 5 months ago and it stopped working. It’s cheap. I suggest not buying this.,2022,03
 Product is not compatible with the the description started for this item. I Will be making sure to get my refund returned.,2022,03
"This mouse has a low profile which fits my hand perfectly.  The point glides smoothly over the screen.  I haven't seen any difference in pointer speed between the three DPI settings, but it doesn't matter because it is fast enough.  Can't say enough good things about the fact that this mouse is rechargeable but I have been using it daily for about a week and it shows no sign of running down or needing recharging.  The kaleidoscope effect of changing colors is cool, makes me want to turn out the lights and use the computer in a darkened room.  I would definitely recommend this mouse.",2022,03
"This is the second mouse I have gone through in less than three months. I ordered the second one on Jan. 30, 2022. I had bought the initial one on Jan. 11, 2022. Today, March 22, mine starting sparking at work and the battery burnt through the wires inside. This could have easily become a horribly DANGEROUS situation!!  That was the second one I bought. The first one, the page scroll/roller ball broke. This also happened to the second one before the battery SPARKED AND BURNT UP WIRES. I am assuming you are a company that values your customers and has a strong moral standing. How do you suggest you resolve this issue?I hope to hear from you soon,Dissatisfied Customer",2022,03
It's nice looking and the wife absolutely loves it and it's vibrant colors. I got her the mint green one and it works like a champ. I didn't like the feel of a big flat mouse under my hand but she said that it isn't a problem and likes it so that's the important thing.,2022,03
Worked great for about 2 weeks and then the battery kept dying faster and faster.  Now it cannot even hold a charge.  So it now rests in the garbage can.,2022,03
"Really liked the look/feel/quiet click, but it broke on me after a few days!",2022,03
There was no USB C adapter included.  So it’s essentially useless if you need it for a USB C system.,2022,03
Horrible,2022,03
Unacceptable. 3 days after purchase trackwheel stopped working. Everything else works except that. So frustrating to not have that for easy access.,2022,03
I had to return this because it did not connect and the signal was constantly lost. I finally got my money back after 2 weeks -_-,2022,03
"It’s strange to hold but, it works for it’s intended purpose. It’s not completely silent, but it’s quiet and that’s good enough for me.",2022,03
"Great mouse, sleek and fun.  great price!",2022,03
It broke after being used for one week,2022,02
"Bought to replace older belkin that had no wheel.  I'm trying to learn cad so the wheel is necessary... this Mouse is amazing, i can't believe the cost.  My girlfriend stole it to take to work so I'm ordering another one... very impressed.",2022,03
"It worked great, it would get a little slow when it needed charging but all of a sudden it won't come on even after charging.",2022,03
It was ok while it worked. Prefer battery to having to charge it via USB. Only worked 4 months and the roller mechanism broke.,2022,03
I  LOVED this mouse until the scroll wheel broke a week after the return window. Very disappointed!!,2022,03
I have had this mouse for a while and I have barely used it because the lag is so bad. SO SO SO SO SO BAD. It doesn't follow. It's so slow. It's infuriating. I do graphic work and cannot have a mouse that doesn't act in real time. I do not recommend.,2022,03
It broke within 2 days from  falling off a laptop onto table. I've had other computer mice that fell down the same distance all the way up to down the stairs at worknever had an issue do not reccomend,2022,03
"I bought this because it was rechargeable and for the ergonomic design. After using it for awhile, I plugged it in a charged it. Worked for awhile, then it would only work for a few hours, then not at all. When I plugged it in, I noticed that I had to move the connection (where it plugs into the device) to the left, then it would light up, but if I let go, nothing.  I would not recommend this product!",2022,03
I really love this little mouse as it is easy to use and I can put it in a safe mode so I don't have to keep recharging it and saving on having to buy batteries. My laptop is used primarily for embroidery files so I don't use it for gaming and can't address that.,2022,03
"I just used this mouse for work a few hours a day and it inexplicably stopped turning on when I flipped the switch after just 10 days. I plugged it in to charge like I'd done a few times before and the blue light came on. When the blue light went off I unplugged it and switched it on, but it flashed red a couple of times and wouldn't work. I repeated the process with the same outcome. I know it's a cheap mouse but wow, I got less than one day of use for every dollar I spent.",2022,03
I loved the mouse and it worked great for the first couple of weeks. And then the scroll wheel is no longer working.,2022,03
I needed a mouse that was reliable and easy to use. This was perfect ! Wireless and just plug in and use. Love the different colors. Don’t think twice get this mouse asap !,2022,03
Great purchage & very satified,2022,03
Connects easily & super cute.,2022,03
Very easy to use,2022,03
Perfect fit for my small laptop and its case. and it works great.,2022,03
The slime design makes it easy to transport. the usb piece fits nicely under neither. When it goes into sleep move just click the button and its back up and running!,2022,03
Absolutely loved this mouse. But it stopped working all of the sudden. After reading reviews it seems several others had the same issue. But I guess that's what you get when you purchase something that is only $14. 🤷‍♀️😞,2022,03
It’s very comfortable to use. Minimal noise,2022,03
The mouse is exactly as it appeared. I love the lightness and design. I didn't feel aggrevating symptoms of my carpel tunnel as quickly after use. This enabled me to work longer.,2022,03
Works great! Charge lasts a long time. NO MORE BATTERIES!!!,2022,03
Won’t hold a charge. Haven’t been able to use since I’ve got it cause it won’t turn on after multiple attempts,2022,03
Definitely holds a charge. The day it arrived I put it in charge and it's still going weeks later on a single charge.,2022,03
I brought this mouse for my work computer and it works well,2022,03
The mouse is sleek and cool looking especially with the the colors.  But after a few months. It won't hold charge and the input for the charge cable is loose nd won't try charge unless it held in a certain angle nd pushed it with force,2022,03
I bought this to use at work as they only provided a wired mouse. I charged it before taking it in and it's been 2 weeks now and I haven't had to recharge it yet. It fits comfortably into my hand and is lightweight.,2022,03
Great,2022,03
love this mouse. its lightweight and i love that its USB charge. A great value for the price.,2022,03
"I got tired of using my laptop keyboard and decided rj invest. I love the led colors with the mouse although I rarely change the settings. I love that I don’t have to switch batteries and all I have to do plug it in. I could tell after about a week including me leaving my mouse on a few times that it was time for a charge. My mouse began to lag and I went ahead and plugged it up. Also, the color of the mouse matches with the picture well",2022,03
"In less than 2 months after purchasing, the scrolling wheel stopped working.",2022,03
"It comes clean, mine is dirty because I eat while doing homework. Glows perfectly and comes with a charger and plug in for your computer.",2022,03
"Beware, this mouse did not hold up! It wouldn't charge correctly after a week. Had to return! 😥",2022,03
Sleep mode and charge life is great,2022,02
"Bought this 2 months ago, stopped working yesterday. Tried charging it and using it on different surfaces, nothing. Curser won't budge. Definitely not worth it, now I'm looking for a new one.",2022,03
I like not having to replace batteries all of the time and also the sleek design and color!,2022,03
"It works great with lighting up, clicking, speed.. the scroll doesn’t work to move the screen up and down.",2022,03
"It works okay in the first couple of minutes, and then the cursor starts to jump other than moving smoothly as the mouse moves. Also, clicks often fail to work at the first button down. Sometimes several clicks need to trigger an action. I threw it away and ordered other products.",2022,03
The charge does not last a full day,2022,03
"Well I thought it would be clever to buy two of these and rotate them. However not only do they not maintain a charge WHILE TURNED OFF (I literally have to charge both after one dies, and it's not like these things last that long, so that's pathetic). But also when fully charged and following the troubleshooting, the mouse still will just flash red and not work.I got a 3rd to replace the 2nd, but that one was just as bad. They are all bad. This is a waste of money. You're better off dealing with batteries than these cheap, wasteful electronic items that will just end up in the landfill anyway. Please don't buy, because you will be happy with it right until...the return window closes.",2022,03
"The mouse stopped working after a week of purchase, it did not respond to any movement , I cannot recommend it to someone else, cheap product",2022,03
it was a sleek and nice looking mouse but the usb got annoying and broke easily,2022,03
Did the job,2022,03
This product didn’t/wouldn’t charge,2022,03
The scroll wheel broke after 6 weeks of minimal use.,2022,03
"Great mouse - when it works. Sleek design, good performance. Six week after I got it it stopped working. It is  just few days past the product return deadline. I have written to the manufacturer, lets wait what happens.",2022,03
So easy to use and fits perfectly in my briefcase.,2022,03
The wheel just spins and is not working anymore only 42 days after I purchased it.  Returns are only within 30 days.  I can't afford to buy a new one every 45 days so I'll have to try a different brand and seller.,2022,03
"This mouse was very dissapointing. It was hard to use, and finally after a couple of months it broke completly!",2022,03
Bought this in January and only use it tops two days a week and it stopped working.,2022,03
This product doesn't charge at all,2022,03
Mouse is very pretty aesthetics of it is nice it handles well.  But it broke within a couple days of getting it.  The button stuck. I wouldn’t click anymore.  Unfortunately I liked it so well this was the second one that I ordered and the first one that I ordered the rollerball stopped working but it’s too late to return that one so now I have two broken ones.  The lights on at a really cool the battery lasts really long time in between charging but now I have two of them that have broken and a six week. I think,2022,03
"I bought this two weeks ago and it already does not work. It's is cheaply made, and I am very disappointed.",2022,03
"Not worth it, window to return is small, broke in a month.",2022,03
works,2022,03
Good for its intended purpose. Very light and flimsy but it works so far.,2022,03
It for my laptop doing graphic design,2022,03
"The mouse feels amd looks great,that's the only positive aspect there is this thing cannot even connect to its own hardware so half the time you're just clicking happening this piece of garbage connects.",2022,03
Appearance is a bit different than I was expecting. Also doesn't glide smoothly and quickly enough on the screen not sure why. Sending back after 1 day of use. Swiched to my old bluetooth mouse within hours,2022,03
"When I bought this mouse, I really liked it. It felt nice, worked well on a consistent basis, and the colors give my desk a pretty touch. It was cheap so I guess you can't expect it to last but I was hoping to get at least a year. After 9 months of light daily use, it doesn't want to charge. Even if I leave it plugged in all night, in the morning it barely has any charge. This is a decent mouse if you don't mind having to buy a new one a couple of times a year but I'm going to just spend a little more and get one that is, hopefully, better quality.",2022,03
Really,2022,03
I bought this wireless mouse for my classroom so that I could click around on my smartboard without having to walk across the room to my desk each time. Sounds silly but it saves me a lot of instructional time! The battery life is great and I only charge it about once a week - even with me forgetting to turn it off before I go home each day  (sleep mode for the win!),2022,03
"It's easy to charge and no batteries required, I really like it",2022,03
Doesn’t work.,2022,03
I bought this for my son and it dies very fast and it does change colors by itself like it shows on here,2022,03
I didn’t receive all the accessories 🤬,2022,02
Very smooth and quiet!,2021,07
I have been able to use this product since aug 2021 and then out of the blue the roller wheel stopped working like it disconnected from the internal workings and now wont scroll. This is very disappointing.,2022,03
"I unboxed it, plugged it into my laptop after charging it, and it would not even connect to my computer at all. I'm completely dissatisfied with my time and money with this product. If you're looking for a mouse, this isn't it.",2022,03
"Soft click, it's light weight, cute lights! Love it!",2022,03
It is exactly what I wanted,2022,03
"I've only used this product once and it stopped working after only using it for an hour and a half after being fully charged. It says just two hours of charging can last 7-15 days, but obviously that's a lie. The USB receiver also arrived broken. Don't waste your money on this.",2022,03
"I bought one, it didn't work out of the box.. exchanged it for another, and it lasted for 2.5 months before breaking again. Spend a dollar or two more and another brand!! This one might be the right look, but it will only waist your money..",2022,03
"Very laggy, ended up buying a different one. No matter what I did, I had to reset it every 20 minutes because it was so laggy.",2022,03
Love it,2022,03
It was great for the 2 weeks it lasted. After 2 weeks it would light up as if it was charging but never would hold the charge.,2022,03
"This product was great when I got it. It was RGB, however was expecting to be able to change colors, this part doesn't matter as much as the rest.  Received the Item Jan 27th, 2022, worked up until the morning of 3/14/2022 I used it every day.  Not sure what is going on with it.  As I can flip the power from off to on and the red light flickers, but doesn't come on.",2022,03
"Loved this mouse. But I literally bought it in October and today March 14th it broke. Super sad, was hoping it will last longer",2022,03
Just got it. Seems fine,2022,03
Bought it expecting to be able to use it and it didn’t have the adapter like it is stated!,2022,03
It was great until it stopped working! Won’t even turn on. I charged it of course and still doesn’t work at all. Time window to return passed?! Really???!!! Not what you expect from Amazon. I’ll be taking steps to get my money back you can bet on that. I don’t care how cheap it was!,2022,03
"worked great for the first six months--good tracking, long charge--but the scrolling wheel started acting up shortly after getting it, and now the mouse won't turn on even when plugged directly into the computer. should've paid more for a better quality mouse, that's on me.",2022,03
"I’ve used it 3 times and it was fine and now it will not charge when plugged in, shows red for about 5 seconds and then nothing.  Likes the mouse if it would work. Very disappointed in this product.",2022,03
"It looked fine and worked fine initially, but after three months of careful use, the right button stopped working correctly. It acts now as the button is permanently pressed. I wish I could replace or return, but it isn't possible anymore.",2022,03
Cursor would only work a couple minutes & then freeze up. I love the look & shape but it’s completely useless.,2022,03
"I love this mouse,  it's easy to use.  When I don't use it for a period of time it shuts off and with the click of the mouse its back on. I also love the changing colors.",2022,03
"The mouse is aesthetically very cute, and does feel nice on the hand. Main issue is for both gaming and other computer activities, the mouse will randomly jump across the screen, which has never happened with any other mouse. It's led to misclicks, I've deleted emails I didn't mean to because of it. Essentially just unreliable.",2022,03
An absolutely great choice for office work.,2022,03
"Great value, Comfortable and stylish little mouse+",2022,03
Broken and flimsy on arrival,2022,03
Scroll function randomly stopped working 2 months after buying. Can no longer return/replace,2022,03
It's a very practical mouse you color is pretty.,2022,03
So I have had this mouse for about 4 weeks and It works perfectly I never encountered the problems people had with it stopping and people say that the battery dies too quickly which I have been using on the same battery without charging it for 3 days. My cursor has also never messed up it works just fine. The only problem I have with this device is the lighting is not nearly as impressive as I thought it would be but I guess that's what you get for buying a mouse for 11$,2022,03
Easy to charge and to use.,2022,03
NOT WORKING AFTER 2 months of use,2022,03
"This mouse is great! I've been using it for a month now and really love it. I was a little unsure about the lack of battery power, but the charge holds for a long time. I've only had to charge it once with daily use. Highly recommend!",2022,03
Great mouse! Works just as described Unfortunately the charging cable didn't work Thank goodness we have extras Great purchase tho!,2022,03
"The charge doesn’t last long, the light work, then doesn’t at times. I have it to my granddaughter. She likes it enough.",2022,03
"No battery life, only used it four times, at first it didn’t get past 3 hours of being on and now it lasts 10 min.",2022,03
Had it two months and it’s already dead. What a piece of junk. So glad it quit working right after the return window closed. Quit scrolling and moving the cursor on the screen. Cheap piece of garbage.,2022,03
"Good product, exceded my expectations",2022,03
"I really like this mouse. It's small and slim, so it doesn't make my wrist sit at a weird angle. It also has a good battery life. I think I've only charged it like once since I bought it several months ago. It's pretty responsive and light, and overall, it's great quality for the money. It does feel a little cheap and fragile because of how light it is, but that doesn't bother me at all.",2022,03
Very slick.,2022,03
Took a chance and ordered this for at the office. Wanted something a little more comfortable and without a cord. Excellent choice love love love this mouse and the charge staying power is amazing,2022,03
This came out of the box not working. Description and reviews are very misleading. Very cheap and glitchy.,2022,03
Just bought this mouse and was really excited to use it but even after charging for multiple hours the mouse will turn on briefly and then immediately stop functioning. Just goes to show that items this cheap often are too good to be true. Save your money and buy a better mouse.,2022,03
"It was great while it worked with the first one that I got. Then it started not working and I messaged the sellers and they send me another one. Tell me how the new one didn't work at Alllll, such a terrible product don't waste your money or your time trying to make it work.",2022,03
I have this mouse for 29 days and now it just doesn’t charge…no idea why and I’ve tried everything. DO NOT BUY. It’s cheap.,2022,03
This mouse is very stylish and ergonomic! It is very responsive. I love it!,2022,03
The thing is just laggy and terrible and you stop using it because it's so frustrating. Junk.,2022,03
Stopped working after a couple of weeks,2022,03
Stopped Working After Two or so months of having it.,2022,03
"After having this mouse for 2 weeks, it stopped working. Computer doesn't recognize the usb and wont pair with it wirelessly. This is the replacement for the original one that broke after being dropped a short distance. No way of contacting the seller.  Very disappointed",2022,03
I use it a lot. Had for over a month. No issues. I have gold and it’s cute. Very easy to maneuver.,2022,03
"Works great, very reactive, colors look fantastic while they go through all the different colors. As well as has an option for just red if you’re not feeling fancy",2022,03
stop working the wheel just stopped working just rolled and rolled,2022,03
I liked the way it fit my hand.,2022,03
"Bought this mouse in January and fully charged it the same day i got it. Until this day, as I am writing this review I haven't recharge it not once. I must say I use it a fair amount of time, not to full extent everday but i do use it. I really like the sleep mode, that preserve the battery a whole lot because sometimes i just get up leave it and go out on the road, spend a few hours and come back and it's still here doing great.I feel pretty satisfied, with what I payed for this I didn't expect it to hold up like this but I give thanks...Five stars for this...",2022,03
I love how fast it connects and how cute it looks,2022,03
Nice little mouse that lasts a while on one charge. I love not having to replace batteries!,2022,03
"Broke within 3 days, didn't think of returning it, just threw in the garbage.",2022,03
" This product is not worth the headache. The first mouse stopped scrolling after 2 weeks of use. I returned it and 2 days after using the new mouse I am returning it and requesting a refund.  The mouse doesn't hold a charge because there is a red light around the whole mouse that is always on, EVEN WHEN SWITCHED OFF. The previous mouse wasn't like this and worked well until it stopped scrolling. Now I have to go to a second location to return the mouse again. They should reimburse the gas I've used returning this mouse. I probably spent more in gas than what I paid for the mouse.As you can see in the video, it is off but the light is on. I turn it off and the light on. I then turn it off again and the light doesn't turn off.",2022,03
"Love using this mouse. The LED lights are fascinating and fun. So easy on the hand and wrist no pressure, no numbness or tingling and my hand doesn't get tired and achy. Have carpal tunnel so love the relief I get now and know that will be really helpful and appreciated after my surgery.",2022,03
Home PC,2022,03
Will not hook up to my laptop,2022,03
"Good value for the $. Looks good, quiet buttons, fancy light up feature, no batteries to replace.",2022,03
Stopped charging after 6 months. Poor quality.,2022,03
Doesn’t hold a charge used it as a mouse for my laptop charged it once and it stopped working,2022,03
It is a little slippery in the hand but I have been using a PC mouse....,2022,03
"I've had this less than a year.  It's been wonderful but is starting to get skippy & glitchy to where it's unusable.  It's a shame, it's a nice, colorful, quiet mouse but evidently not made very well.",2022,03
I just got a new all in 1 computer amd needed a new mouse to bring some life to my conpletely white computer. I love the different colors it lights up. I also love the feel of the mouse and the size is perfect. I would recommend this mouse. It's affordable.,2022,03
i really enjoyed this mouse that arrived so promptly. After my first few clicks i realized it is the best mouse i had ever used for regular writing needs. The design /color is very stylish too.,2022,03
Works perfect.  Smooth no issues.  Battery last forever,2022,03
I was excited for this mouse and it worked well up until now. I’ve only had this mouse for two months. Already stopped working and I’ve only used it 4 times. Don’t recommend buying. Too late to get my refund and that sucks!,2022,03
"Works great, don't have to buy batteries, plug it in and charge it!",2022,03
I don’t like it,2022,03
I had this mouse for two weeks and then it just stopped working which is so sad because it’s so cute,2022,03
"The battery doesn’t even last one day! I pretty much have to keep it plugged in at all times and I have the light setting turned off. It looks like a nice mouse and the wheel and clicking is fine, but what’s the point if it’s never charged?! Don’t waste your money on this mouse.",2022,03
"I bought this in November and it stopped working in January. It also feels cheaply made, I should’ve know this. It does not charge. I’ve charge it for a long time multiple times, it barely turned on before it died again. Piece of garbage!",2022,03
I don't know about gaming but for everything else it works great.,2022,03
"After receiving this mouse, I charged the mouse per the instructions on a normal rate USB charger (non fast charger). This took a little under two hours for a full charge. The blue light goes out when fully charged.I installed the USB receiver into my computer and the mouse was recognized immediately on Windows 11. The mouse seems to work smoothly, and the mouse pointer is swift. You can adjust pointer speeds if it is too fast. The mouse lights up around the sides when in use, it is a bit quirky but it doesn't bother me. Also the mouse will go to sleep if not used for a certain period of time, probably to prolong the battery charge. To wake the mouse I just move it or press a button.Overall it is a decent wireless/rechargeable mouse.",2022,03
Ergonomic,2022,03
Sux. stopped working after a month of use.  will not charge.,2022,03
Scroll wheel broke after very light use.  Would not recommend.  Would have been a nice mouse otherwise.,2022,03
"Bought this to replace my old Apple mouse.  It works well, holds a charge, easy to recharge - no problems.  It did take a little relearning to use the ""wheel"" vs the Apple mouse smooth glide system.  Great price too!",2022,03
This worked great for the first 9 months and then it didn't work at all. I didn't use it daily. Sent an email to the one provided and never got a response.,2022,03
"Love the mouse itself, however, charging wire is too short",2022,03
Does the job !,2022,03
This came all scratched up and feels very cheap.,2022,02
"This mouse changes colors so tweens would get a kick out of it. I love the sleep mode, as it saves energy. I purchased the gold mouse and its very classy looking. I like the fact no battery is required and I've only had to charge once in a 30-day period.",2022,02
"Beautiful and ergonomic, the only thing I would say is the battery doesn't last longer, but in general it's a great product",2022,02
"It was a wonderful mouse when it arrived. However, it quit working.",2022,02
Stopped working shortly after can’t get a refund or exchange,2022,02
It’s very cute but it lags and skips around a lot unfortunately!,2022,02
"Doesn't charge fast, the scroll broke within days, the mouse completely stopped working after a few weeks. It constantly would stick-",2022,02
Mouse stop working after a couple of days.  Feel cheap.  Got what I paid for.Always felt like I was holding the wrong end of the mouse.,2022,02
The charge doesn't last very long so basically its a wired mouse cuz its charging all the time. So disappointing.,2022,02
The mouse stopped taking charge from the charger after 6 months,2022,02
Stoped working after a few weeks. It won’t charge.,2022,02
It doesn’t stay charged and it feels too light weight in your hand.,2022,02
It works for now. Will see after some time….,2022,02
Great product that is a snap to setup and use. Plug it in and charge it and plug the receiver into your system and your good to go. It fits my hand perfectly and is easy to use.,2022,02
"Bought this on January 12, and on March 2 the scroller wheel stopped working. No way to fix it, so the mouse is useless now.",2022,02
Absolutely beautiful and sleek….never worked. I charged it until it indicated it was fully charged but it never worked.,2022,02
"I really wanted to love this mouse, but it is TERRIBLE. The scroll hardly works, and yes I tried multiple mousepads. Add to that the inability to CLICK (a core functionality of a computer mouse...) and the whole thing is a piece of crappy light up plastic. 0/10",2022,02
Feels and looks cheaply made. Not to mention it broke in less then a week!,2022,02
"The wife needed a new mouse. I found this one, she said she liked it, I ordered it, she loves it. Very sleek, works perfectly, USB charging instead of batteries... awesome!",2022,02
It turned on and that is about all it did. It wouldn't move the cursor. I tried different mouse pads and surfaces and finally gave up.,2022,02
"the wheel broke after a little over a month. I am not on my laptop too much, so I don't understand it! I haven't even had to recharge it after the first initial charge. It's a great big nope for me.",2022,02
"I bought this because I’m trying to minimize the amount of wires on my desk and because the color matches my pc case but it’s not worth it. The mouse barely works and it takes forever to get it to actually click on what you want, like it’s pretty and the colors are cute but those are the only good things about this. Thankfully I play with a controller so it doesn’t hinder my gaming but if you do play mouse and keyboard absolutely don’t get this.",2022,02
 Its really great I don't use it for gaming if you are looking for that review stop here but for other review keeping reading. It changes color on its own you can't personally change it that's a bummer. It slowly changes color one thing that bothers me is the default red light. When you move it the red light appears and it over powers the other changing colors. If your fine with the red light then buy it. Other than that it does its job really pretty too. The mouse is a matte black so its not shiny just wanted to mention that.,2022,02
it became sluggish and wasnt working properly with my mac after a month or so.,2022,02
"Love this product! Works great for work. It is nice it’s rechargeable, and the charge lasts a while.",2022,02
Worked good for a week. Cheap and doesn't work anymore. I tried to change battery but can't open it. And if it opens I can't figure it out. Order something else. Not this one. I did love the light on it.,2022,02
Not so comfortable on hand comparing to ​Microsoft mouse and the refresh rate seems inferior. The only superiority is it's design. For home purposes it is ok. It have very quit click,2022,02
Poor battery life. Need to. Charge  daily,2022,02
"Nice quality,  beautiful cards.",2022,02
"I knew what I was getting myself into reading the bad reviews; it stops working in a few weeks. Usually, I hedge my bets especially when a product has so many reviews that end up with a 4.5 star rating. Alas, I lost this bet. The scroll function, a key feature I look for in buying mice, stopped responding after a a few weeks. A fluke? I should buy a scratcher if so because I bought two, one white, one black, and they both failed around the same time.I’m wondering if this is actually engineered to perform this way, though, as I’m seeing many other reviews doing the same thing, but people being bribed for a 5 star, if replaced. Quite genius, actually. If you get angry customers to review, it promotes product engagement, but then the rating can be manipulated by replacing the cheap product and soliciting a 4-5 star review. If this indeed is the case, BRAVO. Brilliant way to get as many positive reviews for a subpar product.",2022,02
Scroll wheel broke after one day. Only used for less than an hour and it no longer scrolls and isn’t connected in the correct position anymore. Very light use. Hopefully replacement will be better quality. If I remember I’ll update review after using replacement.,2022,02
"I absolutely love this mouse.  First off I have to say my cat has knocked this done off the table multiple times and it still works.  That is huge with me.  Next it's a very nice mouse.  I love the colors it lights up with.  Its so nice to not have to worry about a battery too, just plug in and charge and ready to go.  I swear I charge it like once a month too and it still works great.  I highly recommend this mouse.",2022,02
 Great for the price! Very small but fits hand perfectly,2022,02
"I really liked that it was easy to set up. I really disliked the instructions, which left much to be desired. Once I figured out the problem myself setup was easy and seamless. I really like the way it looks and the ease of operation. It’s only been in use for one day so I guess I will keep hoping that it works as well over time.",2022,02
It stopped working after falling on the floor.,2022,02
"I love this mouse. I wish it did come with a battery option, but I still love it!",2022,02
"I like the idea of the rechargeable battery.  However, the charge of the battery does not last very long.  I will continue to use the mouse but intend to buy another for use when this one is being charged which is very often.",2022,02
 Let me start off this review by saying I was very excited to get this mouse because it matched my desk my bedroom and my laptop perfectly I absolutely loved the mouse right up until two weeks of having it and it completely stopped working. Don’t waste your money not worth it.,2022,02
Thinnest mouse i have ever seen.,2022,02
Is not USB C. It works well but plastic feels cheap and flymsy.,2022,02
I am very disappointed with the quality of life this mouse has. I bought it and was only able to use it four or five times and it has been a problem for me ever since. I’ve charged it adequately and it won’t start. I’m not sure if its a factory malfunction or not but it should still be working. I’ve owned it for a little over a month now.,2022,02
Love it,2022,02
 Mouse stopped working… i had it worked for a couple of days 🙄🙄🙄,2022,02
Nice,2022,02
I have had for a month and the roller broke. What a bummer.,2022,02
Sleep mode helps the charge last longer and it's great for the wrist!,2022,02
Love the feel of it with my hand and the fact it doesn't need to be charged every week.  I went over a week and a half before I had to charge it.,2022,02
"I ordered 2, 1 for work and 1for home. They are great until 1 died after 2 months. It indicated that it is charged but it does not function. It might be a bad switch?  They second died in less than 9 months of use. Disposable batteries would be better for the environment than disposing of multiple rechargeable that stop working faster than a battery runs out.",2022,02
Battery doesn’t last long. Maybe 48 hrs at a time?,2022,02
The mouse does not work.  Very disappointed.  It freezes on the screen.,2022,02
I was looking for a simple black LED mouse for work and this one is exactly what I was looking for. It works great and I have had no issues yet. Due to the size it can be a little uncomfortable if you are doing a lot of work using the mouse for an extended amount of time but this has only happened to me once.,2022,02
"works very well charges good , love it",2022,02
"The rest of the mouse is fine but the scroll wheel no longer scrolls - took just over 1 month for it to break, so I can't even return it now.",2022,02
all good,2022,02
Item does not work,2022,02
" The wireless mouse was great in the beginning, weeks later it wouldn’t keep a charge, when it did charge it would only work if it was hooked up to the charger on my laptop (meaning I still couldn’t use it) then I would unplug it and lights started going crazy!So I would turn the switch off and on to try and use it, epic FAIL!A waste of my hard working money!Then they only give you a certain amount of time to return, so basically it’s a total loss!",2022,02
Dont buy stopped working after 5 weeks,2022,02
It functions according to my expectation.,2022,02
"The lights are entertaining, it works well, and it survived the delivery driver squashing the package",2022,02
I should've listened others' review. I read but i thought it might be some specific situation. But my! the bluetooth don't work at all and now i have to trouble myself with all the returning work.,2022,02
IT QUIT WORKING!!! IT'S DEAD ER THAN DOOR KNOB!!!@,2022,02
 Love it. Love rose gold so this was perfect. You can have the lights like I did or just solid color or off. It is wireless and comes with a charger. And I love the quite clicks,2022,02
It stop working within 6 weeks.,2022,02
We were using an Amazon basic mouse and after a couple years it broke. We upgraded to this mouse and my teenage son loves it! He uses it at school with his laptop and loves how the colors light up under it.,2022,02
You won't hear the annoying clicking sound from this mouse.,2022,02
Bought it in September. Stopped working after a few days.  They sent me a replacement. Now it's February and it's totally died. I'm so sad. I use it at work.,2022,02
This is the best mouse I've used in a long time. I've bought them for my kids and my friends and I have back ups so when one is charging I always have one,2022,02
"I like the product and the idea - too bad that once the charge goes, it stops working.  I figured the first one was a lemon so got a replacement but same issue.  No idea why but just works for like a week and then dies.",2022,02
 Haven’t had this mouse for more than a week and the left click is already broken. It won’t snap back into place. I loved the mouse in the beginning which made me order a replacement. Hopefully this one doesn’t let me down.,2022,02
"Now that I'm an old man and don't need anything super fancy for my desktop, I replaced a Deathadder from 2010 with it.  Only been using it for about 10 hours, but no major complaints so far.  Takes a little bit of getting use to because it's sits so low, but the clicks feel nice and seems fairly responsive.",2022,02
Really smooth soft click I liked 👍,2022,02
"Easy to use, only took a couple hours to first charge. Looks cute !",2022,02
 Cute. Colorful. Small. Lightweight. Quiet/soft clicks. Easy quick set up.,2022,02
"I liked this mouse when it worked, but the scroll real broke within a couple weeks.",2022,02
For the price I realized I could have gotten something a lot better. It’s cheaply made. Glitches even with a full charge. I got the white one and I wish I would have read the reviews before hand because it does indeed show the whole internal lighting unit which just adds the the cheapness of it. It does the job still all considering I just think it’s value is overestimated.,2022,02
Scrolling wheel went lose (broke) less than a week after purchase.,2022,02
This product stopped working after a month and of course I am outside of my return window,2022,02
Was a little squirrely to use,2022,02
Love this mouse works great and great price,2022,02
I love this mouse. I love the led colored lights the most. Another one of my favorite is that it is magnetic and sticks to my laptop when I’m in the car or at the local coffee shop.,2022,02
I fell in love with the color changing of this product but it kept cutting off and sticking. I had to return it,2022,02
Good thing it's rechargeable because otherwise your changing batteries everyday instead of just plugging it in.,2022,02
This mouse was a waste of money it broke after using it one month. I bought another mouse a couple weeks ago and it will not charge. I do not recommend this mouse.,2022,02
Multi use can use this mouse for anything you need to get done. Smooth slick and overall perfect performance.,2022,02
Stoped working after a week,2022,02
This item did not work from the very beginning. I sent it back. Will not purchase from this company again.,2022,02
"I needed a mouse for my laptop and so I bought this! The set up was really easy. Simply charge the mouse, plug in the USB and done! The silent clicks are indeed quiet but I wouldn’t say they’re completely inaudible, but that’s totally okay with me! When the mouse charges, it turns blue and when it’s done charging, the light will switch off. When I turn on the mouse to the color mode, the colors fade nicely to the next. The only nitpick for me is that I wish the white part of the top of the mouse was more opaque so that the backlit colors don’t peek through it. But it’s personal preference. I also like how it came with a USB to USBC adapter just in case it needs to be used for a Mac. Overall, a great mouse!",2022,02
"Works really well, plus it looks nice! Great price, too!",2022,02
Had a bit of an issue but the customer service was fantastic and corrected it FAST!  ★★★★★,2022,02
Doesn’t hold charge long,2022,02
It was perfect until the wheel stopped working before 6 months of use,2022,02
Great Price and service,2022,02
"Never buy this product!!!When I buy something, I usually look at product reviews, but this product seems to have a lot of problems, unlike reviews. I don't usually post reviews, but I'm posting this product review in hopes that there won't be victims like me. I bought a mouse and it worked fine at first. But after charging it, it started to get weird and didn't work at all. So I thought there might be a small problem, so I exchanged the new one instead of a refund. Received a new mouse and it worked fine for another few days. But after charging it again, it didn't work. The product user manual says it is sensitive to charging, but this is a serious problem. I bought this product for the convenience of not using the battery or wire, but I think it makes no sense to not work because of the charging prolem.",2022,02
I bought this for my nephew and unfortunately he told me that its just all over the place on his chromebook screen..doesn't go where you need it to go etc,2022,02
Randomly moves the cursor to the top left. Definitely a 1/5 for gaming.,2022,02
"Nice feel and looks nice, but the scroll wheel works on and off making more advanced tasks difficult.",2022,02
Love it! The rose gold color is so cute and it’s lightweight! Loves the light change. Works great for me!,2022,02
"I recently got a job working from home and needed a mouse to accompany. I purchased the rose gold, it is beautiful, came on time, and hooked up with no issues. If you want to use the color changing lights, make sure to flip the switch on the bottom of the mouse all the way to the sunshine symbol, took me a few to figure that out, but otherwise great product!!",2022,02
It's quiet and cute. I love all the colors and the battery last a long time,2022,02
Battery life has been great so far. It goes to sleep mode when not in use but there’s also on/off function. I love that you can charge it also - I just plug it in once every few days overnight.,2022,02
"Bought this twice because it matched my keyboard, both times it broke within a month.I used it lightly throughout the day too",2022,02
 bought this mouse read direction simple and easy plug in to phone charger for 2 hrs then unplug mouse will turn blue say it need to be charged 2 hrs then it will turn red then go to mouse plug in the usb port in to windows 10 computer then turn button on mouse underneath to on then try mouse out to see if it moves on computer i give this 5 out of 5 stars dont give in to bad reviws people post bad reviews and never reads instruction first,2022,02
"Love it. Came with the mouse itself , white cable , black usbc adapter . The white little adapter underneath the mouse easily connected to the  black usb that I used for my MacBook to usbc . The white small cable I believe to charge it. You can easily turn off the lights but they look really nice on. mouse is thin but comfortable! Although I order the silver to match my laptop it is not the exact same but close just a bit darker.",2022,02
It's 4 days past the return deadline and this item is not working any longer. Wow,2022,02
"The scroll wheel broke after a month or two. Have to buy another mouse, wont buy this again.It's a good size to save space  but it doesnt fit the hand well.",2022,02
Poor quality. Does not hold charge.  Has a sleek design but mouse does not work as intended.,2022,02
"Its very quite, you can work without that horrendous clicking sound of a regular mouse. You will love this device.",2022,02
got it broken. The scroll works but nothing else works. Asked to get a new mouse but I have to go somewhere to return it which I don’t have time for.,2022,02
"I loved this mouse...for the literal two weeks (14 days) that I had it and it was working.  For no apparent reason, the scroll wheel just suddenly stopped working, approximately five seconds after I had last used it.  I had not subjected it to  any pressure, or abuse of any sort.  I was looking at a document, scrolled down, continued reading, tried to scroll down and...nope.  In the lower ratings, this seems to be a common problem.  I'm bummed, I really did love the mouse. :(",2022,02
loved this mouse until it stopped working several months after purchase. It will no longer charge and I cannot use it. Very disappointed.,2022,02
Very frustrating as they both broke on the same day about 1 month after purchase and too late to return.,2022,02
Long lasting power recharges fast,2022,02
"This mouse didn't last a month. The buttons broke and the seller will not replace it. Waste of money, DO NOT BUY",2022,02
"The wireless mouse worked well in the begining. It was small but it fit in my hand well and the lights were a nice, though not necessary, feature. I received it in September. It wasnt something I used every day, about once or twice a week. In February the scroll wheel just broke. It spins loosely and no longer scrolls on the screen. I do not use it often and I am definitely not rough on it.  I am dissapointed in the quality of this product.",2022,02
"The mouse looks great, feels great, but I didn't get more than a few hours out of it before it died.  I left it plugged in for several hours but it doesn't stay on anymore.  Despite several recharge attempts, it just doesn't turn on anymore.",2022,02
"This was a good mouse I got as a gift and I really liked it until it didn’t work anymore! After a while it stoped working and I looked at some other reviews that said they got a defective one, well I guess I did and they are kinda common to be defective so I would only risk buying it if you want the mouse a decent amount. I would say you’re chance of it being broken is like a 3/10. Also, it only stops working after like 4/5 days so you won’t know until then if you buy it…  Also I did like that they added a usb-c adapter in the box. I use they adapter for something else now.",2022,02
To slow. Don’t buy,2022,02
"Nice mouse, the battery lasts along time before needing recharged and I like that I do not have to use a mousepad with it as it works great even without one.",2022,02
The color and shape are very nice but the mouse and the packaging arrived very dirty. The scroll wheel on the mouse is made from a cheap rubbery/silicone material and is completely crooked. It also did not have a good feel when testing it out - not smooth and feels like it take a lot of extra pressure to operate than others. Not sure if this is due to it being crooked or not but either way this will be returned.,2022,02
The wheel was broken the second day I used it,2022,02
I love the color (rose gold) and it works great on a variety of surfaces. I just wish it would alert me when the battery is low so I can charge it before I need it for work.,2022,02
I like it,2022,02
It was working fine. I busted it maybe 6 times max and it stopped workingIt looks to be charging but isn’t.  When placed into on mode the red light flashes and goes off right away.,2022,02
Mouse stopped working after a month.  Horrible quality.  Wouldn’t buy again,2022,02
Had to use different type c to usb adapter because this one did not work.,2022,02
 Less thank a month later the part that goes into the computer has broken,2022,02
This mouse is gorgeous! It is so quiet and feels great in my hand. It synced with my laptop with ease. I do feel the charge doesn't last as long as I'd like but you can use it while it's charging which is nice. Definitely recommend :),2022,02
"Item came fast. Easy to set up and use. Love that it is rechargeable and you don't have to worry about constantly replacing the batteries. I use this at work. I plug it in at night to charge and it lasts all day while I work, with no issues. Would recommend this item.",2022,02
"came quickly, easy to set up...Delivery person put in spot close to door and knocked to let me know it was there, door bell not working, and he was wearing his  mask",2022,02
Is DEAD. Will not hold a charge. Cheap but not worth what I paid.,2022,02
"I ordered 2 of these for our new MacBook computers we got for ChristmasMy granddaughters broke after only a couple of uses, mine I finally tried setting up last week after being on Holiday and it doesn’t even work.Return windows are closed so they will make its way to trashDonNOT but this items, they are cheap and a waste!!",2022,02
I thought I had to keep charging this. I work 10 hour days and it hasn't died on me yet. Charged it 1 time in a week.,2022,02
"Simple, sleek, quiet and most of all, it has a USB C adapter for my MacBook Air.  The low profile design is ideal to be a carry around mouse if I need to bring one.I've used a lot of wireless mouse and this by far is the best.",2022,02
Doesn't work at all. I am tired of charging it and nothing happens. Wasted my money.,2022,02
Scroll wheel broke within a few weeks of use.,2022,02
"Really like the quietness of the clicks.  Flatter than most mice; took a little bit of getting used to but fine now.  Will be easy to travel with.  Very responsive.  Charges by USB and lasts for several days; no need to have extra batteries.  LED lights are fun, but hard to see in bright light.  I'm looking at the screen when I'm using the mouse (who doesn't?) so I don't really see the lights that much.",2022,02
I'm not the only person it seems. It works for some and not others. I don't know. Works fine with other computers i've plugged it into. Just don't buy it for a macbook.,2022,02
I U. could not pair the mouse to my MacBook Air. I really don't know why.,2022,02
I had a similar mouse that lasted two years....this one died after only a month.  Would work after charging for a few minutes and then stopped.,2022,01
USB receiver broke inside my son’s computer when he tried pulling it out. The reason he tried pulling it out was because the mouse wasn’t responding. This happened on the 1st time ever trying to pull it out. He had to use tweezer to take out the broken piece. Now none of it is working.,2022,02
"The “matte coating” started peeling off within a week or two of using it.  It still works well, but looks terrible.",2022,02
Worked well for a while but then stopped working completely after 6 months. It would charge but not turn on.,2022,02
Product quit working after return window of one month closed,2022,02
"This mouse looks good, but that's it. It works poorly. I finally gave up and went back to my old wired mouse. It just doesn't work well. You end up wildly moving it around and getting the cursor to where you want it to click on something is a struggle.  Would not recommend this mouse.",2022,02
"This mouse has met all of my requirements. When my old wireless mouse began to die, I opted for this rechargeable one because I was sick of batteries. This has a very long battery life, as I use it for up to 8 hours in a row. I use it for gaming (League of Legends) and it works perfectly (no lag), and it's crazy cute to boot with all of it's colours and such. Haven't had it very long, about a month and a half but very happy with it so far.",2022,02
Does it exactly what it should do.,2022,02
"Worked great for about 3 weeks, then died, never to be used again!",2022,02
I absolutely love this mouse. It is slim and sleek and looks great against the computer skin I ordered. It functions perfectly. I love the changing colors on the sides. The clicks are silent as advertised. I additionally love that it comes with a charging cord! Really happy that I purchased this wireless mouse.,2022,02
For the price it’s great.  It’s not too silent on the clicking but it’s ok I still love it.,2022,02
I tried charging this mouse but every time I take it off the charger it goes off. This was the first time even using it too.,2022,02
Fully charged it still started cutting out within an hour of use and now doesn't connect at all.,2022,02
"This mouse never worked. I charged it fully before first use, tried it on 4 different devices. Never worked....it turns on, the LED is nice, but it won't move or click. Will be requesting a refund. Don't get this. Not worth the hassle nor the price. This is a $2 P.O.S.",2022,02
"It sure looks nice, but there's no patch/fix/update to make this compatible with the new OS.  Boo hiss.",2022,02
The mouse cursor jumps around and doesn't stay where it's supposed to.,2022,02
I loved it until it stopped working today,2022,02
My daughter got this mouse for Christmas. After only 6 weeks the USB receiver broke and today the scroll wheel. Prior to this she said it was working well and she really liked the feel. Too bad the quality is crap.,2022,02
I got the USB receiver but no mouse in the box.???,2022,02
 I love that the colors change! It’s perfect. I haven’t even had to charge it since I got it!,2022,02
"Fully charged - I would work with the mouse for 1/2 hour - 45-minutes - and then it would lag and hardly move or not move at all. Fully charged - I kept having to switch USB ports to get it working again - which worked sometimes...but then it again would get stuck, lag, or stop working. I have the latest MAC/software - what I don't have is time for this mouse. I returned it. I bought another wireless USB mouse from another company that works perfectly.",2022,02
Loved this but based on other reviews I'm not the only one with this issue. Stopped recharging and working after 5 months.,2022,02
It is really great. It don't need charge for days then finally dead on me. I love it. Really cute and colorful. I use lots. I use with my MacBook Pro.,2022,02
This mouse is very light weight and the added colors make it super cool. It also holds a charge for a very long time which is helpful! Really great product for the price!,2022,02
"I love this wireless mouse. The lights are great and easy to assemble. If you need a wireless mouse for your laptop, get this.",2022,02
The mouse is well built and works as intended. The LED lighting is pretty cool. A step above the daily dull plain mice out there.,2022,02
This mouse quit working just one day past the return date and now I am stuckusing this mouse as a doorstop.Take my advice and purchase anything but this one.,2022,02
I bought this to replace another that I had used from august to December. I replaced the first one due to the spinner breaking. I was hoping that the new one would last longer but it only lasted 3 weeks. Completely disappointed in it.,2022,02
The mouse worked for less then a day. I bought it for school so I could edit thing and it stopped working within 20 minutes even after being charged the night before. Don't buy this product its a waste of money.,2022,02
Had this for a month and it’s already dead. Doesn’t charge and tried multiple usb cables. Would highly not recommend this or any no name products they are similar,2022,02
"This mouse doesn't work. It may go a few days of being ok, but it doesn't track properly and takes several minutes to start working. Then, it'll go days without working at all. I charge it for hours at a time, so I know that's not the problem.",2022,01
"I bought this product in November, by December the axle for the mouse wheel had snapped. I’ll admit I liked the size and look of it enough to buy it again….here we are in February and the same exact thing has happened again. I used this mouse for my work computer in the office, and certainly don’t aggressively use the scroll wheel. Yet the same axle has snapped on two of these units, both within the first 6 weeks of use. I’ve never had a mouse break apart like this before, so I have to conclude that this is just utterly cheap in the way it is made and the parts holding it together. I suppose you get what you pay for, a shame because aesthetically it is very nice.I will never buy this product again, I would advise anyone else to save your money and stay away. Pay a few extra dollars and find something that lasts more than a few weeks.Side note: I look forward to having the seller reach out to me to take down my review (rolls eyes). Perhaps I’ll just copy and paste their request here for the rest of you to read ha",2022,02
Do yourself a favor and do not buy this low quality mouse.,2022,02
Product does not work well. Don’t waste your money.,2022,02
I got this for my laptop and it does not work very well. It skips or just does not move at all. I gave it to my grandson thinking that since it says it for gaming that maybe it would work better for him but he does not like it at all. He says the feel of it is off and it does not stay connected.,2022,02
"You can't really beat the price, it's actually a little nicer than I was anticipating given what I paid. I would say it's worth the price, I just this with my chromebook for my online classes. The light is really cute too.",2022,02
"Purchased this for our laptop, daughter loves it! Colors are great!  Works good",2022,02
"I originally bought this mouse for my gaming PC and it works great it's smooth and easy to use without a wire. I would also recommend people get a pretty big mouse pad so you have room to move, it makes everything better",2022,02
I purchased this mouse for my new MacBook Pro. It is so much better than the Apple Magic Mouse I was using with my iMac. This mouse fits perfectly in my hand and is easy to maneuver. The adapter for the USB-C port on my Mac works and fits perfectly. I am extremely happy with my purchase. The mouse also is rechargeable which will save me money as I will not be purchasing AAA batteries anymore!I highly recommend this product. The quality and appearance of this mouse make it seem like a much more expensive product! 5 stars!!!!,2022,02
Of left unattended for a while....sleep mode works fantastic. Also great for gaming.,2022,02
I used this product once and tried to use it for my work laptop and the USB broke inside the laptop. I can’t get it out. DONT BUY THIS. It’s CHEAPLY made,2022,02
I bought one of these and liked it so much that I got one for both of my daughters also.,2022,02
"This wireless does not use batteries, you charge with your laptop when needed. There is light that changes color and it's pretty cool.",2022,02
Love the sensitivity settingThe battery lasts a long time between charges,2022,02
Love the light up mode… super quiet. Highly recommend,2022,02
This mouse was an absolute waste of money. I spent 20 dollars for the sensor to stop working in less than a week,2022,02
"I would have loved this product if my hands weren’t so picky, and plus it was a bit too flat for gaming on a pc. Works fine very silent clicks, still if you aren’t used to a flat mouse don’t buy it",2022,02
I liked the unit until it stopped functioning.,2022,02
"PROS- wireless ease of use- feels nice: soft, smooth, sleek- dampened click, quietCONS**- It has a very loud scroll button - the wheel works fine, but the button is difficult to press down and is quite loud, so it slightly defeats the purpose of a quiet mouse.- no additional buttons such as ""back"" or ""forward""ADDITIONAL- you have to charge the mouse with the included USB charger",2022,02
Stopped working already!,2022,02
I never had a wireless mouse before and wow! I’m blown away that the chord had been cut and I’m free to have total control from such a great distance. Great ergonomic design and also has lights that flash and I can charge it with no more batteries! I love this mouse🐹,2022,01
It is somehow ok,2022,01
My 16 year old daughter loves it! Got it to go with her new Chromebook for school. Definitely love the brand products I'm seeing.,2022,01
"Had it for only one day until I accidentally dropped it from less than a meter, and the stroller wheel broke. I could fix it with superglue but come on, I shouldn't have to do that. It was cheaply made and it literately broke day 1. If you're thinking of buying this don't let me stop you from trying it, just don't drop it.",2022,01
This lags so bad. NOT great,2022,01
"I don’t even use it full shift, and already broke, very disappointed.",2022,01
I love it. The battery last a decente amount of time,2022,01
"I had this mouse for about a week, I use it for work and once it died i used the cable it came with to charge it. I left it plugged in for a few hours and now it wont turn on at all. It flashes red and turns off. Waste of money",2022,01
Nice look to it,2022,01
came missing USB receiver.,2022,01
"It was working fine, until the mouse wheel broke three weeks in. Now useless.",2022,01
The first mouse lasted 2 months and bought the same mouse to replace it.  It died within a day of using it.  Buy cheap - get cheap.  Not worth trying to have it replaced so am sending it back for a refund.  The first one worked great and had a satisfying button click... a shame it didn't last very long.,2022,01
Box was open and the mouse was dirty. Like really? It looks used and has so many gross black hard spots.,2022,01
Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift. We tried multiple times to sync it to her computer. It would work for a couple of seconds and then stop working. Return window closed and I’m stuck with it.  Made cheaply. Don’t purchase.,2022,01
It really is,2022,01
"Very light weight and comfortable to use for basic computer tasks.  It was also very easy to set up, took less than 2 minutes as it came charged. Also the Vitter life has been great so far only needing to charge 1 time in the 2 weeks of having the item.",2022,01
After looking at the reviews of this particular LED mouse I decided to give it a try. I received it and so far I am very pleased with how it performs. It is extremely lightweight and the LED lights make it so much more enjoyable to use. Highly recommended!,2022,01
Easy setup and small for travel. Great product.,2022,01
"So disappointed. This promised to be a cute and functional mouse. But it never worked. Not even for a day. Charged it, followed all directions (I am tech proficient) and it wouldn’t even turn on. Feels cheap too so I’m not surprised. So disappointing to purchase things that don’t work. All too common anymore.",2022,01
This My Second Purchase Of This Product. So When I Need To Charge one I Have The Other One To  Use. Holds A Charge A Very Long Time  And No Cords .,2022,01
"I love the look of this mouse and it was easy to install. Unfortunately, the gold has started to peel after only a month of use. I’ve passed the return window so this is disappointing.",2022,01
Good buy. Only thing I don’t like is for connector for the upgraded usb is huge and hangs off laptop quite a bit. Otherwise was a good buy,2022,01
cheap easy to use and keeps up with your needs,2022,01
"I’ve used this product before and had no complaints. This time I purchased it, I charged it and the next day tried to use it and it wasn’t turning on at all. Tried to charge it again and the same result. Returned immediately.",2022,01
"Nothing to dislike.  I got it for my grandson, he loves it",2022,01
Excelent product,2022,01
I  am not using it for gaming but I think its cute and love the colors just wish it was a little bighter.,2022,01
The mouse does not work on a mouse pad. I can only seem to get it to work on a piece of paper and even then it’s glitchy.,2022,01
I would like to say I’m very upset and I won’t get another one like I was going to . A lot of crashes on it,2022,01
"I bought this mouse to throw in my laptop bag for those times when the trackpad was too much of a pain to use.  The mouse is slightly small in my hand, but is still comfortable and tracks well.  I really appreciate that it charges from a Micro USB cable. Great value for the price.",2022,01
"I had to update my review because I initially gave it only one star. It abruptly stopped working after 2 months BUT I realized the following day that it was actually a problem with my Mac or WiFi instead of the mouse. When I attempted to print, my Mac was also not “finding” my printer. Ooops. So, I shut down my Mac, my printer, my WiFi and when I turned everything back on, all was well. Not sure which thing caused the problem, but happily, my mouse is working fine again. No one contacted me to change my review. I was not offered anything. As a business owner, I understand how important reviews are, so when something turns out differently… we need to update our review. It’s the right thing to do.",2022,01
It keeps shaking.,2022,01
"Loved this at first, but after only a few weeks it no longer holds a charge and no longer functions.",2022,01
Worked for a few months then stopped intermittently -,2022,01
" I needed a new cheap mouse (and this was on sale) and read through a lot of reviews. I saw a lot of reviews stating that there was a chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white, allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top. Well, that sounded cool to me, so I ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same. I'm pleased to report that it does!So be warned that ordering the white version has a chance to do this, and apparently often. I find it fun though. I'm also happy to note that there is an inactivity timer on the mouse, so when not in use, it will conserve it's battery power by turning off. Clicking with the mouse will turn it back on. Battery life has been good so far too. I work from home for 8hrs a day, and it survives my work day easily. I just plug it up to charge after work.",2022,01
"I only used it once until it was dead and then I charged for hours, it wouldn't even turn on. I have tried keeping it plugged in, restarting my computer and trying the mouse on a different computer and it still doesn't work. And now, of course, it's passed the time to return or get a refund. Even though it's a cute mouse, it doesn't work and I'm frustrated. :(",2022,01
"This mouse is lightweight, easily connects and transports well for those on the go. It being rechargeable means no searching for batteries and the feel of the mouse is comfortable and not bulky. The lights are fun and you have the option to turn that on or off. All in all this is a great mouse with great value for the cost!",2022,01
Nice mouse responds well works great with my windows 11 laptop battery life is fair haven’t had it long so far it’s been good will update,2022,01
"I purchased this little over 6 months ago but used it only on the weekends on my personal laptop, so not much usage on gaming or extensive clicking.  Immediately noticed the charge does not hold up for less than 2 than 2 “weekend” days so I started turning it off. About 3 months later I noticed lagging in click response.. soon after, clicks were not engaging.. I replaced it with brand name (you get what you pay for).. but I thought I should contact the manufacturer and ask for refund or replacement… it’s been over 2 weeks now and no response. I do not recommend this product or its manufacturer. Beware!!",2022,01
Used it only for the past 3 months and it doesnt work anymore.,2022,01
It’s amazing how only good reviews can be posted but when buyers getting scammed out they hard earned money and want to complain about that the review can’t be posted.,2022,01
Good looking and works great. Love the changing lights.,2022,01
"Haven't done many reviews but think this one was worth the time. I have hands that are a bit larger than normal and feel the mouse fits well in my palm. Very silent mouse great for both office and home use without annoying those in the area. Haven't used the mouse for gaming but also haven't had any lag with the mouse as of now so could be good for that too. Overall if you are looking for a wireless mouse, good for work and home use with good connectivity, I'd highly recommend this mouse.",2022,01
"I bought this mouse thinking it would be a good mouse for my Mac. When i opened it it took many attempts to connect, and then it kept draining all of its battery every night. Do not buy this mouse its quality is very cheap. Overall bad purchase. I will be returning this",2022,01
Love it and works great. Good purchase.,2022,01
My boyfriend got me this as a gift to help with my crafting! I love this color because it goes with my cricut. I also LOVED that it came with an adapter for my MacBook Air. These newer MacBooks require adapters for anything that is not a charging port or the newer charging cords so seeing it come with an adapter is AMAZING! I don’t have to carry around my other adapter and its very easy to use. Love it!! Thank you so much for thinking of us Apple users!!,2022,01
"Great mouse for the price. Nice and soft matte feel. Very quite clicks, perfect for working in a coffee shop. Works well on mouse pads and flat surfaces. And connected to my computer instantly without needing to instal any type of software. NOTE: RGB lights are not customizable. But still cute as heck and works great!",2022,01
"The pros:Decent mouse for what I needed. I like that it is rechargeable via usb port and can be used as both wireless and wired when plugged in and recharging.The cons:These first two are mostly preferences, so take them however you wish. It sits fairly flat so there isn't much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in a mouse. This just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal preferences. Secondly, it has a silent, soft click. Normally when you click a mouse, you feel and hear the click of the button. This feels more like I am pressing on a touch screen. There is no satisfying click nor is there a sudden give in the button, rather it feels like I'm poking a couch cushion. This could be what you want in a mouse, so do with this info what you will.This last con is not based on preferences however. I found that occasionally my cursor will studder step to the left when I am moving the mouse to the right. With the dual screens I have this means that I end up with my cursor all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close a tab, or select a tool in my Adobe programs. It's nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile, but it was enough to stand out and earn it's place in this review.",2022,01
"6 months into using this mouse, it can't stay charged and can barely track.  It works okay (still doesn't track well) when plugged in, but I wanted a cordless mouse for a reason.  Definitely don't recommend this one!!",2022,01
Works great. Was a gift for my mom. She loves it,2022,01
"It's a really nice everyday mouse. The sleep mode is a little irritating because it kicks on so quickly and there doesn't seem to be a way to change it.I don't think it would be great for gaming given its limited buttons and the sleep mode thing, but it's great for office use.",2022,01
The mouse had come in a greasy package and had already been opened before I opened it myself. It had brown and black stains all over the top of the mouse and was of horrible quality. Would not recommend it to anyone looking for a mouse.,2022,01
works well with my dell laptop,2022,01
"Rechargeable, comfortable, haven't killed it yet.. I use it at work, haven't killed the battery, but I charge it overnight, lasts the day for me",2022,01
Does not work,2022,01
"If you want a cheap light-up mouse then get this one when it’s on sale, definitely not worth the $21 price otherwise. It’s very quiet and slim, but that’s about where the benefits outweigh the cost. The actual lighting is not what’s advertised, it’s actually pretty dim even in a dark room. Beyond that, whenever you move the mouse, the red laser at the bottom for tracking movement lights up the whole mouse, taking over the other colors being displayed. Additionally, with the 2 hour charge time and the usb needed for connectivity, you’d be better off buying a nicer mouse for the same price",2022,01
It is a pretty color and works great! I highly recommend this product!,2022,01
The laser is sporadic. Mouse icon jumps around randomly..,2022,01
 I keep it plugged in and I also connected the USB to my laptop but I’m not sure if I have to charge all the time LOL it doesn’t bother me but I love this mouse!,2022,01
"It won’t turn on anymore, I only used it for 3 weeks. It’s a rip off don’t get it. It’s on as you see but won’t actually turn on.",2022,01
I never use the mouse before it works for me,2022,01
"Does right after charging. Didn't quite work right out of the box, had to turn on rainbow led light to even get it to work, will not work without that turned on. Now it won't hold a charge for more than 5 minutes. After maybe 2 weeks.",2022,01
It is comfortable to use. The changing colors add visual interest,2022,01
"Good price, cool lights, conveniently comes with a USB to USB-C adapter!",2022,01
Very lightweight and easy to use! Highly recommend this product. Changing leds really make it a more enjoyable experience. I would definitely repurchase again in the future! Awesome customer service.,2022,01
Worked for two days then stopped. Don’t buy it,2022,01
"I liked it a lot for the first few days - I mean, it’s a cheap mouse, but it was pretty decent. On day 3, it just stopped working. No amount of charging would turn that sucker back on. Probably shouldn’t expect much more from a $10 mouse - guess I’ll just consider it a $5-a-day mouse rental.",2022,01
 So colorful and bright. Moves with ease. Very happy with my product,2022,01
The scroll up and down is not working at all. I tried everything and its not working. Looks like it’s defective or used they send me.,2022,01
"Nice looking, quiet, works well.",2022,01
Dislike,2022,01
"I used it for my school chrome book, and all of a sudden it fell of my desk , and it broke.",2022,01
"Okay performance while it worked. But definitely won't buy it again, and would not recommend it to others.",2022,01
Love how slim it is and battery free charge like a cell phone and the beautiful colors that surrounds the mouse is outstanding,2022,01
Unfortunately it's been 6 months and now it's useless and unresponsive. Going to have to get rid of it now and get a new one. I guess you get what you pay for.,2022,01
I work on 2 computers all day!!! This mouse has easily become my favorite mouse. I use it for all of my computer tasks on both computers! Love this mouse!!! Very sleek!!!!,2022,01
"This mouse is true to its description in that it's silent and ergonomic, but it wasn't worth the money for me--I bought it in April 2021, and had to throw it out in January 2022. Around November of 2021, I started experiencing issues with charging, where I'd have to wriggle the cord around before it would start charging. By January, it was clear that there was an issue not with the charging cable, but with the charging port in the mouse. It was loose and wiggly when I held the mouse up, and it would only charge if I held the mouse in my hand and kept the charger pressed in tightly. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a cute mouse.",2022,01
"I really enjoy the mouse with the different colors that light up. When clicking the left or right buttons on the mouse, it is very quiet.",2022,01
I grabbed this because I was having difficulty with my mouse pad on my laptop. But it's great I love how compact it is and it hasn't had any issues since I bought it (like 2 years ago),2022,01
"I use this exclusively for my raspberry pis, and it works great. Love that the dongle sits under the mouse itself, makes it easy to bring with me everywhere.",2022,01
"It is a nice mouse, and I liked that it came with an adapter for the macbook. However, the adapter did not work which made the mouse unusable. The adapter seems flimsy and cheap. Luckily I had an adapter and the mouse now works fine. If you are buying this for a mac I would recommend investing in a good adapter.",2022,01
"At first I loved this mouse. The charging time is short, the lights are nice and it worked perfectly. The adapter never worked but I looked past it since I bought a USB adapter for my Mac. Now the mouse acts like it’s dying and won’t have a good connection. It now will not charge properly. I’m so disappointed because I initially loved it. I’ve only had it since a little under a month ago. I’m so upset I wasted my money on this. Now I have to buy another mouse.",2022,01
Received a first time and it was not working. Exchanged and the mouse started acting up after a few weeks.,2022,01
The mouse worked fine at first. Then the battery stopped holding charge for a long time. After 3 month it stopped working completely.,2022,01
This mouse stopped working one month in despite being charged and taken to my company’s tech desk to be looked at to see if I was the problem.,2022,01
"Cute and comfortable design, but quit working after a month. Save your money.",2022,01
Smooth operation.,2022,01
It lights up very pretty but is very laggy. Doesn’t track very good with cursor. I can’t deal with that since I use mine for work so I switched back to the mouse my company sent me.,2022,01
Worked literally for a couple of minutes then stopped. Probably wouldn't trust it with your apple products.,2022,01
"It was working fine at first, I always kept it charged, but after a few months it just completely stopped working. When I try to turn it on it just flashes red and turns itself off. I tried charging, changing the USB ports, and still nothing. Waste of money!!",2022,01
"I was looking at this mouse when my cat jumped on my lap and hit the ""buy now"" button. Turned out to be a pretty good mouse. True story. But, she can't write reviews, so she may be a little disappointed",2022,01
"Came fast, no set up required just plug in and go. The kids in my classroom love the light up feature.",2022,01
I don't use this every day. It's less than two years old and already time for replacement. The wire casing at the connection point is cracked and internal wires are exposed. Works great but should have lasted longer.,2022,01
"I bought this mouse twice because I wasn't able to return them in time due to mailing issues. I thought the first one must be an error, since it broke after 4 hours of use. Guess how long the second mouse lasted? 3 hours. Absolute crap product and I wasted my money",2022,01
Cool item. Easy to set up. Very pretty.,2022,01
After one month the mouse would not stay turned on even though it appeared to be fully charged.  I will not buy rechargable again,2022,01
works great and the 3 dpi does all i need it too,2022,01
Works perfectly for my MacBook!! Sleek design with cool lights! Would 100% buy again,2022,01
I’ve been using this mouse for a couple of months to do online schooling and now in person classes as well. Haven’t had any problems. Lights make it cute. Works for all I need it to.,2022,01
"Bought two of these; one for work and one for my personal computer, in two different colors. Mouse worked great until the roller ball in each died. One after a couple months, one after less than two days. If you can live without the roller ball, then I highly recommend. But if you use it heavily, I would look at a different mouse.",2022,01
love the color affects,2022,01
I charge this mouse for an entire day and it lasts for 2 minutes. It is awful and I can tell that many other people feel this way but have gotten money to delete their review. I plan on throwing this out immediately and buying an actual rechargeable mouse,2022,01
I have gotten so many compliments on this mouse! first off the rose gold color is so beautiful and dainty! when i first started using i fell in love that in changes colors and has the capability to turn off! highly recommend! great price as well!,2022,01
"Great fit, compact but very responsive.",2022,01
It is really quiet and colorful.,2022,01
"The scroll wheel on the mouse broke after less than a week of using it. I liked the mouse before that. It was easy to setup, comfortable to use, and the colors look nice. I really liked the silent mouse click. But now that I can’t scroll with the mouse I will need to buy a new one",2022,01
It did not work I ended up returning it.,2022,01
It looks nice & lights up. Difficult to use since it freezes up the computer & for some odd reason will even knock off my bluetooth headphones. Do not waste your $,2022,01
Kept “skipping”. Wouldn’t track properly although right next to iPad,2022,01
Doesn’t recharge and the arrow on my screen moves very choppy and jumps around so half the time I can’t click on what I want.,2022,01
Sleek and reliable,2022,01
Best mouse I have ever used. Very smooth and really sharp looking.,2022,01
I really liked the color and look of the mouse but the scroll never worked even after fully charging it.,2022,01
I have a MacBook and this mouse required two plugins...since I take my Mac with me the chances of these 2 plugins being lost was a pain....,2022,01
It was a good mouse while it lasted but died on me suddenly 5 months after purchasing. Purchased 7/15/2021 and died 1/19/2922,2022,01
"Super sad because I was obsessed with this mouse but it has already stopped working after one month. Super frustrating, should had just gone to Best Buy originally.",2022,01
For one this mouse is not compatible with the c adapter and not worth the price by giving false information about the device. Update it and see why the c adapter isn't working or remove this item.,2022,01
"Nice looking mouse, beautiful colors, and comfortable hold for any sized hands.The battery on this thing is surprising, charging does take time, but seriously, that won't be a problem because this thing can last long.I do suggest turning this off to make sure the battery doesn't drain, sleep mode is brilliant but do turn it off so you won't get caught off guard for when It does lose battery.",2022,01
"I followed instructions for charging and tried a few different methods, but could never get this to power on or work. The company was great to quickly refund it, though.",2022,01
The mouse falls asleep right away. The cord for recharging is only about 4 in 5 in long. Constantly needs to be recharged.  It is definitely not a five-star product.It looks cool.,2022,01
"Be ready to turn it on and off every 2 mins of non-use, the thing goes into sleep mode then is sluggish in its response time till you restart it.  not something I would reccomend",2022,01
Works great long battery life love that it turns itself off very smooth used,2022,01
"It's a cute mouse, I like the colors, and it's ergonomic. However, I've only had it for a little over 6 months and the scroll wheel just came loose and stopped working. I've never had that happen with a mouse, so it's not the best quality in the world.",2022,01
"This mouse will randomly move the cursor all over the screen every once in a while. Not going to bother returning it because it was so cheap, but I have stopped using it. I bought two and they both have this issue.",2022,01
My mouse broke in just four days.  Waist of money!,2022,01
The crazy mouse will not hold a charge. I have to plug it in after 30 minutes of use. Defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse. My alkaline battery mouse would last for months and then just a simple battery replacement. Do not buy!,2022,01
Comfortable to use,2022,01
It is so pretty. The lights are gorgeous. I love that it is rechargeable BUT the roller in the middle broke and I haven't even had it for 3 months. I use it for work so it doesn't get a lot of use either.,2022,01
"Till now this LED wireless rechargeable mouse is one of the items I am glad to have invested in. It is easy to use, very light and fits just right in the palm of my hand... It has a very nice modern look and is also affortable... Thank you seller for the quick delivery and aftersale communication...",2022,01
The micro-USB to USB-C adapter does not work. You are better off ordering a mouse that connects directly to the computer via direct bluetooth (that does not need a receiver),2022,01
"Once I got this product I read the manual and did everything step by step including charging the mouse, and it will not work! After 5 minutes of messing with it the LED lights started flashing and I got it to work for a little while then it stopped again! This product is not good and I needed it for school, but I would hate to take an exam and i have these issues!",2022,01
"Works fine but it feels like a toy a kid would use. Super light and made with a thin, cheap plastic",2022,01
This mouse works really well. The only thing is I don’t feel like the battery lasts very long. I use it for work and those are 8 hour days of non stop computer work. I only get about 4-5 days of use before I have to recharge again.,2022,01
It lasted last than 2 months!,2022,01
Excelente,2022,01
"Very good, reliable mouse.  I was not disappointed.",2022,01
"Works well , but son broke within a week.  Dropped it and it shattered.",2022,01
"Loved the product look and that it was rechargeable, however the battery didn’t hold the charge long enough for the device to properly connect via Bluetooth so you had to leave it plugged in which defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse. Also the shape for the mouse provided little comfort as it caused my palm to cramp after two days of use. Returning item and going back to Logitech brand.",2022,01
I bought this for home office and I liked it so much I bought a second one for work to use instead of what the company supplied to me.  It’s everything the description says it is.  Very comfortable too!,2022,01
"I needed a new mouse for my laptop. I decided to wire less a must and rechargeable.  This fits all my needs, plus a an automatic setup.",2022,01
The mouse won't charge anymore... I put it on charger for hours and when my daughter trys to use it all it does is flash red and doesn't work... so much for her Christmas present,2022,01
Loved it!!!!,2022,01
Fits my hand perfect. Like the lites and the sleep mode to save battery life.,2022,01
"I like it being rechargeable, comes with USB cord for easy rechargingLights can be turned off if you don't want to use them or to save battery charge.Overall it's a good mouse for the price.",2022,01
"As title suggests: easy maneuverability, responsive, and ""lower"" than my previous mouse.",2022,01
"Simple, lightweight, easy to use. I love the LED lighting that flickers when in use so you know if it’s in sleep mode. The top coat finish is terrible…full of dust/debris…not smooth.",2022,01
I was saddened when the product didn’t work at all. My kids needed a new wireless mouse and they did everything they were supposed to do and it didn’t work at all. Will not be buying again.,2022,01
"I bought this mouse for college and I received it promptly. I opened the package and plugged it into my computer and it worked kinda. The next morning I tried to use it in class and it would not work. I thought maybe that this mouse was dead, so I charged it and it will not charge and will not work. This MOUSE IS A TERRIBLE PRODUCT DO NOT BUY!!!!!",2022,01
Sleek and works great,2022,01
"I'm so happy that I purchased this mouse. It's sleek and it's easy to use. I enjoy the light component, it adds uniqueness. The mouse is light weight. The USB chip is easy to keep up with because it fits in a small space underneath the mouse. That way the chip never gets lost. I also like the idea that I can charge the mouse and I never have to worry about an internal battery malfunctioning. I highly recommend this mouse for purchase.",2022,01
"Has worked well for over a year now (bought 10/2020). Light still glows, no issues with the function. I don't game or anything so it's had light use. It has a surprising amount of battery.",2022,01
"At first, it was great, however, after a few months, it just stopped working...disappointing.",2022,01
Worked fine for about 6 months then wouldn’t charge again after it died.,2022,01
"Ordered this for my new laptop, works like a charm. includes a charging cable, adapter, and usb receiver that can be stored in the bottom of the mouse. the colors light up very nicely and customer support was lovely (contacted them about activating warranty). my only issue with this mouse is the shape, which was more flat than the mice I'm used to using, but that is just personal preference and I got used to it very quickly. overall great product.",2022,01
I like how it is,2022,01
"Battery life seems to be decent. I have two of these and both have issues with the DPI randomly changing itself so I have to click the button to change it numerous times a day. Every now and then the one I use at home doesn't 'connect' when turning on the computer. I have to unplug/re-plug the dongle. I do have it plugged into a USB switch, but seeing as it's the only device that encounters this issue I don't believe the problem is the switch. Not likely to buy this again, it's been too frustrating.",2022,01
"Unfortunately, the item doesn't recharge after just two weeks of use.  Disappointing product.",2022,01
"It is nice, easy to use. I love it!",2022,01
Another piece of China junk sold through Amazon.  Charged until the light went off (mouse charged).  Plugged it in and it stopped working minutes later.  Did the same thing a second time … same result.  Thanks Amazon for continuing to peddle garbage products to your customers.,2022,01
it doesn’t work,2022,01
"Died within the first month of use.  Nice mouse, I wanted to use it instead of the trackpad on the laptop.  Too bad it didn't work for long.",2022,01
"I got this wireless mouse for my daughter because she was getting tired of using the old wired mouse for playing games on the PC.  So far her experience with it has been great, the size was perfect for her average teen hand and she's a lefty.  The main avantage was the mouse was rechargable so we don't have to worry about replacing the battery every so offten, a plus for me.",2022,01
"I purchased this mouse for home office.I don’t have a glass table, but I guess surface is too smooth for it to work.Silent operation, very comfortable.Battery lasts a decent time.Lasted for a week straight without turning it off.Not returning it but not super happy with the issue.",2022,01
Standard wireless mouse. Works well.  What I really like about it is the colored light at the sides.  :),2022,01
I purchase this mouse for my kid. He had an old one using batteries only. He is frustrated by replacing batteries so frequently (every 2 weeks). I like the feature including rechargeable and charge when you use it. It really creates a big convenience for children. Now he can stop looking for the new batteries around the house.,2022,01
"I haven’t used it a lot, but the mouse will no longer scroll. The mouse is also not very comfortable.",2022,01
This mouse is quiet when clicking. As described,2022,01
"Ordered shortly after Christmas and once arrived I had issues connecting, after realizing my only route to get it to work was to constantly turn the mouse on and off. After less than a week and one charge it will no longer do anything. No lights, no power, no connection and won't charge with the included cord or any other. Spend the money on a different brand this was like ordering from wish.",2022,01
"Fits in my big hands nicely, with the mouse wheel having a non sleep feel.I bought two of these, one for my work laptop and one for my personal laptop. Not too long afterwards, one of the BT dongles went AWOL. The seller sent me a replacement which for me sealed the deal as a good investment/purchase. Of course the LED colors were icing on the cake so to speak.",2022,01
Love it!,2022,01
"I really liked this mouse - very convenientHowever, I bought it less that 2 months ago and the wheel stopped workingVery disappointed",2022,01
Ugh! Can't return since outside my return window ...stopped working!,2022,01
" The mouse is low profiled, easy to use. It connects instantly and is ready to use as soon as you plug the adapter into your computer.It is very comfortable to use. And the video shows it’s extra cool light show.",2022,01
Sorry. Usually I dont leave bad reviews but this one takes the cake. It started working at first but then it started to be very laggy and then no longer worked. Now.. i am using a brand new MACBOOK so maybe it's the USB converter that might be a problem. But currently not a fan.,2022,01
"The texture is very good to hold, and mostly very quiet. I feel very good about this shopping experience, the shipment was very fast, and it arrived much earlier than expected.",2022,01
"Stopped working, stopped chargi, stopped lighting up!Contacted customer service and they sent out a replacement that showed up 2 days late.New one? We shall see!",2022,01
Love it would recommend works great love that it’s light and can’t hear when you click the mouse lights are very cute,2022,01
Loved this product but the scroll recently stopped working and I must turn it off and on during use..,2022,01
"Small, lightweight yet firm solid feel. Led lighting is a nice touch. Shuts off automatically once laptop or pc is shutdown. However the main reason I purchased was because of the silent feature. Sadly it's not as silent as I had hoped. Clicks are still audible especially on scroll wheel which is disappointing. Why cant someone make a truly silent mouse? I have yet to find one as most ""silent"" mice are merely muffled by a rubber lining. Shame, would be perfect otherwise",2022,01
"This was my second purchase. I bought one in June and it worked fine. The charging port metal ""liner"" part fell out, so it couldn't be charged. I got another and used it for about an hour without any problems. I charged it, used it for another 2-3 hours, then it just suddenly quit. When I turn it off and on again, the red lights flash once then nothing. Completely useless.",2022,01
Love it,2022,01
The motion is glitchy. Sometime it moves very slow. I tried different surfaces and it didn't help.  It also goes to sleep even though I took sleep mode off.,2022,01
I have to say I'm impressed. Not only does it light up but I accidentally dropped it in a dog bowl full of water and it still works!!! Can't ask for more than that for the price.,2022,01
"This mouse is amazing, it is ergonomic, cheap and functional. Defenitly a great choice for business.For games I don't have an opinion cause I don't play computer games.",2022,01
"I travel a lot & wanted a slim, light mouse for work and school. This mouse is perfect, it’s fully charged in 3 hours, slim, comfortable to use for hours, & when fully charged it can last for days. Also the changing light affect is pretty cool. I definitely recommend this mouse for someone who either works from home or is a college student :))",2021,12
It was nice while it lasted. Unfortunately for me that was less than three months...,2021,12
I charged the mouse overnight and it died within 15 minutes of using it. Tried to charge it again and it will not charge. Threw out the box so I can’t return it.,2021,12
"Just plug and play.  So easy to use and very sleek and slim looking. I like it when the light lid up.  Its soo cool! This is my 1st rechargeable mouse.  I really like it!  I am going to try it for a month and if it work well, I will buy another one.",2021,12
No computer mouse was amazing,2021,12
So bad quality and uncomfortable,2021,12
"I purchased this item for a MacbookPRO but it does not work as promised. I tried to return but DHL will charge me USD 52.96 and Amazon only cover 20 usd, So I resigne to return",2021,12
"This is one of the most comfortable and user friendly mouses I have used. The sleek design makes for a easy rest on your wrist and responds easily and effortlessly. Best feature, it seeps if not used so it saves on the charge. Last for a good use.",2021,12
Nice mouse for a few months of light use. After that it would not take a charge even tried swapping cables. Big disappointment,2021,12
I’ve had this mouse for less than a month and it’s already glitching out moving the curser without me moving the actual mouse. Cool colors though,2021,12
"I needed a new mouse for my laptop and decided on this design based on its ergonomics.  However, I’m used to the taller mouse so it took some getting used to this design.  I’m not completely sold on it, but I’ll give it a go.",2021,12
"I've been using it for less than 2 hours, and my wrist is already quite sore. There is no ergometric support whatsoever. And are all the lights really necessary? I find them annoying.",2021,12
love my led light up mouse. it's very quiet. and no more clicking noise. yay!!!!! thanks. Amazon,2021,12
Great product!,2021,12
A sweet ergonomic mouse with good responses.,2021,12
"Got a good deal. Nice item, was exactly as described.",2021,12
I wish it had a way to let me know when it needs to be recharged. I like how quiet it is and the lights are just fun.,2021,12
Only used it a few times and I like it.,2021,12
"The mouse works fine. It is slim, kind of cheap plastic, but the lights - which in photos look like it would just be a thin line around the mouse - are very annoying. The entire thing lights up. You can not turn them off and still use the mouse, it is very distracting. I did not try to return it because there is nothing else wrong, but I will donate it to charity or someone. Ordered another one with no lights!",2021,12
Used for 6 months and now it won't charge.,2021,12
"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. For a “wireless” and “rechargeable” mouse it sure didn’t get the memo. It refuses to work without being plugged in, we’ve let it charge over night and everything. Would not recommend.",2021,12
Very good mouse. I'd recommend.,2021,12
Felt cheap. Returned for a better product,2021,12
"So cute and ergonomic, holds the charge really well probably due to its auto sleep mode and works like a charm!",2021,12
"I hated using this mouse. It was beautiful and matched the color of my laptop perfectly, but I couldn't get the cursor to move smoothly. I adjusted the setting on my laptop but ultimately ended up getting a different mouse, which worked perfectly.",2021,12
"Mouse doesn't track well.  It's also really flat and doesn't feel good in my hand. Wish it had a battery, rather that cord, or at least a battery backup. There is a hard notch right below the when, I don't know what it's for, bit it's uncomfortable and gets in the way of using the wheel.  Want to return, but I tossed the box it came in.",2021,12
It's  a good size for the work it does. Great price,2021,12
Out of the package my initial thoughts were that the product seemed very cheaply made and those thoughts were confirmed when after one month of use the product stopped working. Would not recommend this product.,2021,12
"It works fine however, sometimes it does not response when you move your hand. I also do not recognize when the DPI is activated or not. Also, when you click the bottom, it does not response so you have to press it more than one time for it works. Also, it is felt very plastic.",2021,12
Won’t work at all!,2021,12
Definitely worth the money,2021,12
"Ergonomically I find it to be too short and a bit uncomfortable. I bought it as a travel mouse so I could over look that, except that it barely works. Every time I have tried to use it it eventually gets super laggy and almost impossible to use. Turning it off and on again fixes it but only until it starts to lag again.",2021,12
"easy to use, charge lasts a long time",2021,12
"Really great mouse and affordable to buy and its mouse click is super smooth , i love it so much",2021,12
"Too flat, hard to use",2021,12
"It broke, the mouse is unresponsive the wheel is isolated. It is inconvenient having to charge the mouse every few uses through a cable. It 1",2021,12
Currently returning this product. Even after adjusting several things on it this mouse just doesn't do the job. Hard to click so when you do get a click in it's not where you wanted it.,2021,12
Didn’t work from the minute I opened it. Don’t waste your money.,2021,12
" This mouse is super cute, however its made out of all plastic and it stopped working. I tried using 6 different chargers including its own. I've left it charging for a few hours and nothing! Super disappointed.",2021,12
"I plugged it in to charge for 4 hours, the moment I unplugged it, it wouldn't turn on and wouldn't connect to my laptop. but if it was plugged in, it worked and connected. I wanted a wireless mouse, not something that needed to be plugged into a charger to work. im working from home on a laptop and wanted something that worked but now I have to wait longer for a mouse that actually works.",2021,12
"I liked the look, feel, and price of this mouse. However, after less than 3 months of moderate use, while playing a game, I clicked the ""wheel"" and it broke. This item was not made to last. Cheap and not worth the money in my opinion.",2021,12
"I had this mouse before without the LED lights, worked like a charm. But despite this version that says the LED lights are able to turn off...they DON'T. The switch on the bottom to shut off the lights do not work, the ""ON"" button shuts off the whole mouse instead of just the lights. So basically I'm stuck with annoying flashing lights.",2021,12
"It's really nice, exactly what I wanted except when it changes in light it does automatically and the transition is a bit glitchy at times ,but i still love it.",2021,12
This was a Christmas gift and the recipient was thrilled to death when gift was opened. I was given a demonstration soon after gift was opened. Looked great with the changing colors of the device.,2021,12
"Light weight, very easy to use, charging lasts for long, I like that it has the usb attachment in mouse making it perfect for travel",2021,12
"Overall, I really liked the mouse. I enjoyed the colors and the feel of it was very nice. The main problem I had is that I specifically bought it for work for my Mac laptop. The adapter didn't work at all. I had to keep holding it down at a specific angle in order to use it at all. Very disappointing......",2021,12
"I only used this mouse for a short while, but it works very well. I was able to connect it using the USB transmitter very easily.  It does what it is supposed to do",2021,12
"When I bought it expecting it to last more than a month, then last week I noticed something wasn't right. Sure enough the end oof the wire that plugs into the PC was breaking ..and I really was happy with it at first not having to buy batteries for it..",2021,12
"The color is spot on.It is ergonomic and more flat than arched.Sometimes I think it is too wide, but yet it's not.The price was right, the color choices were great.Overall happy that I found this mouse.It was for my Apple laptop as it didn't have one and  hated not having a mouse to navigate",2021,12
Like the quick response the mouse has.  Lights up and easy to manuever.  Love it.,2021,12
"I'm happy with my purchase! It wasn't an expensive mouse, it's wireless and rechargeable, all things I was looking for. It is a slim mouse which took some time for me to get used to. I only use it for office work tasks so I can't speak to other uses. However I don't notice any lags, delays or other issues. I do wish there was some way to control the colors but it's not a big deal. Also the top clear button clicks but I haven't figured out what that does.",2021,12
Doesn’t hold charge for very long. Has dead spots have to shake to get to move sometime,2021,12
Has a nice feel to it. Very smooth and responsive. Like the changing lights around the edge. Very colorful.,2021,12
This item is trash. Do not waste your money. I have only been able to use the mouse once without issue. Just do not work at all now.,2021,12
I loved this mouse until it stopped working after about a month of use. It is plugged in and charging but is not responding to movement after about ten minutes. I’ve tried multiple ports and turning it on and off but the thing won’t respond. It’s illuminating in just blue which it’s never done before. Don’t buy it,2021,12
"Works fine, nothing special and not quite as smooth as standard mouses you can get at big box stores for $25",2021,12
Hard to install. Gave up on its use.,2021,12
"I'm going back to basic and battery operated.  Lost charge at inconvenient times. then started being temperamental on taking a charge.  Now it won't take a charge at all. Worthless to me, waste of time and money!",2021,12
"The design and color is awesome ! I also bought this product for my b/f as well, and would definitly recommend this product to family and friends.  There is nothing to dislike about this product",2021,12
Worked effortlessly right out of the boxAnd the shipping was lightning fast,2021,11
I purchased this with the hope to use it for my home office to get rid of my corded mouse. I was very surprised when I was scrolling and all of the sudden the scroller seemed to sink deeper into the mouse. I took it apart in hopes to fix it only to find that the scroller just snapped off.,2021,12
"This product only lights up in red. Not multi colored as described or shown. Other than that that, it’s okay.",2021,12
Left button not working after 4 months…for $15 not worth it…save you money and look for a better one the last.,2021,12
This is the second time I’ve replaced this mouse and after being fully charged the power doesn’t come on. Will never buy again!The product support is nonexistent!,2021,12
Very lightweight and I like the looks of it but the right click button stopped working after a few months,2021,12
Great use,2021,12
I bought this at the end of August 2021 and it worked great until now. Now it won't hold a charge and I can't return it because it has been over the time. Very disappointed.,2021,12
"This mouse is prettt okay. It works fine and lights up pretty, which is a bonus. I’m not a fan of the feeling of clicking, though. I wish I bought a different mouse for that reason. But I will hold onto it for now.",2021,12
no one problem so far it works perfectly and the look is amazing,2021,12
"I bought this mouse to replace an older one that had just cracked.  I love the feature of charging them by USB in place of batteries.  So much more convenient.  Easy to setup, mouse clicks are completely silent which is also a nice feature.  The changing led color light on the inside is just a bonus that makes it looks cool.  Comfortable use, slim design and really like the no-slip material of the mouse.",2021,12
"I was searching for Bluetooth mouse. I found one, but didn't like the color. When I changed to the silver one, some how it switched off of Bluetooth.It is wireless and did work with the USB dongle.The buttons are quiet and the movement was smooth.Unfortunately I have a MAC and the USB ports are only USB-C. The mouse does come with an adapter, but this makes it stick out far and will get damaged.I had to return it.",2021,12
Mouse takes a long time to connect and I spend way to long to try to make it work. It got here fast though,2021,12
"Very sleek design, bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. It connected easily to his chromebook and the lights are pretty cool.",2021,12
"love the color changing led lights, easy to use, easy to charge. lets see how long it last",2021,12
Tested this out after charging it. So far so good.,2021,12
OMG what a piece of crap can't right clock seriously. Looks great & did like the slimmer line of it too bad don't work.,2021,12
"When I received this product the first time, it had come broken. The entire click pad was nearly separated from the base and couldn’t easily be snapped back into place. I sent in for a replacement and everything was all fine! They sent a replacement no problems. This was in April.Flash forward to December, a mere eight months. The mechanism that holds the scroll wheel somehow snapped apart and the scroll wheel is now 100% useless, which makes playing games a bit difficult, as many games use the scroll wheel. When to contact customer service? All contact is closed.Use caution when ordering this mouse. At first, the replacement I had been sent was good, despite it not exactly having any sort of indicator as to when the mouse needed to be charged; but if the scroll wheel’s mechanisms are gonna snap easily under potentially hard gaming sessions? Perhaps pass for something more heavy duty.",2021,12
Purchased for a Imac compter.  Seamless setup and operation.,2021,12
I ❤  not buying batteries!,2021,12
Don’t buy,2021,12
"This is a really great mouse; it works as designed.  Unfortunately, I don't have the patience for the very slow response time. It was aggravating waiting for it to respond to my finger commands. Needless to say, I got rid of it and bought something different.",2021,12
its just not good at all. the colors don't show as good as shown. It does not connect to MacBook and the mouse tracking his slow and horrible,2021,12
I love this mouse. It has a cute and ergonomic design and doesn’t need to be charged often. The only thing I don’t like about the matte black one is that it shows fingerprints easily.,2021,12
I've had this mouse for almost a month now and it's great quality and works awesome stays charged for a while I've only had to change it once and I use it for working at home several hours a day! Definitely recommend ! I got the pink one and it's so cute!!,2021,12
"Not only does this feel like the cheapest mouse I have ever had the displeasure of holding, the USB type C adapter is a loose fitting piece of junk.  Not even worth the hassle of returning.  This piece of garbage only flashes red for a second then quits doing anything else (even after being charged for 8 hours).  I have attached it to 4 different devices and nothing.  I guess you get what you pay for and I this instance...JUNK",2021,12
"Disappointed with this product, stops tracking after a few seconds of usage regardless of how I have it charged. Faulty product 👎🏽",2021,12
I like how sleak it is the sleep mode helps the battery life it seems to recharge pretty fast and work on almost any surface I'm happy with it and will be ordering more for my DVR!,2021,12
Worked okay for a little while but then it became glitchy so bought one that plugs in Works a little bit better for now,2021,12
Great,2021,11
"My previous mouse wheel stopped working. I love the shape, slim design of this mouse. The lights are pretty cool. It is so nice, if I forget to turn off, it goes to sleep. Very reactive. It is a Perfect replacement.UPDATE: only lasted 2 months. Now the pointer is not controllable. I have tried everything I can think of. Thought it was my laptop. Started using computer pad and the issue is not there. It is the mouse. Very disappointed so I am changing my review.",2021,12
I liked the sleep mode. Price is reasonable. I also liked the shape.,2021,12
Bought this for my kiddos laptop. She likes the lights and the almost weightless feeling. It was a good buy for the price and works great so far.,2021,12
Works as described. Nice design and functionality. Highly recommend.,2021,12
"So, I do like that the mouse fits well in my hand. Is very responsive and works very well for everyday use. I like that the mouse click is very quiet. I have had NO problems with the mouse so far. I would recommend this mouse as it works very well and you can also adjust the sensitivity, or how fast it tracks by adjusting the DPI. Nice feature to have.",2021,12
These stop working after a short while. Bought 4. They all have been returned. Spend a couple bucks more and buy a different unit,2021,12
"Mouse is nice, I thought there was an option to not have it light up since I don't need that function but the 3 options are off, one color, and alternating many colors. It only lights up while you are moving it and the light is off when its still. Glides good, clicks well. My only really issue with it is the scroller wheel can be a little unreliable, if i want to scroll down just a line or two it won't move and then if i scroll just a little faster it zooms down the page. Overall decent",2021,12
"its a cool little mouse, got it for work reasons like the RGB on it. works as intended. not really pricey.",2021,12
"This mouse works well and is easily rechargeable and portable. I wouldn’t recommend using it for gaming, but it’s perfect if you need a wireless mouse to take with your laptop.",2021,12
"Update 4.2.22: I tried charging more often and making sure I turned it off. Seems it doesn't last as long as I'd hoped. Switched back to battery operated Bluetooth mouse.Worked well for the time being. I bought 2 and the other is still working, for now. As of now, I've tried to use it on notebook, tablet, and desktop to ensure it's a connection issue. Maybe it's the battery, but I'm not sure. If sleep mode is active, the battery shouldn't be having issues in such a brief time of having it. It should last a few days after a full charge (overnight).",2021,12
Love the mouse my only downfall is that it’s very light and I’m used to a little heavier one so it’s something to get used too.,2021,12
1,2021,12
The mouse no matter how much I charge it no longer turns on or connects to my computer. I normally try to avoid making negative reviews but this is honestly not worth the money I spent on this. All I wanted was a mouse to help me work on my Macbook and this was just a huge disappointment.,2021,12
"I purchased this to replace a broken battery operated cordless mouse.  I think I dropped it one too many times. I thought I would give this rechargeable mouse a try. I hope that I won't have to recharge it too often.  I only had to do the initial charge so far, and I do a lot of clicking. I also chose this one for its flatter design.  My other one was higher, and after using it a long time my hand got stiff.  Maybe this one won't do that. So far it hasn't.",2021,12
Only worked a few weeks and thats it. Waste of money. Whats worse is I barely used it.,2021,12
The mouse only worked if it was plugged in not at all wireless like it says,2021,12
"So... my review after using this mouse for 2 months:- there are a lot of glitches that makes the cursor on screen jump from one area to another- the mouse STOPS WORKING in the middle even after making sure it is fully charged. You have to turn off the mouse, put the mouse on charge for an hour to get the mouse to start working again. I will not recommend this mouse to ANYONE!!!!- Couple days later... the mouse has completely stopped working and there's no customer service response.Update: The mouse is still not working. I have made three attempts so far to reach out to the company, but they don't respond. The quality of customer service: 0.Update 2. It’s been over 8 months since I got the replacement… even the replacement is horrible. It stops responding. The action time is delayed. When you left click… it doesn’t respond. This is even after I carefully keep the mouse.",2021,12
I have had this mouse for a while now. I love it! It's perfect size and the color change is probably my favorite part. I don't have to recharge it everyday but I really only use it for work. so I work an 8 hour day again it really doesn't need to be charged often. When it's time for a charge the color will start to shift to red. Everyone that's seen it has asked where I got it and that they want one!,2021,12
I bought 2 of these back in October for me and my mom. After a month and and a half of regular use for mine it no longer works. I thought I wasn't charging it enough until I opened my mom's. Hers brand new out the box did not work either. Very very disappointed. I will not be purchasing again. Do not but it isn't worth it.,2021,12
"This mouse was very useful and relatively enjoyable the first week and a half. At two weeks, it seemed to glitch. The cursor would jerk and freeze. So I connected the mouse to the charger. It was ok for a couple of days, but sadly succumbed to its cheapness this afternoon.Very cheaply made product. Maybe those 4/5 star reviews are bought?  Very disappointing.",2021,12
Loved this mouse and the battery last pretty long,2021,12
"So I teach prek and we have nap time. What caught my attention was the quiet clicker. I didn’t think it would be as quiet as it is, but it is extremely quiet. It’s also easy to set up and easy to use!",2021,12
"Positive quality, great color",2021,12
"I bought this 3 month ago was working perfectly fine until last week then for no reason it stop working properly. It's not responsive ,the cursor move does not match the movements of my hand and I can no longer use it.I just ordered another mouse from other brands",2021,12
"Good for the price, tracks kind of poorly and the LED colors are not great",2021,12
Easy for my 10 year old to set up and use. After 2 weeks the wheel broke.,2021,12
"It's extremely uncomfortable to use. Maybe if you're on a trip and need something to do the job, this will work.Definitely not for daily use, gaming, or work.",2021,12
Good gaming mouse . I use it to play game!,2021,12
"A very well-made mouse, responsive with no lag. Only issue is the lack of adaptability. No buttons so all procedures are what manufacturer has set in. I like the wireless operation and the lack of batteries.",2021,12
"I thought I was getting a better mouse by splurging on the more expensive option, but I guess that doesn't seem to matter.I would think I'd get a decent working product for 13 bucks but I guess that also doesn't seem to be a thing.Save yourself the trouble of thinking this is quality product and actually buy a mouse that works. I have had all similar issues of not working after about a month of use. I'm a broke college student and really wish I could have saved myself time and money.",2021,12
I just wanted a colorful mouse and this is what I expected. Its okay in ergonomics but I do not know much about ergonomics. Its okay for gaming but its not the best since its more of a office type mouse.,2021,12
"Truly a mediocre mouse, yes it lights up in different color but everything about this mouse is mediocre.  Cheap feel, the scroll does not work very well, the click is not very good, movement of actual mouse is not smooth.  Don't be taken in by the pictures....trust the previous poor reviews.",2021,12
"I was a bit skeptical about it being a “quiet” clicker but was pleased to learn it really is quiet. The clicks are greatly muffled and are soft to the…click. My only complaint is that the scrolling wheel does not click quietly.The lights are enjoyable but don’t display a constant stream of colors as they forcibly/manually change when moved or clicked. They otherwise will rotate when the mouse is left idle.Overall, it’s a really nice mouse to buy and use. Comfortable and light—kind of reminds me of the Apple mouse.",2021,12
"I loved this mouse.  I used it for a few hours of office work once every week or two.  So very light use in the scheme of things for a computer mouse. I received it end of June, and it is currently middle of December. So about 6 months until the roller/scroller part of the mouse broke.",2021,12
This mouse was extremely cheap,2021,12
Only used a few times and the left click broke. Might want to select a different one,2021,12
Hate how slow and moving action is.  Adjustments don't work.  Worse mouse ever had. Looks neat but that's all.,2021,12
This is the worst mouse every! I charged it over night with the usb still in my computer and then when i got up to use it in the morning it wasn't turning on.,2021,12
Amazing product able to take it where ever and connect when needed nice and small fits any where  a need for on the go!,2021,12
"I was looking for a simple, inexpensive wireless mouse to use on a server that I only have to access occasionally. This fit the bill perfectly. Drivers installed automatically from Windows 10 and I'm off to the races. Great price for a simple solution.",2021,12
"So far, it works great",2021,12
"This wireless rechargeable mouse is exactly what I wanted, its light and just the right size for my laptop. With so many options on Amazon I'm glad I chose this product, and the sleep mode function and colors are really cool, would recommend this product to anyone looking for a awesome mouse.",2021,12
The mouse worked adequately when it arrived.  After a couple weeks it started going through periods where the sensor was unresponsive one minute and then worked fine the next.  At this point its mostly unusuable.  It has an annoying habit of losing connection and suddenly staring straight up while gaming.  Makes fast paced competitive games nearly impossible.Waste your money on some other brand's piece of junk mouse.,2021,12
Very nice product.,2021,12
Bought it 4 months ago. Worked great in the beginning. Stopped working a few days ago. Had to go back to an old wire mouse I had. Not a happy camper.,2021,12
"It wasn't until my husband gave me his mouse to play my Sims 4 with that I realized how much I loved using one, even on a laptop. He said I could have his red and black one, but lo-and-behold, when I opened up Amazon and put in 'wireless mouse', I found my own type of dream mouse. I got the mint green colored one and honestly I'm obsessed with the glowing of the different colors. Great mouse, great price. I wish I needed more than one to be honest.",2021,12
"Charged the mouse over 1h, use it for 5min it completely drain out….. and it too late to return since I bought it months ago. What a wast.",2021,12
So I got this in the mail and immediately started using it. It worked great in the beginning. Super quiet and the color change is cool but after a week or two I was using it and it just stopped working. It would turn on but wouldn't work on my laptop and it was the only computer I have used it on. I can barely get it to move on the screen and then it just shuts off. But it really was great when I first got it.,2021,12
"USB-C adaptor is not working, but that's why I bought this mouse.",2021,12
Mousewheel doesn't work... yikes,2021,11
"This is the worst wireless mouse I've ever had the displeasure of using. I bought it thinking how bad can it really be, it just needs to connect to my laptop. Well, if this could be a negative star rating I would do it. If you stop moving the mouse for 10 seconds or more, you have to turn it off and then turn it back on again because it loses its tracking and doesn't respond to your movements. It doesn't have any accuracy while clicking things and its uncomfortable to use. IT IS GARBAGE.",2021,12
Complete trash. Would not charge.,2021,12
"Works great! No problems so far, lights up nicely.",2021,12
"I needed this for work, rechargeable, nice looking, easy to use  but broke after 3 weeks",2021,12
Exactly what the title says,2021,12
"I needed a slim, responsive mouse and I got exactly what I needed! I bought for work, and connected with no issues. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a reliable mouse. A+ customer service too.",2021,12
Type C adaptor does not go in the computer port properly so it doesn’t work.,2021,12
This didn't last 3 months before it stopped taking a charge. Will not be buying another one.,2021,12
Works well with something underneath otherwise it seems to “wander”. Besides that it feels great.,2021,12
It broke after only a week... the little thing in the middle to scroll stopped scrolling.. I got one just like it from Walmart for cheaper and it actually bluetooths to the computer.,2021,12
Very comfortable and the sleep mode works well It looks good too,2021,12
"just spend the extra money on a mouse that will actually last you more than TWO USES, I'm highly annoyed",2021,12
"This mouse is super clean-looking and connects fast. It not only recharges within 2 hours, but it lasts a long time. I've been using it pretty frequently for the past week and only charged it once. It's still going strong. I love how it lights up and it can be used on a mac or windows computer. Very light and easy to transport as well.",2021,12
"I initially loved this mouse. I liked the fact I could recharge it instead of batteries. However after the first week, it just stopped working. I have recharged it and still nothing.",2021,12
Mi laptop,2021,12
This thing literally started skipping after 5 minutes of use,2021,12
Love this product. Working from home and love the color! Works great,2021,12
I like this mouse because of the LEDs and the color. But the USB converter that it comes with is not reliable. I had to use a different one in order for the mouse to be usable. I have also noticed sometimes a lag in clicks so I wouldn’t suggest this for gaming or something where you need to be super responsive and precise,2021,12
"I bought this mouse in April 2021.  I liked it a lot for 8 1/2 months.  For the last few weeks, it has stopped tracking reliably and the battery dies within about a half hour.  Even if I try to use it plugged into the computer, it stops tracking and the lights dim.  I can't find any warranty information on it.  I feel like it should have lasted more than 9 months.  I think I'll buy a wireless mouse with a known brand name and hope for better luck.",2021,12
"Its just literally not working at all. I charged it for three hours and connected the USB to the adapter and plugged it in to my MacBook and it just does not work. I have turned it on and off, put the USB back in the mouse and tried again and again and it just will not work. Instructions were absolutely useless since it just said to turn the mouse on and off.",2021,12
"First purchase, I received the wrong color. They switched it out no problem. Second mouse came, and it stopped working within two -three weeks. Because of the shipping coming from overseas the whole process just made the product less appealing. Disappointed it stopped working so soon.",2021,12
I get so many compliments in the office about my mouse. It’s a huge hit in the office and now 4 coworkers own it in different colors,2021,12
I purchased this mouse for using with MacBook pro 2021. There is no lag while using it and is compatible with MacBook.,2021,12
"Okay, I understood that having a mouse with cool shifting lights was probably going to result in somewhat reduced battery life; I just didn’t expect THIS. The mouse seems to have no sleep mode (the lights stay on unless it’s completely switched off), and the battery lasts less than two days, brand new. I thought to myself that I could make that work by just remembering to plug it in at night, because I do like how the mouse feels and works ... except last night I plugged it in, and this morning, 10 hours later, it WASN’T DONE CHARGING. I have resorted to just keeping it plugged in all day while using it, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a wireless mouse in the first place, and ties up two USB ports instead of just one. Shame. Back to the drawing board on my mouse search.",2021,12
"overall I really like the mouse, but the scroll button doesn't work. Also, I was not able to find a way to contact the seller to resolve the issue.",2021,12
good product,2021,12
This mouse is sleek and looks great. But more importantly it works awesome. It moves smoothly and clicks like a whisper. I also love not having to change batteries every other day!! Buy this mouse! I am definitely going to buy an extra or 2!!!,2021,12
This mouse was bad quality.,2021,12
I used this mouse for a laptop. It slowly stopped holding a charge. Disappointed and happened after return item window closed.,2021,12
Super cool,2021,12
"Won't connect to my Dell laptop running Windows 10. And I'm not a computer illiterate moron either. This mouse just flashes a red light twice and doesn't connect. The system shows it's connected, but doesn't recognize. I'm returning to spend an extra ten bucks for a name brand Mouse that will work.",2021,12
"I’ve had for lass than a month and it already doesn’t work anymore. I left it on for a couple hours while i was away (fully charged and working perfectly when i left) and when i came home, it refused to work. i have charged it, i have taken out the usb and reinserted it and i have turned it off and on a million times and it just doesn’t work anymore. i am so incredibly disappointed and upset that this broke after less than a month and cannot return it as i don’t have the original packaging anymore. i would give negative stars if i could. i wish i could get my money back to buy a different mouse but unfortunately i can’t anymore. don’t waste your money on this.",2021,12
I'm using it at work and all day. The Battery lasted 6 days before a recharge. I ordered another one for home. This is a good product with a good price,2021,12
Love it!,2021,12
I loved this mouse! Until is stopped working after 3 months.,2021,12
 Nice for the price. Would buy again.,2021,12
"I bought this mouse because I needed a wireless mouse for work. It came in a cheap box written In mostly Chinese. It is a nice color and it was easy to setup. I used this for work for 2 weeks, and today, I went to use it and it stopped working. It didn’t register on the computer. I am sending this back for a refund and I’ll just get a logic tech.",2021,12
Slim and ergonomic mouse.  Cool LED lights while using it.,2021,12
"I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it, I definitely would be buying one for myself soon!!",2021,12
"Very Quiet! Also, very easy to set up!",2021,12
Great mouse!  Love the lights when using it.,2021,12
I love the quiet click! No more obnoxious loud clicking.,2021,12
"I bought this mouse for a friend & he/she loves it... it is better than the mouse that comes built into he/her laptop... plus it was brought as a replacement for it...As for my friend, she tells me that she loves that it saves her a lot of money on batteries, & she also loves the cool extra lights it has & features on it...",2021,12
"The design of this mouse is nice - I have small hands and this mouse is somewhat small and flat. However, it doesn't have a very smooth movement.  I used it for about an hour and disconnected it from my laptop.",2021,12
"The mouse Clic is silent, it feels very ergonomic at hand, the battery lasts pretty good, my daughter loves itThe lights are so nice specially at night with the room lights offGive it a try",2021,12
So easy to set up and works great! I have had no issues so far. It is perfect also because it comes with a mac compatible connection port. It has made my work sooo much easier- It is smooth and easy to use. I love my new mouse!,2021,12
"After two weeks, the cover just plain separated and couldn't be snapped back on.",2021,12
"First use it connected right away. Has not worked since, don't waste your money.",2021,12
It works well.,2021,12
This is a great cordless mouse. It is rechargeable as long as the computer is on.  There is a place on the bottom to store the dongle if not in the computer.  If dropped it will come apart.  Unfortunately it does fly in a special education classroom.  A stronger shell would be great. Also an extra dongle in case you lose the first one.,2021,12
Unresponisve and choppy movement. Clicks fail to register. Horrible experience with gaming. Rgb looks bad. All around avoid.,2021,12
I bought two of these and both stopped working. This worked great until it just didnt. You cant even charge it anymore it will glow like it is charging and then nothing. Both of them died and stopped charging within a week of each other.,2021,12
"Nothing really to say, it didn’t work with my macbook",2021,12
"It advertise change of color of the light. Mine is only Red.The buttons I have to hit it very had (to the point that I started to click on the board, because my finger hurt.Very pretty, very sleek, so far works very good.",2021,12
Use for two weeks then it stop working. I tried charging it and everything.,2021,12
"If you are like me and have trouble using USB to USB-C converters (somehow I always end up with flaky ones that don't maintain a connection) be warned that this mouse uses the same method to support USB-C. It comes with a USB and USB-C adapter, however you have to plug the USB-C into the USB adapter to use it. You cannot use the USB-C adapter on its own. Which means I have a 2"" long, double adapter sticking out of my computer, just waiting to get knocked off. Had I known up front that the USB-C adapter required the USB adapter to work, I would not have made this purchase.",2021,12
"I bought this mouse not even a month ago, it quit working. I have had it plugged in for about 15 hours to charge it. Does not work. In order to use it I have to keep it plugged into the computer. Waist of money.",2021,12
"Sleek, good battery backup, auto sleep, LED lights, silent clicks",2021,12
"I bought this because I hate using the mouse pad on my laptop and it’s great to throw in my laptop bag and pull out when I need it. It charges by plugging it into the laptop but I haven’t had to do that yet besides giving it a full charge when I opened it up the first time. It does go into sleep mode to save the battery which took a minute to figure out but once you realize that it’s not broken, just asleep, it’s all good! Overall it’s just a basic wireless mouse that works well and is sleek and portable.",2021,12
I really like this mouse for work. I use mine all day I charge it on Wednesday mid week and leave it charging Friday over the weekend. Works completely fine. I'm coming back and buying two more. I had to come buy more because I dropped mine and it cracked open that's the only reason why. Not because it stopped working but because I broke mine so this time in also getting a backup! My work laptop is a Mac and I'd rather much buy this mouse than the expensive Apple one.,2021,12
"The idea of this mouse sounded nice and fun. However, I was very disappointed to see that the usb is slightly bigger than other usb cables and it did not fit into my laptop, or any other usb port for that matter. Perhaps this one was defective, but this was unacceptable. I would give zero stars if I could.",2021,12
This mouse works great with my new laptop for business use. Very pretty and sleek. Love the led lights.,2021,12
"i followed all instructions, nothing happened, and the mouse does not work at all, nothing pops up linking the mouse to my computer",2021,12
"And it's only wireless half the time. The other half you'll have it plugged in and charging because a charge doesn't last very long. That's why they give you that little short charging wire that plugs in the front of the mouse. That makes it hard to use when charging. Everyone knows it's easier to drag a chain up a hill than to push it up. Well, everyone but these people.Update - the battery has completely gone dead. It won't even take a charge anymore after only three months. You have to keep it plugged into your laptop at all times, and even then it goes dead occasionally if you use it too much or too fast. You have to wait 10 to 20 seconds for it to ""charge"" just so you can use it for another 5 seconds. It's even worse than the 2 star rating I gave it originally.",2021,12
Definitely serves a purpose and matches my decor.,2021,12
The wheel breaks easily,2021,12
End up returning it within 2 weeks of purchase.  This is light (not in a good way) weight.  Feels like its cheaply made. My clicks and moves were not in sync when I clicked the mouse to my new Surface Laptop.,2021,11
for browsing,2021,11
 Great design overall. Let’s see how long this mouse lasts me. Love that the noise clicking is very quiet. I also love the glossed turquoise color. No problem connecting to the Bluetooth on my computer.,2021,11
It twitches only the screen and I constantly click the wrong thing even when it’s not physically moving,2021,11
Tried to take this to and from work and the wheel in the center is no longer functional,2021,11
"I am a fan on jelly bean type of mouse. I had a previous jelly bean mouse that I ended up giving to a family member and was searching for another one to replace it and I came across this one. The lights is the one that did the trick for me here, just love the lights, other than that its a nice, light mouse, could have been a little shorter, its a longer mouse compared to my previous one, but other than that very functional and light and can be carried in the pockets to meetings in offices which is what I do primarily with this one.",2021,11
I really love this mouse for my laptop. I don’t have to worry about changing out batteries. It doesn’t take long to charge but charge last awhile with normal use. Bought one for myself and a second for my daughter.,2021,11
I bought this product 2 months ago. The wireless had good range. You can use it while charging. Color led looks good during night time. Simple and handy. Fast charging. ON OFF buttons. Worth for money.,2021,11
It took one week of using this mouse before deciding to just get a better quality mouse.,2021,11
"Wow, this mouse is pretty. I choose the gold colored one and i like it. Connecting to my laptop was simple, just plug and play. Plus the slim design fits great in my laptop bag.",2021,11
Actually the mouse is pretty nice design and the button are also quite smoothWould definitely recommend,2021,11
"This mouse is sleek and cool looking.  It's fun to use and everyone is envious of it because it lights up.  Best mouse I have ever got.  I want another for my desktop, I use this one on my laptop.  Best buy for the money and so cool too!!!",2021,11
"great product, no issues",2021,11
cannot wait to use. seems to be really nice,2021,11
I like it cause I don’t have to spend money on batteries,2021,11
"Used it twice! Was so happy with it! Worked great! Tried to use it the last 2 days and it doesn’t work at all! Turn it on, light comes on, then turns off and won’t turn back on. Not pleased!",2021,11
 It’s a good mouse led good im still trying learn how it works but so far so good for now,2021,11
Works well. Worth it,2021,11
USB C adapter doesn't work and light on mouse fuzzes out when plugged into a different computer that allows for usb.,2021,11
"Great product and packaging overall, durable materialsSmooth point and (silent) click featureEasy to follow instructionsBright led lights make this mouse FUN for any age! (bonus:you can opt to turn the led function off if/when needed)Tired of all that clicking?  This mouse is for you with the silent clickDefinitely a product worth owning!",2021,11
For my laptop and received it the next day.,2021,11
Exactly as described.  Works great fir my chromebook.,2021,11
The product is good and operates well.,2022,08
"In short: you get what you pay forI am currently traveling and needed a cheap mouse I could use. This one definitely does the trick and looks nice with the colors on the side but also has a couple downsides: the DPI change button doesn't work on Mac, the colors at the border aren't really bright and even + the red light of the sensor always shines through, it also is a bit small if you have big hands (which is a upset if you're traveling, since it will fit in small spaces)In general: it is a good mouse if you do not want to spend a lot of money but there are things that could be better if you want to spend a bit more.",2021,11
Of course I didn't expect high quality product for this low price. But man the mouse didn't even last a week. It's dead. I charged it just one time and dead. It could have worked at least half a year. I just can't believe that Amazon let sellers like this run business on their platform.,2021,11
"I was looking for this mouse for my new Samsung Galaxy tab S7, have a really good and soft clic, you don't have to worry about the battery. If you need a wireless mouse this one is for you. I highly recommend this one.",2021,11
"Did not work well for me, only worked when it felt like it. Very inconsistent.",2021,11
"I chose this ergonomic mouse because I liked the shape and it seemed to be easy to hold and use. When I received it, I was thrilled because it is so colorful! I also like that it will work with my little mouse pad I use for my Chrome Book~! I have used it since it arrived and I am happy with it so far! With this mouse, I can play my games easier and it is also quiet and easy to use! I recommend this mouse to all! I am a happy customer!",2021,11
It is hard to use and the sensation is not good.,2021,11
"PC mice i've purchased in the past lasted years, not months. i caution purchase of this mouse for tha reason.",2021,11
"Once I received this product, I am very satisifed with how it looks and how light it felt. It is also very convenient considering it is rechargeable with no batteries needed. I HIGHLY recommend this product 👌",2021,11
I love this mouse and I can’t wait to get another one just like it. I use this one at work and it’s very comfortable and not loud clicking either .,2021,11
Love this mouse it’s small and slim. Works great and you can turn the lights on or off to meet your preference.,2021,11
Works as expected.,2021,11
"A bunch of the lights are out so that’s kinda annoying. I could tell the box had been opened and it was probably a return. It’s not super ergonomic, at least for people who would wear med/large size medical gloves.It does what it’s supposed to do but I’m gonna get a different one for my work computer and use this one for my personal computer that I use maybe once a month. It doesn’t feel very good in my hand to use all day at my desk.",2021,11
"Mainly a mouse youd keep at home on a desk, not really suited for travel, battery life is great, I charged it once a month ago and for being in highschool, all of our work is on the chromebook, and this mouse hasnt died yet",2021,11
Mouse feels like it's of good quality and so far haven't had any issues with it working with my XPS,2021,11
super unresponsive. fun idea but would not recommend to anyone.,2021,11
"I really like this wireless mouse.  I love the changing colors, and the rose gold is gorgeous.  My only ""complaint"" is the the USB (to connect to your laptop) is very hard to get out. I always need some sort of tool to get it out. Ergonomically, since this review had me rate it, it's perhaps a little too slim. But, I don't game, and I'm a light laptop user, so I doesn't bother me that much. Otherwise, I would buy again and put up with the pesky USB when I travel.",2021,11
I love this mouse! So glad I went wireless makes my desk so much more organized💕,2021,11
I am very happy with this mouse and love the color!,2021,11
I've had the mouse less than 6 months and both the roller wheel and the piece that plugs into the USB port both broke. I managed to super glue the roller wheel back together but it just broke again. Buy a slightly better mouse if you can. Not sure if all the reviews are even real.,2021,11
I like the look and feel but the mechanic's of using it are slime after a week,2021,11
"Battery life is horrible on this mouse, won't last more than 5 minutes, thought it was a fluke and got a replacement because the mouse is comfortable and cool looking but the second one they sent me was even worse with a whopping 1 minute battery life after full charge.",2021,11
"Pretty cool mouse. Honestly, was only looking for a simple mouse to use with my laptop. The tracking works great and the colors are pretty cool...nothing like adding a little color to your workstation. Being able to recharge the mouse is a plus.",2021,11
Lights are visible through white part because white part is thin but it’s nice,2021,11
Not suitable for long term.  It broke after 2 months.,2021,11
"It has too much lag, it's slow & that's why I hate it",2021,11
" I don’t use the color changing feature, so with that, the battery life lasts a really long time! I say that because I purchased this May 20, 2021 and my battery just now needs charged December 1, 2021 and I use this 5 days a week for work 10 hours a day. I love this product!!! No noise, sleek, comfortable, just love it! Worth it, hands down!",2021,11
"I bought this as just a quick way to navigate my tablet in a hurry. The sleep mode is perfect since I don't use it but now and then when I hear an alert, just tap to wake up and click. No need to keep re-syncing and the charge has lasted a LONG time. Tiny but not too tiny!",2021,11
"I really love how easy it is to setup this mouse, nothing to download just plug and play! I have been looking for a slim mouse that works on my Mac and windows machine that doesn’t need batteries or a mousepad and this definitely fits the bill. The lights are a cute, fun addition but are subtle enough to not be a distraction while using and don’t seem to drain the battery too much. Overall I think it’s great for anyone looking for something easy to use.",2021,11
This mouse was great for about two months. Then it stopped charging and won’t work. Don’t waste your money!,2021,11
"Hello, received the new mouse today, thank you and your service is very good , again thank you. But the only concern that I have is that the box is open and my power cord is dirty and not wrapped up the way it should have been.  But that is okay, I am going to plug this one in. And it work then we are good to go. Again thank you so such for a fast re-supply.I Give you( 5 stars ).Mr. Ronald Wooten",2021,11
"I was tired of the wire noises and the knots they created. It was always a mess, plus it stopped working hence I was looking for a mouse. This mouse is amazing. It is light, easy to connect, the LED works good, doesn’t make sound, and the customer service is good.If you are looking for a mouse with a low budget, this is definitely the one you are looking for,",2021,11
I bought this mouse for my wife but I loved it so much that I had to get a second 1 for myself. It has a really great feel and it works really well,2021,11
The mouse is slim and lightweight. I love the way that the inbuilt LED light in the mouse changes its colors. It is very easy to install the mouse on the laptop.  The day I bought the mouse I have been using it without charging the battery for 15 days. After surfing the mouse on amazon I thought I found the right mouse for my computer.,2021,11
"I always wanted a mouse which is similar to the apple one and found this to use for my windows laptop. its very stylish.RGB light looks pretty cool. Like the sleep Feature, it goes to sleep pretty quickly saving the battery and also that the mouse is rechargeable.",2021,11
"Don't order it, it does not function well at all.",2021,11
This mouse was so cute and easy to use. I love the colors. But after two months it won’t connect to my computer. It sometimes lights up but not consistently and my computer doesn’t recognize it.,2021,11
Do not recommend this product. It was super cheap feeling and did not work well at all.,2021,11
"Mouse only “right clicks” making it useless. I have read others are having this problem too. Went into computer settings, everything is set up right. Mouse does not work",2021,11
I suppose I shouldn't have expected much for the money.,2021,11
It doesn't work,2021,11
"This mouse is very slow in reaction, not sensitive to the movement and make my hand tiring already after 10 minutes usage, too bad I only start using it after the return window closed.",2021,11
I find that not having to rely on battery is a relief. The color change is very nice,2021,11
I had high hopes due to all the positive reviews but this mouse became virtually useless after just 3 weeks. I would move the mouse on the mouse pad back and forth and it would barely move on the screen. Every task on the computer began to take 4x's the amount of time it used to. I had to resort to using the trackpad on my Macbook which I'm not a fan of. Definitely don't get this mouse. Not worth it.,2021,11
"Wow you really can’t go wrong with this mouse. Bought it for work since they still have the wired mouse but the traction is horrible. With this replacement, no wires no cables only to charge it. The traction is great very responsive.",2021,11
I got this because I have a laptop and sometimes that little square isn’t enough. It’s easy to set up easy to use I have no problems as of yet,2021,11
Not worth the value,2021,11
The adapter for the laptop doesn’t work… I have one from dell which worked fine.,2021,11
"I absolutely love this mouse, it’s super easy to use and really fun with the different colors. 10 out of 10!",2021,11
"I was very disappointed in this mouse. I had a hard time clicking it and thought maybe I just had to get used to it. By day 3, I wanted to throw it away. I bought a new one and kept it for students to use if they need it. (They hate it too)",2021,11
I like that this mouse is rechargeable. Feels weird in my hand and doesn’t move as fast as I expect,2021,11
Great product. As advertised. Works really well very nice.,2021,11
"I bought this mouse back in Sept 2021, to match my laptop color that I use for my Work From Home job.  The 2nd week of  Nov 2021 it stopped working.  It will no longer charge up.  Needless to say I am not happy.",2021,11
The mouse doesn't work. The reason they have good ratings is because they ask you to rate 5 Star and promise refund. Don't buy.,2021,11
"Super cute. Works great. LOVE the rainbow lights. However, it takes a while to charge, and the charge does not last long at all. I don’t even bother to use it anymore because it’s not even worth the hassle.",2021,11
mouse wheel doesn't work,2021,11
Adorable Mouse. It works very well and I love that you are able to recharge it. The mouse speed is very good and overall very enjoyable to use while working from home.,2021,11
Sleek and easy to use and fast charging,2021,11
This stopped working after a month. Even after charging it won’t turn on.,2021,10
"It was a great mouse, until it stopped working and charging. I literally only used it about 5-6 times since buying it and when I put it on the charger this last time, it just completely stopped working. The charger light wouldn't come on and it wouldn't charge. I even switched USBs to see if it maybe had a short in the wire, and still nothing.Now that I'm reading other reviews, I see the problem. Wish I would have read them thoroughly before buying it.Buy this only if you want something short-lasting, with pretty colors. Other than that, I don't recommend this at all.",2021,11
I got the pink one and it is so nice! I love that it's rechargeable. It is very well made and works perfectly. Comes with a USB-C adaptor as well. It's a great size and there's no lag. Overall I'm very happy.,2021,11
"It got delivered a month ago and it has stopped working after using for like the 4th time. It turns on them off immediately, it’s got a charge and just won’t work. Glad I got my invoice since I can still write it off as a business expense. Not a good product and will not buy again. Not very pleased with this device.",2021,11
Quit working already,2021,11
Fits comfortably and it is very pretty.,2021,11
"Love the lights that shine thru, very light and easy to pack for travel. Instant setup. Very pleased with this wireless mouse.",2021,11
Love this mouse. It's the coolest one I've ever had. You can't go wrong with this item,2021,11
Just received my mouse.  Connected to computer immediately with no hassle.  Works smooth - no jerky motion.  Guides to your movement without any hesitation.  Quite buttons with feeling of padding underneath.  Love it.  Lights are beautiful.,2021,11
"You get what you pay for.  Noted.I have to click this mouse at least three times to get it to do what i want, on any button on it. It is so frustrating and i find myself wishing i would have spent more for a quality product, which i may now have to do anyway bc im just so unhappy with it.  It is so cheaply made (plastic all around) i wonder how this can justify a price of over $5.  JMO. Others seem to like it. It just was not what i am looking for. I used it as replacement to my iMac mouse (circa 2012) which finally died. I miss the magic mouse but not $79 worth. Lol im going to have to find a happy medium. This mouse doesn't get it. At all.Only redeeming factor is it is rechargeable.",2021,11
Horrible,2021,11
"I just brought this mouse for  my laptop game, cheaper and function enough for me. Good buy!!!",2021,11
"I like that this mouse has a sleek look to it. Slim & ergonomic. Good quality, not cheap looking. I like the color options available. Very easy set up.  I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and it works great! I have not used it for gaming.  Great price and i will likely buy my next mouse, for a different computer I have, from the same place.",2021,11
This product is awful,2021,11
"UPDATE 12/6/21:Seller has contacted me asking me to remove my review and attempting to bribe me with money to do so. I expected this as several other comments say they too received the same bribery. They even went as far as sending me a “here’s how to remove” link.Purchased this as an upcoming Christmas gift for my sister as it was similar to one she wanted that is not available right now. The box for the mouse is mostly in another language and paired with the price that prompted me to test it before wrapping it up and giving it to her come the holiday. Let me just say, I am glad that I did.While the mouse powered on and worked fine with the USB dongle that it requires be plugged in to use, I decided to test it's other feature of being able to charge it while using it. Everything worked fine UNTIL I UNPLUGGED IT. Once I unplugged the micro-usb cable from the mouse my entire PC turned OFF. I thought maybe it was just a fluke so I tested it again. Nothing happened the second time so I plugged it back in for a little bit to make sure it had a full charge on it for her, and when I unplugged it to re-package it, it happened again. As to say I am now running virus detecting software to err on the side of caution and this product is getting returned as defective.Moral of the store, don't buy cheap products.",2021,11
"Product was great, just the delivery was horrible this is the first time I've ever had issues, they crammed it so tight in my mailbox I like to have never gotten it out and could've damaged my product just by trying to get it outta the mailbox.",2021,11
I really liked the mouse but it broke after a few months. It does not follow my commands (eg copy and paste).,2021,11
"Absolutely nothing is working on this. Acts like it’s charged, but it’s not? Won’t Bluetooth to my computer…nothing is working. Don’t waste your money.",2021,11
So frustrating! It just responds less and less. Even immediately after charging for a full day! So disappointing.,2021,11
I bought this for a backup wireless mouse.  It only lasts about 4 hours per charge. Not good when you work remotely for 8 hours a day.,2021,11
"The colors are fun and different. The thing I did not like was that the default color is red, if it is not in rainbow mode. The material is okay. It works at it should. It is great that its rechargeable. It holds a charge for a long time, and if you forget to turn it off, the sleep mode works well.",2021,11
Comfortable and easy to use. The sleep feature is convenient because you do not need to charge as often.,2021,11
"It charged within an hour or two out of the box. I like the lightweight, slim feel of the mouse. The storage of the USB clip is secure and pretty easy to get in/out. While it's not ""important"", I like the changing colors of the lights inside the mouse. Just a fun feature. So far it works great for the inexpensive price!",2021,11
"The mouse itself is easy to use. However, the usb-usbc adapter does not work. I couldn't get the mouse to work with my macbook until I bought a different adapter.",2021,11
Do not buy this mouse. It stopped working in 2 weeks.,2021,07
"I've tried so many wireless mice over the years and one of the most annoying has always been how quickly the battery dies and they are not included. When I ordered this mouse, I got it because it lit up and matches my laptop. When I got it, I was pleased to learn it was rechargeable! Mind blown and brilliant! The mouse, will go into a sleep mode when you aren't using it, or you can turn it off and on easily.Perhaps the only con is that it doesn't come with instructions.Absolutely, love this mouse and I highly recommend it!!",2021,11
"The mouse is big enough to use and very smooth with my computer. I always look for a wireless mouse, so this one is the best on amazon that I could find—highly recommended!",2021,11
"Terrible quality, after 4 weeks no good, will not recommend buying at all, its a waste",2021,11
reasonable price however item stopped working.,2021,11
It is nice looking and quiet,2021,11
This mouse quit working after 2 weeks. Poor quality. Returned!,2021,11
"I've had 2 of these randomly stop working in the last year. Both stopped clicking after minimal use(less than 7 days on the first one, less than 30 for the second). I don't understand why this product is so highly rated, it's terrible! Learn from my mistakes!",2021,11
Looks just like the picture.  I don't know about sleep mode or gaming as I use it for my office.  The only thing I wish was different was that the charge be updated to the newer c charger like my Samsung phone and laptop.,2021,11
Works great,2021,11
"Good wireless mouse, portable, ergonomic and the size is just right. Love how it has lights and changing colors.",2021,11
I bought it for gaming and everyday use. It stopped working really fast. It lags behind which was driving me crazy. Then it just died after a month. Don’t waste your money,2021,11
Works well when charged. Nearly impossible to charge though. The port connection must be off.,2021,11
Stop working after a few days. Do not buy this mouse.,2021,11
the good part about it is very convenient and it saves a lot in batteries and you can still use it when charging to the laptop. also the lights lets you know when is time to charge it. like it a lot,2021,11
"Loved it as long as it worked. Stopped working yesterday. I even tried charging it again but it wouldn't even do that. With only a month to return if not working, I am out a mouse and must buy another one. Too bad as I really did like this model. Now onto shopping.....",2021,11
Love it!! This mouse is very sleek and thin. 100 A+,2021,11
Didn't work.,2021,11
This does not fit on my laptop.  The part that fits into the laptop to make the mouse work did not fit.,2021,11
"First off I love the color, it’s what made me purchase it in the first place. I didn’t need a mouse, but I like having a spare.Now for my review, as far as what I’m used to for comfort, this mouse sits FLAT. So be aware of that if you plan on using it for long periods of time. Fits nicely in your hand, I have medium small hands, so please take that into consideration with the review.The lights, I loved the different light modes, it actually made it feel like I had a $150 gaming mouse, while not being so hard on my wallet.Now for push button response… my right click wasn’t working properly, barely clicked down and would sometimes Mia click from it being mispositioned. I had to lift it up to see the issue was the prong was bad. I broke it off and now it is clicking as intended. So please be aware, this is all VERY fragile plastic within its housing.Overall the mouse is great if you need a spare, and I would buy again if I needed another. I hate out of 5 stars, because 4/5 feels worse than 8/10…but I feel an 8/10 is more accurate to how I feel, as it has a lot of great features, such as charging vs batteries (and an included usb-c adapter). Overall a wonderful product that I do recommend",2021,11
I thought this mouse was really cool. But then it broke. The scrolly wheel thing doesnt move anymore. It lasted like a week. And its not my main computer so it didnt get used much in that week.,2021,11
Love it,2021,11
Bought this for my son to use for school. The roller bar broke the second time he used it. In addition  to this it wouldn’t stay charged. 100% dissatisfied customer!,2021,11
It's really a waste of money. Bought it in August and started falling apart end of Sept and completely broke in Nov. Not worth the money.,2021,11
"I needed a wireless mouse for my new MacBook Pro that only has USB-C connections.  This mouse included an adapter that allowed the standard USB Bluetooth receiver to be used in the USB-C port.  I have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far, but it seems very responsive and performed well.  The led lights are kinda cool, but not really needed.  I'm trying to see if there is a way to use the mouse without the led lights on so I can conserve the charge on the battery.  The only concern/issue I've had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapter don't seem to be the most secure, and a couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging.  I was still using my laptop while the mouse was charging via the USB-C port as recommended in the user manual.  The user manual specifically recommends NOT using a plug-in charging adapter like for most cell phones because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it.  It is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your laptop to avoid overcharging and damaging the mouse.  I'm not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if I continue to use my laptop while trying to charge the mouse.  We'll see how it goes in the future.  If it turns out that it was operator error, I may update my rating.Overall, though, the mouse feels good in my hand, and it seems to work well, doing everything necessary when I need it.",2021,11
I cannot get this mouse to work even when I plug in with cord,2021,11
"Like this new mouse :)It works well and installation was also very easy.So far, I really satisfy its performance and quality.",2021,11
Was great! Had smooth control & felt great in your hand. I had a small issue getting it to charge but I figured it out. I love the style & function of this mouse,2021,11
I have it for my personal computer and it has worked out great,2021,11
"I bought this mouse to use with my MacBook since it comes with a type-c connector. Overall I really like it, the color matches my MacBook and it’s slim so it fits in my little bag where I keep my chargers in. I recommend this for office work but not for gaming, your wrist gets tired since it’s really slim",2021,11
"Straight out of the box it is sleek and feels good in my hand. However, it does not read on or off the mousepad. Very disappointed.",2021,11
"Just by the Logitech and skip the ""savings"" from this cheap import.  I bought this to replace a wired mouse on my kvm switch and it worked great... for two months.  Would plug in to charge (using an open USB port on my switch was super convenient), turning it off every night while it charged.  The next day, unplug and flip it to the middle setting so lights were not on constantly, and I was able to use for the whole day 8-10hrs no problem.  Then, about two weeks ago, same usual routine, go to use the next day and completely dead.  Revert back to wired mouse and let it charge until lunch (4hrs later), swap back out... lights come on for about 10 seconds and again: completely dead.Now I'm out of the return policy not even 6 months later and screwed.",2021,11
"I ordered this mouse because I was tired of using my laptops track pad at school. It arrived on time, charges quickly, has a very satisfying and quiet mouse click sound and overall is a great mouse for the price. The only issue I face is that the RGB on the front of the mouse is almost completely broken and there are small sections around the edges that are broken as well. It doesn't prevent the mouse from doing its job though and I often find myself using the mouse with the RGB off anyway. Overall, good mouse just don't expect the RGB to work amazingly, it is only $14 after all.",2021,11
"This product is excellent, I love its lights, it charges super easy, it is soft to the touch and accurate on movement.",2021,11
"Good mouse I can use for working at home, ordered the rose gold which is pretty cute for desk decor and the lights are fun. It functions well and it’s quiet when you click which is great",2021,11
The mouse worked fine for maybe 3 or 4 hours with my PC laptop. Tried it on another laptop and desktop with same result. The cursor moves intermittently and is not useable. Fully charged the mouse and tried with and without USB-C adaptor and no change.,2021,11
Stopped charging and working after a month. Thought it maybe have just been dead. Charged it a lot more and still didn’t work. Looked at reviews and saw that many others had this issue as well,2021,11
"Cannot go wrong for the price. Buttons are totally silent and feel solid, same with the scroll wheel. Not a gaming most but I've had no problems with accuracy. Comes with a slim USB port and a pretty large USB C port but it allows for USB passthrough which is neat. Can't speak to battery life yet but it seems to have great power saving features so. Easily recharge with micro usb. Note: this does not have Bluetooth.",2021,11
"cordless mouse is okay out of the box, after a few months of use it's starting to wear out. I now have to start double clicking to make sure it responds to the icons I click on. colors are still great. It's great not having to change batteries, it's pretty much quite as far as clicking, but as noted above it will still wear out sooner than expected.",2021,11
I love this mouse. Cool color scheme and comfy to use,2021,11
it does not work at all ! I cvharges itight goes on then all of a sudden turns.off and its like touching a toy plastic.like mouse its not worth the money,2021,11
No quality,2021,11
"I bought this mouse for my son to do homework at home. He was excited to to used it. This LED wireless mouse have so many color to choice. The mouse is light weight, rechargeable, pad smooth button are easily to click and responsive. I love it because is good price and you can bring for work and traveling super easy. I am definitely recommend this mouse.",2021,11
"This mouse is amazing! Very comfortable, smooth and aesthetically pleasing. Charge lasts forever.",2021,11
It connected immediately with my computer and makes no noise and i like the ergonomics on the mouseI can move my mouse faster than my other mouse,2021,11
"Used it for about a week and when it stopped working, we could not get it to recharge properly.",2021,11
"Stopped tracking well after a week of use. Waste of money, spend a little more and get a better quality mouse to begin with with.",2021,11
It's a very nice wireless mouse，very quite，the color is very nice too，I like it so much,2021,11
We got this mouse for my teenage daughter and at first it worked great! She’s only had it for 6 weeks and it stopped working.,2021,11
Pure junk,2021,11
"Great product, Fast shipping",2021,11
"The product is as pictured and even works as described however, it stopped working after less than a week.  I have tried to charge it using different ports and wall outlets, checked the USB/Bluetooth connection, and even disconnected and reconnected however it is still failing to work. I am in the process of returning and will be looking for a new replacement elsewhere.",2021,11
"It had connectivity issues right out of the box. I contacted the seller and he/she did not respond. It never worked. Even if it had, it is so misshapen it isn't comfortable to use. Cannot recommend seller or product.",2021,11
" OH MY GOD. This was EVERYTHING I was looking for. I bought a mouse and keyboard for my phone, because I wanted to type my essays on my phone, when I don't have a computer. And this mouse works on my phone! Yay! And it's my favorite color",2021,11
"So we’ve gone thru quite a few wireless items over the last few years. This one by far has knocked it out of the park. I actually allowed my 9 year old to pick her mouse this year (she’s 9) and she picked based on color. I read the description. The review’s were good and the price was right so we hit “buy now”. I love sleep mode, I really love that it’s rechargeable, battery lasts weeks. I like that it lights up when it’s charging and let’s you know when it’s done. And an added bonus: it’s the cutest shade of baby pink.",2021,11
"This product does what I need it to do, and does it perfectly. I'm super picky about stuff, and I can honestly say I am very well pleased. I do believe I have to turn it off for a moment when it hibernates, but that is whatever to me. Haha",2021,11
"Wireless mouse went out ordered this one. Arrived early. Feels good in hand, easy to control. The lights are ""cute"" as they change colors lol. But the overall feel is good. Not huge and the recharge is most def the highlightThank you",2021,11
"This is a nice mouse for the price. If you don't need extra buttons it's a good choice, especially if you want something that recharges rather than eating batteries.",2021,11
"Stopped working less than 24 hours after I received the package. It would cost me more to return it than what I paid for it, so it’s just sitting in my office, making clutter. Honestly, would not recommend it at all.",2021,11
"Contacted the seller about the battery not holding a charge , told me to plug it in .....  Sent it back.",2021,11
"Not really ergonomic but I don't have an underlying issue where this is a problem for me.  I love the color changing aspect.  Conversation piece and the charge lasts a couple of days.  I also turn it off when I leave so I really don't know how long it really lasts but I have not had any issues.  Its a mouse, if you want it, get it - if you don't, don't.",2021,11
Battery won't last. Unable to return since my return window close.,2021,11
"This is a nice, sleek little mouse. I'm very pleased with the size and the connection/range. I was looking for one that wasn't too clunky but still looked decent. This definitely fits the bill. All the awesome colors is just a plus for my own personal amusement, also if you don't want the lights all the time there is a setting for that too. Good little mouse for the price.",2021,11
No complaints,2021,11
I like the slim design and color.,2021,11
"The first one had a defective charging cord connector (very loose,) and the replacement sent promptly starts fine and gets steadily slower and more and more draggy and must be turned off and on again to start working normally.  Both were returned under warranty and won't be reordered again.  Neat but not good quality.",2021,11
When I leave the mouse alone for a couple of minutes and then start using it. The mouse is really slow l have trying everything to fix it. Need a new mouse now,2021,11
My mouse suddenly died. They were great at reaching out to me and resolving the problem. Highly recommended purchasing from them.,2021,11
" I rely really love this. I bought it few months ago and I wanted to give a review after some time. I am this every single day, all the day and with the lights on. It has 2 functions,... The first one is like On, snf the second is with lights. I love it, I charge it once every few weeks and it is so silent, I can use it doing my studies till midnight, no problem with the clicking. I can charge it with the USB, so I don't have to change a battery. After few months, my mouse is working sooo good and if it is not charged, then I can connect to USB and continue to work with it. Good investment!",2021,11
I thought it would work but after a week and second one I bought it won’t work.,2021,11
"Purchased in July. By November it would no longer charge. E-Mail to seller sent to address in the instructions would not go thru. G-Mail said that ""recipient server did not accept our requests to connect"".Would not buy from this seller ever again.",2021,11
"It’s all fun and cute at the beginning but after a month in a half (past my refund window) and it has stopped working. I tried charging it, NOTHING! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!",2021,11
"First 24 hours of having it I couldn't get it to charge and isnt usable while on the charging cord. Completely useless, do not buy this cheap junk. If there was a zero stars button it would be ticked.",2021,11
I like how the colors lookIt is not a recognized brand but it does the job!,2021,11
I have used this mouse for two weeks now and it is now not working properly. I have charged it multiple times thinking maybe it was lacking because it didn’t charge all the way. That wasn’t the issue. The curser is lagging and I am unable to use the center piece to scroll through pages. I couldn’t figure out how to message the seller to see what their next steps would be.,2021,11
The mouse is a cool design with it lighting up as you move the mouse around.  My only grip with it is the mouse scroll wheel is not functional.  I've only had it for 2 1/2 months and the scroll wheel stop working. I thought that with charging the unit it would fix the problem but to no eval.  Unfortunately I would not purchase this again.,2021,11
Excelente,2021,11
"At first it felt cheap, but pretty much like all other. Perfect for what I needed.",2021,10
"Not battery operated, since it's led the charge lasts less than a month. With the 3"" tiny charging wire, you can't use while charging.Useless junk!",2021,11
"I like this mouse, however after one week of use the scroll wheel broke.",2021,11
My favorite thing about this mouse is how smooth it feels to the touch. The colors are a great addition and add to the experience of using it. It feels sleek as you move it on a mousepad and all other surfaces and textures. The customer service has been splendid. They replaced a mouse for me and helped answer questions when I inquired about getting a replacement usb receiver. They were a pleasure to communicate with. No complaints,2021,11
"This product is garbage I didn’t even get a charging cord! Oh and by the way, the mouse come out the box broken/not working!Returning and running to a better name brand!",2021,11
Batteries don't last long. Mouse is uncomfortable to use. Goes into sleep mode waaay too fast and has to be turned off and back on to reconnect it,2021,10
My laptop mouse was sticking ordered this bad boy does great and the battery life on this thing is unreal. It last a very long time. The lights super cute.,2021,10
Be very careful about leaving mouse plugged in.  Cord caught fire while using it plugged in.,2021,10
"This mouse feels good in the hand, looks cute as all get out but did not last a month.  After charging only once, I have had issues with it being sluggish and not holding a charge.",2021,10
The colors are bright and the mouse is lightweight. Their customer service is also amazing.,2021,10
Awesome,2021,10
"It would sometimes require extra force to register the click so definitely don't recommend it for gaming. The optics worked very well, so it's definitely a good normal use mouse.",2021,10
Product was easy to set up.  However only lasted a month.  Charging port broke after 2’weeks and was not able to get it to charge a few weeks after that.,2021,10
It does not hold it's charge for long..within 2 hours it's done. Also doesn't track well in comparison to my older wireless mouse. Going back to using it more often.,2021,10
This is the best mouse ever.  It is so responsive and rarely needs recharging.,2021,10
Barely worked for a few hours and died,2021,10
"Works, and the battery lasts a week or two with frequent use and charges easily. One less cord to get snarled in my laptop case, too.The lights around the edge seem silly, but do make it easy to keep track of it in the dark.Goes to sleep after a few minutes of nonuse, requires a mouse click to wake it up, a nuisance, but that means you need not bother to turn it off.Overall, very pleased.",2021,10
"Its a good mouse. Slim, quiet and the battery lasts forever on one charge. Its not very durable though so don't drop it. Luckily its snaps back in place if you do.",2021,10
Works great with my mac book pro!,2021,10
"Small, doesn't respond well",2021,10
This is not compatible with HP or google chrome devices.,2021,10
"Have Purchased 2 of them and both are not working after about 2 weeks, Changed batteries and still no luck , You get what you pay for",2021,10
Perfect no comment everything is pretty good,2021,10
"I plugged it in and let it charge over night, I was so excited to use it becuae I though it was so cute. DID NOT WORK FROM DAY 1When I turned the power on it would flash red, then I would try to use it and nothing - Zero - Zip- nothing would work.Waste of time buying it, waste of time trying to get it to work, and now waste of time having to return it. So very disappointed",2021,10
After bought a day later my daughter fell down and its not working now.,2021,10
This mouse is absolutely done and performed as stated by the seller. Smooth movement and quiet clicks. Virtually no sound and I love the light show it emits around the mouse. If you are looking for great quality and functionality look no further because here it is!!!,2021,10
Very slim easily fits in my laptop case. LED lights work great and add a fun touch to the mouse. No connection issues.,2021,10
"I enjoyed using the mouse while it lasted, but after 2 months of light use the scroll wheel collapsed. Mouse is still responsive, but scrolling no longer works which makes it practically useless to me.",2021,10
The plug to use in a MacBook does not work. I really needed this mouse so I had to go out and buy a plug myself spending more money for what this should have come with. It’s working now but only because I spent more money!!,2021,10
The scrolling mechanism stopped working within 20 minutes of use. I didn’t drop it or handle it improperly. It’s just a piece of junk.,2021,10
"The product is cheap and worked well for the first 2 months, but after that it started becoming unresponsive. I would plug it in because I thought it was low in power, but that didn't solve the issue either. I use a lap top and have a lap desk where it has a built in mouse pad area. I've had it for years so I was thinking it was too old and worn down and the mouse wasn't able to read it. So I bought a new 3M mouse pad, but still nothing. Tried updating drivers with various programs, tweaked a bunch of settings and followed the advice from several websites. Nothing. So I disconnected it and brought out my WIRED  mouse and it isn't working either! This product even disabled my track pad, but luckily I found a way to get it working. I blame this crap product, as it literally almost bricked my laptop",2021,10
Had to exchange first one after a month. Replacement was fast and easy,2021,07
"After two months of non-regular use this mouse has already stopped working properly.  Scroll wheel has completely stopped working on it's own and now feels somewhat ""loose"" when touched.  Was good while it worked and liked the color of it but only two months of use is unacceptable when there are other similar priced options from other companies.",2021,10
"Very basic mouse, rechargeable battery that lasts awhile, great for just needing a simple wireless option at a good price.",2021,10
"I, especially, like that there are NO batteries.  It charges quickly.",2021,10
"I love this mouse!  It's smooth, quiet, and holds the charge.  So glad I purchased it!",2021,10
The sleep mode keeps you from having to charge very often. Feels good in my palm. Quiet click is nice. Works well.,2021,10
"I like it! Ergonomic, sleek and sleep mode is great!",2021,10
"I really like this mouse. I love that it doesn't need batteries! You just charge it and it's ready to go. I did have a issue with my MacBook Pro when connecting the adapter for the receiver it comes with to my computer, it changed my scrolling ability on my laptop trackpad, and I wasn't able to scroll without using the mouse. I had to call Apple to figure out how to fix it and that's when I discovered removing the usb-c adapter the mouse comes with from my computer solved the problem. I have a usb-c to USB adapter from the Mac store, so I just used that for the mouse receiver and it worked perfectly, and it doesn't change my scrolling ability with the trackpad at all.",2021,10
After a month it will not hold a charge junk Have to keep it plugged up to use it,2021,10
"Constantly ""times out"" or goes to sleep, and every time I try to move it to use it again, it takes me having to sit there and shake it for ten seconds - at first, not a big deal, but do that for a few weeks, and it's incredibly frustrating. I went back to my old mouse. I'll know next time to pay for a better mouse.",2021,10
I have had this mouse for less than 8 weeks. . .it charges. . .doesn't work. At all. Go buy a name brand that will work for more than 15 minutes!,2021,10
"Inexpensive, but the quality matches those of way more expensive mouses!  Also, this mouse has led lights which is very nice.  I will definitely be recommending this to my friends!",2021,10
I like the ergonomic design of this mouse and so far I find it easy and smooth and to use. I can work on it all day long tiredlessly,2021,10
My son loves it!,2021,10
"I was wary of buying a no-name brand mouse, but it turned out to be even better than I expected. It’s super sleek and looks great with the LEDs. It also functions VERY well - the clicks are almost silent (if you’ve used a cheap mouse that has LOUD clicks you’ll know what I’m talking about, haha) and it’s very reactive. I use it for light gaming and it’s perfect. I haven’t even had to charge it yet, which is amazing. Absolutely worth it for the price!!",2021,10
It has already stopped working. The little roller on top stop working,2021,10
Its cute and comfortable but tracks too slowly for gaming,2021,10
The lights on the side of the mouse are not as bright as I thought they would be. But still like the mouse none the less. Quiet clicking. Charges quickly.,2021,10
Just love color,2021,10
"It's what I expected, accept they forgot to put the C adapter in the box. I bout 2 of them the other one had its adapter sooo.. 4 stars for being mostly right.",2021,10
"This mouse was wonderful when it worked, but it stopped after just over a month. It will not hold a charge and is of no use now. Unfortunately the return window has passed. I would not suggest purchasing this item.",2021,10
"As I've just learned by searching questions, after using it for a few weeks, the scroll wheel stops working. Also, these are silly lights for a grownup. They remind me of those kids' shoes that light up when they step. Green, pink, yellow lights are kid or gamer colors. Every time I try to save a buck I regret it. Off to buy a new one...",2021,10
Used a few hours a day for 6 weeks.  It is totally dead!,2021,10
Loved it until the wheel quit after five months,2021,10
"massive waste of money. plus, the red light was extremely bright and couldn't be turned off.",2021,10
"I was surprised how good this mouse, no regrets!",2021,10
Stopped working 2 months after I got it,2021,10
Okay,2021,10
Love it!,2021,10
Works well.,2021,10
"I used this mouse to play Minecraft and not long after I got it , I’d say a month, the mouse it started slowly malfunctioning. This is disappointing considering there were so many good reviews. Now I am in need of another mouse and I wish I could get my money back because I’m not made of money and thought this would last me a while.",2021,10
The wireless mouse with the USC and C size adapter is perfect. The LED lights are a great addition.,2021,10
"Is not the best i have try, but for the price works very good and is pretty accurate",2021,10
"This mouse is almost unusable because of how loud every scroll is. I took the top off to make sure there wasn't something stuck in there to create this awful sound and it was clean. Just poorly designed/cheap. I wasn't expecting the greatest mouse for this low price point, but this is just obnoxious.",2021,10
 I’ve only had the mouse for one month it no longer wants to charge. I have the matte black mouse and the Paint is peeling off.,2021,10
"This looks incredibly cheaply made, and if it drops off my desk I’m positive it will break immediately.",2021,10
"It was the best mouse until charge ran out and it refuses to get charged. It was pretty, dainty and lightweight while it lasted. For exactly a month. Now it’s trash. Of no use. Buy something a couple dollars more but atleast will last for months.",2021,10
Well the color is great but it stopped working after two uses . tryed to charge it and it doesn't even take a charge. Won't try anything from this vendor again.,2021,10
 I bought one of these from this company and it stopped working within the first 2 weeks.I messaged the seller upset because I could not return. I thought maybe buying the “upgraded” version would be best option before making a large complaint because it was a nice mouse for the little time I was able to use it.Big mistake.The second one stopped working within 2 weeks of using it continuously.I can’t return if either to receive my money back or receive a replacement.It’s frustrating because of the fact that I work from home and need a mouse.I am going to make a complaint through Amazon itself. But i wanted to warn others not to waist your money.Good luck!,2021,10
"After one full charge And the charge running out, the battery won’t hold a charge. I’ll leave it plugged in for hours to charge, only for it to die in about 5 minutes of use. Definitely better products out there.",2021,10
"For the price, you can't complain - super low profile, LED lights, works really well, no lag.",2021,10
"After a day or 2, the mouse would not work at all. It was not a problem with the connection, my computer was able to pick up the Bluetooth no problem. THe mouse itself would not work unless it was plugged into some sort of charger....kind of defeats the purpose of a WIRELESS mouse.",2021,10
I just got this mouse and wanted to like it but it glitches so much. To get it to stop I have to turn it off then back on so I can continue working. Will be returning.,2021,10
Had it for one month and not working...,2021,10
Not great quality but it works fine & lights up,2021,10
"It worked fine for a month, today 3 days after the return policy window the cursor dosent work anymore and even with a change of batteries.",2021,10
"It's a cool mouse, the led features are nice and it's pretty, but I hate when I have to move it sporadically for a good 3-5 seconds before the mouse moves on the screen. I've tried different mouse pads, and it still happens. It's extremely frustrating, and it happens as soon as you stop using for any period of time and go back to using it. You have to left and right click numerous times before it will respond now. It also makes an irritating high-pitched noise when you move it.",2021,10
"I have now purchased 2 of these computer mice, both of which have broken and become unusable within just a few weeks. With the first one, I thought I got a defective item, so I returned it and got the same model again for exchange. Now that one has broken too, conveniently just 2 days outside the return window.  In both instances, the click wheel stopped functioning, making scrolling impossible. These were handled with care in my home office, and not used improperly, or dropped, or exposed to moisture, etc. They just seem very cheaply made. The LED lights were a nice feature but meaningless without a functioning mouse. As far as the ergonomics, I often found my hand hurting. The mouse is so low-profile as to be unnatural to hold or maneuver. I do not recommend this product.",2021,10
This mouse is unusable for someone who wishes to work efficiently. It tracks completely erratically and is simply not worth using.,2021,10
"Great item overall, but I wish it uses usb c to charge then micro usb.",2021,10
The mouse I got would make the pointer on the computer move without me moving the mouse and it constantly tried red even when it was on the rainbow setting and fully charged,2021,10
"Initially, I was pleased with the feel and performance of this mouse. It is lighter and slimmer than the typical usb wireless mouse, and it worked well. However, after about two weeks, the scrolling wheel became erratic and it stopped working altogether today, a bit more than three weeks in use. As a result, the mouse became essentially useless and I am returning it.",2021,10
"I love this mouse! It’s small and very quiet. The LED lights are a plus. I got the pink one and it couldn’t be any cuter!! Definitely will buy again, need one at home and work :)",2021,10
Good,2021,10
Works great on my desktop. Good battery life and sleep mode works seemlessly. Good value. Recommend.,2021,10
"It was very jittery on occasion, I went to replace it because it was a quick buy to get me by until I could afford a better solution. Solution. It served a purpose but I wouldn't recommend the purchase if you could avoid it.",2021,10
Not a fan. Have had better for cheaper.,2021,10
The mouse works better then expected. The battery life has exceeded a week so far. If you have a Surface Go2 this mouse will not disappoint. Very happy with this item. Would recommend.,2021,10
"It worked great for 4 weeks, it’s quiet but it stopped working after the window to return closed. It doesn’t charge anymore. Money not well spent.I went back to my old one, never fails.",2021,10
recently started traveling for work and need a good mouse for my laptop to travel withthis does the job and doesn't break the bank i highly recommend,2021,10
Had this mouse less than a week. My kids knocked it off my desk. The mouse broke in half and will not snap back together. Has no durability! Save your money and buy a more reputable brand. My prior mouse was dropped dozens of times with no issues. Will be ordering one from that brand. This one is not worth the money.,2021,10
Worked flawlessly for a few days then the left button became  unreliable. Not worth the hassle to return.Update: Seller emailed me saying that they had corrected the problem and offered a refund if I took down this review. I replied I'd rather have a corrected unit which I would then review. They replied they weren't fixed yet and offered to 2x my refund. I ignored it.,2021,10
"I bought this yesterday to replace a broken mouse. Day 1, has incredibly noticeable lag. I fully charged it before using it. It runs about the same as a turtle stuck in syrup. This isn't worth $15, just buy a different mouse.Update: The brand behind this sent me an email from a shady address claiming to be ""Amazon Custom Service"" and offered me $20 to delete the review. Not a chance. I urge you to stay away from this brand, they're shady af. They'll try to scam you after you buy their scummy product.",2021,10
This product doesn’t work as it should. I literally have to hold the Type C port into my MacBook for it to stay on.,2021,10
Excellent mouse,2021,10
"Ergonomics are great. Quality is okay, very lite weight and made of cheap plastic. Mouse pointer seems jumpy at times for no reason.All in all I would probably spend a little more money if you can or want to so that you get a better quality device.",2021,10
"I really loved this mouse, but 4 months in and it's not working. It lights up, but does not function with my laptop. I'm super disappointed!",2021,10
" While the product looks great, it’s not very ergonomic for me. Noticed pain in my hands after only a few days of usage. Not great for long period usage.",2021,10
"Although we had a quality issue with one of the laces, the vendor fixed our problem and replaced the damaged laces. Happy to give it another shot and hope we have better luck this time!",2021,10
"My return date closed 6 days ago, and the mouse has stopped working completely.",2021,10
After one month and 5 days it stopped turning on. Work fine until it just stop. Left it charging for hours still no luck.,2021,10
Has worked great until now.  I charged it and now it won't turn back on.  Can't return it either.  Not worth the money.,2021,10
It is not response at all. It is very jerky and doesn’t react for several seconds. I have used several cordless mice before but this gets the thumbs down.,2021,10
"Update 02.24.2022: I'm not sure why, but this mouse is working better than it did when I originally purchased it back in October 2021.  I use it EVERY DAY and I don't mind charging it over night every couple of days or so.  It IS comfortable to use, and kind of funky (in a good way) to use the changing lights feature from time to time.  Naturally, this will make the battery run down faster, but once in a while I enjoy the light show...  LOL and I love how the ""click"" is SO QUIET!They say they've upgraded this product so I hope you'll give it a try too.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review October 2021:  My use of this mouse consists of following:6 hours of use (without the pretty little alternating lights on) and then it's switched off for the night.Before my next 6 hours are over, this thing runs out of life and must be charged again.I'm not at all thrilled with it.It does have a nice quiet click, but if I have to charge it every time I use it, I don't think it will last very long....",2021,10
Its worth the price. Really good quality. Easy to install. Very smooth and works perfect. Highly recommend it.,2021,10
Loved the color and the slimness of it. Charging chord came looking like a dog chewed on it.,2021,10
Wire is broken within a month. I contacted seller and got refund immediately. Now they are changing vendor to get a good quality wire.,2021,10
"My younger don first bought this mouse for his Mac mini. Since then we fell in love with it and my wife bought this for her work laptopIt’s nice to get the customization of color and also very ergonomic in use and effective in performanceWe use this mouse in all kinds of setting - desk, lap, bed and even in cars..Never had issuesAwesome and looking forward to 3rd one to buy!!!!",2021,10
Love it but the girls at work lost my charging cord any ideas where i can get another cord other then that this mouse is awesome fast shipping just over all great,2021,10
Mouse works great when you first plug it in but if you wait a few minutes it will lag so much your better off using the laptop mouse. I’m disappointed in these high reviews because mine does not work.,2021,10
Work very well and easy to set up ! You can charge it with your computer the best thing is no need for batteries,2021,10
"It looks nice. But after two months, it did not work anymore. The cursor did not move, even it was fully charged.NOT recommend it.",2021,10
I received this and tried to use it and it lags all over the computer screen. It is horrible. It’s very pretty but does not work. Even tried to charge it for two entire days and still lags.,2021,10
The cursor acts erratically and the left and right buttons respond poorly. One must work twice as hard to use this than any other mouse I have ever had. Seek elsewhere - go to a local store where you can easily return the thing if you need to.,2021,10
"People always ask me about my mouse when I use it at school. Love the colors, love that its rechargeable. Its small and lightweight so its great for what I use it for which is with my laptop at school/in the lab. I've already dropped it a few times and it still works. No complaints.",2021,10
Love everything about it.,2021,10
This mouse has been great. Super quiet when you click and responds well when prompted. The lights add a nice touch and remind you to turn it off for the day!,2021,10
"I am very disappointed in this mouse. while using it, the mouse will constantly stop working and I will have to turn it off and on just to get it to work again. This happens at least 3 times a day. As well, the battery life is not long at all. If I do not charge it every night, it will not work in the morning. Avoid!",2021,10
It is quiet and works well.  I am very happy with the purchase.,2021,10
"Love this mouse. Purchased the mint green for laptop. Works great so far. Dongle was tight to remove but that's ok. Lights change color, make sure to put it on the setting that looks like a sun otherwise ""On"" position will leave lights on red. It was delivered when it was expected.",2021,10
I do you like it so far but it started to come apart at the seam !!  I put it together a bit concerned If it's going to just do this again Must be due to quality I have been very careful with it,2021,10
"The mouse checks all my needs: wireless,  low profile, and inexpensive.I used to have a roller ball mouse but found myself having to frequently clean the ball from lint and dirt so this is a vast improvement.I've used this for a few days now and haven't had to charge it yet so so far so solid.",2021,10
"I wanted to just like it . I mean it worked. But, honestly, it felt like a kids cheap dollar tree toy. I just can’t imagine that it will last long. I should have known better, with the price. Anyway, I returned it.",2021,10
Doesn’t hold a charge for very long,2021,10
"The mouse is not large enough, and does not hold a charge for long.",2021,10
"Dissatisfied , darn thing stopped working",2021,10
Sadly it is not working.,2021,10
Product was great for the first two months. It suddenly just stopped working even though its fully charged. Kinda of a disappointment.,2021,10
Had this mouse for a month and the wheel already stopped working,2021,10
"I purchased this in July and it worked perfectly. It's now ""ass backwards"" You have to hold the button down just in order to move the cursor. If I let go of the button  IT DOES NOTHING. Its completely off track. The LED only works when it's charging. Before it worked whenever it was on the last switch  on the bottom of the mouse.",2021,10
I followed the instructions to the letter and it was slow and laggy.,2021,10
"I bought this mouse specifically for its price and slim profile. I wanted something small and compact that is easy to pack in my laptop bag. This fits the bill.This mouse is perfect for everyday use such as going to websites, using office applications like word, excel and powerpoint etcI would not recommend the mouse for gaming purposes, and that is not what it is meant for anyway.If you want a mouse that works for web browsing/office work on the go, looks nice and is slim and compact get this device!",2021,10
First one was defective.. Seller was fast to send a replacement.  Works with no issue.,2021,10
Color.,2021,10
"I play a lot of pc games and I really enjoy the quiet clicking compared to my old, very loud mouse",2021,10
you get what you pay for this thing is a piece of crap.,2021,10
"This is a very nice mouse for the price. The charge in the battery lasts a long time and the mouse buttons make almost no noise whatsoever. Perfect for use during a lecture at school when you don’t want to disturb the speaker with incessant clicking noises. I’m not sure how this would be for gamers, but the switchable DPI is a very nice feature, as well.Also, I do feel that I should point out that the RGB lights are switchable on and off, which is a nice feature if you are like me and are in a class where the room goes dark for presentations and video clips.",2021,10
I bought this mouse back in July to use with my laptop when I was in class. This would equate to a few hours each week. The mouse stopped working after about a month and I charged it overnight. The blue light never turned off and now the mouse will not turn on or work at all. Such a bummer because I really liked everything about it.,2021,10
I only use this mouse about 10 hours a week and it has already broke. It won’t turn on or charge. You get what you pay for.,2021,10
"Alot of people said the mouse was loud, didnt work, or what ever else, its FALSE the mouse is super quiet, my mouse at work is loud and obnoxious, this isnt. The colors are great i was sad cause it didnt turn pink lol but that is my only complaint. Its a great mouse, some of yall expect way too much from something cheep. You get what you pay for but this mouse is great!",2021,10
then it continued to be a cheap piece of junk. I mean I should have known from the price it was to good to be true. I never got it to charge or do anything. Returned.,2021,10
"didn't last, it stopped working already",2021,10
"Noiseless, very light, and comfortable mouse. But... There was a card in the same box saying  ”if you will write a review, we will return the money spent on the mouse”. That's not true!!! I spent time going through this process for nothing! Do not believe them! I was disappointed.",2021,10
Nice,2021,10
It moves well and I like that I can turn it off if I’m not using it.,2021,10
Ergonomic,2021,10
"When I first received the mouse it worked well and I enjoyed the multi-colors.  However, after 1 month it constantly needed to be charged.  By three months it no longer cycled the different colors, but was only red.  Now at the 7 month mark it no longer tracks, I move the mouse but my cursor doesn't move on the screen.  I've never had a mouse go bad this quickly.  I will not be purchasing this mouse again.",2021,10
"Worked great at first, but now the right click button does nothing.  I am back to my track pad.  Avoid this device, cheap components",2021,10
"I purchased this item in August. The USB plug completely fell apart, and I can no longer use the mouse.",2021,10
I have no complaints about this mouse. I use it daily and it works great. I love the fact it has LED lights. I recommend this product.,2021,10
The mouse is slim which is nice. It seems to be made of a thinner plastic which feels flimsy. But over all it's pretty good for the price,2021,10
"I wasted my money on buying two of these wireless led mouse.  They literally only lasted one week.  I charged them, the only activity is a prompt red flashing light.  I purchased a high end, well name brand wireless mouse.",2021,10
The box was torn and there is a scratch/ smudge on it.  I hope it works well.The colors are beautiful though.  I love how the white mouse looks.  It's very clean.  4 stars because of the smudge I can't get off and packaging.  It's obvious I'm not the first one to own it.,2021,10
The charging port is terribly built only worked for a month,2021,10
For a year the mouse did well however it eventually needed charged in less time frames  It finally shorted out. This was my 2nd purchase after the first shorted out within a few weeks. A permanent sleep mode!,2021,10
"Got the mouse hooked up and at first it didn't work. Light up but rgb function and connection to pc didn't work. Figured out it needed to sit and fully charge for everything to work. Mouse was doing great until I found a issue with its sleep mode. When the mouse falls asleep to save battery, it wakes up very quickly. However from that point on its control over the cursor becomes delayed. It's ping is tripled and you can watch the cursor stick and then start to move again while moving the mouse. I turned the mouse off and back on again to resolve this problem. So the sleep feature on this mouse is terrible. Have to turn it on and off as needed.",2021,10
"I bought these for my classroom, I have Sixteen total. They are constantly connecting to each others receivers and some just losing connection and not reconnecting after sleep mode. I think it's a good office mouse for anyone who isn't using it in a setting where a lot of them are being used. Do not buy if you need more than one.",2021,10
"It needs to be charged daily, as I use it all day at work. I do like the color changing light, it brightens up my day!",2021,10
It does what it’s supposed to do… Works as a wireless mouse. Beautiful color and works like a charm.,2021,10
"Good product, timely shipping.",2021,10
It doesn’t work correctly connection is bad,2021,10
"This is a very nice product. The mouse does not need a pad, can work on the bare desk, on a sheet of paper, etc. My device does not have multiple LEDs, only red (or the software I use does not employ all its features) but there is no need to complain. Will buy again without hesitation.",2021,10
I got this for my daughter for school. It is perfect and appeals to her teenage likes,2021,10
Worst wireless mouse I have ever purchased.  The lag time to respond to movement is horrble.  Clicking is even worse.  Sometimes I have to click three or four times before the mouse works.  I tried on multiple systems just to be sure it was not an issue with one laptop.  Do not purchase.  A complete waste of money and time.,2021,10
I really wanted to like this mouse as it’s lightweight and cute but it’s not worth it when the mouse charge dies quickly and since it’s not compatible with my MacBook I can’t use it while charging since I have to use the same adapter for both sensor and charging. Also lights stopped changing colors and you can’t set to one color.,2021,10
"I loved this mouse. It was slick and easy to use. However it was not once I used on a regular basis. I only used it may 1 hour max each day. The charge did not hold and here I am, less than a year in and it no longer holds a charge.  I tried to return but not accepted.",2021,10
"This mouse is terrible. Super glitchy. The mouse clicks on things your not clicking on, you put the curser on something and go to click it and it glitches and clicks something else. Not recommend",2021,10
Easy to use.  I was hoping the mouse would be taller.  Works ok,2021,10
"It works, and it’s cheap so there’s that. Not a great mouse by any means, but then again it was also like $10 so I’m not mad",2021,10
"A month after use and after a charge or two, the mouse is not longer usable. The battery is completely dead and will not charge. Completely unusable and a waste.",2021,10
"Nice low silhouette and quiet action. Does what is expected of a mouse and is good looking to boot. Obviously cannot judge it’s ergonomic qualities from such a short term of usage, but it appears to be no strain at all on my wrist and fingers. Holds a charge well. The only caveat I might mention is that the dongle is a bit too short for if you’re using while charging, but that is a minor issue. Well pleased with this mouse.",2021,10
"Works great, rechargeable, and pretty for my girls 😊",2021,10
Regularly stops tracking movement into a disjoint and jerky cursor movement. Seems to depend on the color of the surface underneath (based on my multicolor mousepad).OEM harassed me with emails about changing my review. Amazon leaked my email that was only given to Amazon.,2021,10
I work from home and have to run more than one screen and this mouse was amazing when I bought it. Now it has decided that it doesn’t want to charge and is currently useless after only 5 week. I was about to buy another one for my mom but have canceled it now since this one has stopped working. It sucks because it’s such a fun mouse. It also never leaves my home office so I know it’s not from packing or moving it around a lot,2021,10
"The mouse is ergonomically comfortable and I like the cool lights. However, difficult to enjoy these features when the mouse doesn’t work. The first one had a defective left click button. I ordered a replacement because I really wanted to like this mouse. I got the replacement and less than two weeks later, the scroll wheel stopped working.",2021,10
This is just the second day since I got this mouse for my laptop and it doesn't work anymore. I LOST MY MONEY,2021,10
Convenient and quiet mouse,2021,10
At home for personal use,2021,10
This mouse only stayed charged for 2 hours if that long. Not very helpful when working 8 hours a day.,2021,10
Battery life is terrible and mouse stops working from time to time. No idea how this product has such high reviews.,2021,10
"Just literally snap in usb and go. Easy to hold, light weight, lights up, perfect all around design. Quality is excellent. Just what I needed in a mouse!",2021,10
Works great!,2021,10
Everything,2021,10
Recommend it!,2021,10
Cheap and awful product,2021,10
"Just like the title says, died out of nowhere 20 days after the return window and warranty were up. I tired it on two PCs and one laptop. It still lights up, but won't connect. JUNK!",2021,10
Mouse was very light and would t keep a charge. Adapter broke a week after I got it.,2021,10
Doesn't hold charge very long.  Hard to click - use.  Stopped working all together.  Have gone back to wired mouse.  Much easier to use.,2021,10
This mouse is wonderful and easy to use without a mouse pad which is a big plus. Bought this to replace my old wireless mouse because the usb plug is shorter and does't stick out the side of my laptop to far. It is rechargeable and lasts for a while thanks to the sleep function which is easy to exit from. Love that you can choose to have it light up and changes colors. Totally worth the buy!,2021,10
Used this mouse for a week and the scroll roller is already broken.,2021,10
I hate this mouse. Doesn’t stay charged and sleep mode kicks in too quickly,2021,10
"I was impressed with the first 2 I’ve bought for my boys, had to get a 3rd for myself. No problems connect mouse to my laptop, love the lights on it. Easy to glide, easy to use",2021,10
"Good price, funky colors, clearly starts stuttering in response time when it's ready to be charged. Perfect for my tiny home-office kitchen counter space!",2021,10
"I got this mouse for a friend, and he loved it. Very sleek and the colors just overall look amazing. Awesome purchase!",2021,10
"After 2 weeks it just completely stopped working. Tried 4 different chargers and nothing. It was a good price and loved the lights, but should have just grabbed one from the dollar store if this is the quality of the product😑",2021,10
"Came ready to use, starting using straight from box. It is convenient, and ergonomic friendly.",2021,10
Of course 2 weeks after return window closes the mouse stops working. Slow movement and doesn’t respond to commands. Waste of plastic.UPDATE: Seller offered to make this right.  Awaiting final resolution,2021,10
I like this wireless mouse for now. Hoping nothing goes wrong with it. So far it's been very dependable and works correctly. The design is perfect and I love the different colors. It works the moment you connect the USB connector to the computer and turn the mouse on. The only thing I don't like is how quickly it goes into sleep mode. But that's not too big of an annoyance.,2021,10
"The mouse just feels odd in my hand. It's serviceable, but when it dies I'm not buying another.",2021,10
After 2 months of using this mouse it just stopped working out of nowhere and it’s fully charged. Also experience the random jumping of the cursor before it left this life and went to mouse heaven. Would no recommend.,2021,10
"I love that it change colors. It’s sleek, and easy to control. I will most definitely order another one.",2021,10
It is NOTHING like it’s advertised!! I’ve charged it… then it wouldn’t work… so I charged it again… and it’s STILL not doing anything!!!! I’m so aggravated!! 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻😤😤😤,2021,10
It’s nice not to have to worry about replacing batteries.,2021,10
Just what I needed and I like the colors. Real sleek in hand,2021,10
"***Update 12/10/21*** This mouse is garbage. I wrote my review after one day of good functionality, but the rechargeable battery seems to only last one day before it starts being jerky and responding inconsistently, buttons don't always work when I click something. If I take out the USB and turn on/off the mouse it fixes it for a few minutes until it goes into sleep mode. The first one they sent me didn't work at all and this new one just doesn't work. It works better if the mouse is plugged in but the cord is short and stiff. Ordering something else.The mouse works great for my Dell laptop. Fits comfortably, sleek profile, no problems. The button is still audible but quieter than my last mouse. I had an issue with my first shipment, but customer service was very responsive, problem-solved with me, and then shipped me a new mouse very quickly.",2021,10
"But the item Jul 2021, 6 months i didnt chrage it more than 4 times yet the charger broke. Its nice but wont last",2021,09
"This mouse is good for its price. Its light, and the clicking mechanism is actually quite nice. When you press down it's more of a subtle, soft click which I like a lot, rather than an annoying and loud click. However, it does feel a little cheap when you hold it and quality of the plastic is pretty low. When using the LED mode you can practically see inside the mouse. Once again though, for $15, it's not bad! I like it because I can connect it to my Macbook air too, which uses an USB-C.",2021,10
"I love the sleek design of this mouse.  My favorite aspect, though, is the quiet clicking - the noise is muted and that is an unexpected bonus!",2021,10
Beyond what I expected bought 2 more,2021,10
It works great. Smooth and quiet. Comfortable and fun,2021,10
Cheap quality.,2021,10
"Pretty flimsy, but still a good mouse for the price.",2021,10
" Works great, really light, great looking",2021,10
Basic mouse at a reasonable price.,2021,10
"Broke after one month, went to plug it in and the charging port pushed way back inside the mouse and when I opened the mouse up to fix it the piece had busted off completely.",2021,10
" In all honesty, there is very little practical value added by colorful light changes for a mouse, but you know what?  In this time of the pandemic, we can all use a bit of quirky and interesting little patches of fun and joy -- especially visually.  This little mouse (I got the gold color because it was the least expensive at the time) always brings a smile.  Btw, it IS quiet -- no noisy clicks, the color is beautiful and classic, and the feel is very ergonomic and no stress on the hand and fingers. If you're still on the fence -- get one (or more) if you want to give yourself a little (and very useful) treat.",2021,10
I've had this about a month and it's struggling to hold a charge and the mouse is jumping. There is also no option to return!! I'll be going back to a regular battery operated one as rechargeable is just not reliable. Dissapointed!,2021,10
"I work from home and in the office.  I have to transport my laptop and mouse.  I have forgotten my mouse more time that I can remember at the office.  I bought 2 of these so I can keep 1 at home and 1 at the office.  They only hold a charge for less than a week.  It might have to do with it having lights on it, but my other mouse holds a charge of heavy usage for a month.  Will not buy again as I need something to hold a charge much longer.",2021,10
Exactly what I was looking for. Sleek and quiet and also pretty with the lights! You can turn the rainbow lights off if you don’t want them on.,2021,10
"I was used to buying name brand 'mouses'.  And I was worried about the size of this device. But actually its a good size just with a lower profile.  Works very well and sleeps and wakes up when you push the button on top.  The lighting is nice, not real bright but just a strip around the outside and the button lights up.  Changes color which is a nice touch.  So I actually like it better than the other larger mouses I have.",2021,10
"You get what you pay for. If you just need a quick mouse on the go so you don’t need a touch pad, this is great. Enduring use of everyday mouse, spend the money for one that is lightweight, ventilated, ergonomic, or a combination. This one, soft clicks, decent feedback, good battery. Just not super high quality for the desk job",2021,10
This broke after 3 weeks.poorly put together.,2021,10
"Super awesome looking mouse, however stopped working about month into having it. Not an ideal purchase.",2021,09
CANT figure it out & won’t sync . Sucks .,2021,09
"I needed a couple of these for my kids for their laptops. I knew they would like the vibrant colors the mouse shows while you are using it and that I would love the rechargeable and quiet functionality. The mouse definitely has exceeded my expectations of it and I couldn't be more pleased at this product. The ergonomic fit and soft, quiet buttons make the experience using this mouse very easy going. I've burned through many a mouse myself, some very expensive name brand ones that should've done their job and then some but I've always found a defect in them down the road. So far so good with these and I could see the durability of this product especially given my twin 7 year olds will use them to their fullest. Great customer service to top it off and I highly recommend this mouse for anyone in need of one or is looking for the right one.",2021,09
Easy to use and function. Sleek easy to handle design. I don’t know about family but good for office work.,2021,09
This mouse is so silent. I really like thatAnd it's super light... Glad I made this purchase.. The lights are supe  cool.. Easy to install and use...Worth the money!!,2021,09
It works really good and I like the fact that theres no batteries and you plug it in to charge it!,2021,09
"Needed a new mouse for my laptop, something that was easy to store and easy to use. The mouse is easy to set up, battery life is satisfactory, and DPI choice is good. The LED colors are a nice touch too",2021,09
Works good very comfortable when using it for work and gaming battery life is about 33hrs I say that because it almost lasted a full work week.,2021,09
"I love the mouse. It's a great fit for me, it has options for both hands, is quiet, and the color (I ordered mint green) is exactly what was shown/ what I wanted. The LED lights run briefly when that option is selected, but then seem to shut off (I thought they would run continuously). Maybe if I use it for longer periods it could have an effect. I'll see what happens.The biggest issue is that the USB-C adapter does not fit in my computer or my phone. The little pamphlet that comes with the mouse says to contact their customer service email first with any questions/problems. I emailed them the day I got the mouse (four days ago) but so far have no response.",2021,09
I didn’t find this easy to use.,2021,08
I bought the wrong mouse to my computer. it isn't smooth and hard to control mouse on screen computer.,2021,09
This mouse was for my son for his school laptop. He loves having it at school with the cool lights and it makes working on homework much more fun! Works great!,2021,09
"THIS IS A VERY POOR QUALITY ITEM, THAT LASTS JUST OVER THE 30 DAYS WARRANTY AND WILL NEVER RECHARGE.  BUY SOMETHING ELSE",2021,09
" I purchased this mouse for the style and cooler, but after using it, it was better than expected. It is silent which I prefer when using in class. And the LED light features makes it look even cooler.",2021,09
"With in the span of one week it broke. First intermittent hiccups, flickering light and then none functional. The good thing is that it broke soon enough to be returned to Amazon.",2021,09
USB fell apart after 2 uses.,2021,09
When I use it the pointer jumps around alot.,2021,09
"So I bought two different mouse to use, one for my laptop and one for my pc. The originally bought this one for my desktop to match my RGB but I enjoy using it with my laptop much better. It is the perfect size for my hand. You cannot go wrong at this price for what you get! I enjoy the noiseless aspect and the light weight feel.",2021,09
Bought the rose gold one to match my laptop and while it's not a perfect match it's still very pretty and I love the lights! It is a very silent when clicking and very responsive when moving the mouse.Update:So I received this mouse exactly 10 days ago and the scroll button is broke. I went to try to take it apart to fix it and even with the correct size screwdriver (Very small btw) it just stripped the screw because it was so tightly screwed in. so not only did my brand new less than 2 week old mouse break they made it impossible to fix it by making a fort nox screw. not happy save your money.,2021,09
"It does everything I ordered it to do for a good price. rechargeability is a huge plus to me for a wireless mouse, the clicks are satisfying, and it feels nice to hold. My only gripe is that the lights on it are a bit weak, but I honestly don't care about that in the slightest and that's not why I bought it so it's not a big deal.",2021,09
"PERFECT,  no complaints. Super cute color changes. I never charge it and it's only died once and I use it for work about 10 hours a day and seems like I charge it like 2 times a week.",2021,09
waste of your money,2021,09
I liked this mouse for comfort and look. The roller ball literally fell into the mouse rendering the entire mouse useless 7 months after I purchased it. Disappointing.,2021,09
"I loved it, at first. But the mouse started making a squeaking noise when I used the roller. It was very annoying in class.",2021,09
"Worst mouse ever. It double clicks when I do not want it to. The mouse barely moves and is jerky when used and often makes the cursor slide to the upper right of the screen, without me moving the mouse.",2021,09
Sleek Looking with lights but scroller on one did not work.,2021,09
Worked great after first charge then became choppy and uncontrollable. Very disappointed in this mouse.,2021,09
My mouse has stop working already. I had the mouse for two months and already it has stop working. This was a waste of money.,2021,09
I have two problems. No matter how long you charge it for it’s dead in an hour. That’s if it been works.  The usb plug in takes two people to get out and I’m afraid it will get stuck and ruin my computer.  The appearance is great but it doesn’t work and could break the USB port. Because of this I do not recommend.Since this posted the company offered 40$ To change review instead of just sending another mouse. Clearly they know there product does not work.,2021,09
"Great product, excellent seller! Thank you!!!",2021,09
Mac book pro mouse never worked. Money refunded,2021,09
"This mouse is very cheaply made and did not function properly right out of the box. It will move the cursor around and scroll, but it will not click on anything, right or left click. Ridiculous! I want to return it, but the hassle of dealing with it isn’t worth getting the money back since it was so cheap to begin with. Should have known to go for a more expensive and reputable brand like Logitech!",2021,09
"After just three months, this mouse no longer charges. So, it's useless. Spend a few extra dollars and get a better mouse.",2021,09
wheel broke inside from minimal use; unable to put back on so the scrolling option no longer works.,2021,09
"It was so pretty for the first few hours after charging with the changing lights and standby light mode.  Then the next morning after turning it off, it would not turn back on, so I put it on the charging cord... for DAYS!!! and nope nothing.... Save your money and purchase something else and make sure it takes batteries.  This is garbage that has a pretty face on it.  If i still had the box it came in I would be getting a full refund and send it back.",2021,09
The scroll wheel doesn’t work,2021,09
I love this mouse. It fits my hands perfect. I use it a lot and haven't had any problems.,2021,09
"I bought this mouse in June,  a month later the wheel stopped working.  I like the gold color and the smoothness of it, but the wheel is something that I would consistently need to use .",2021,09
It does not recharge,2021,07
"I have purchased this mouse twice and each time it has phased out on me after about 2-3 months of use. It stopped holding a charge and I cold only use it while it was plugged in which defeats the meaning of wireless. Then it completely went out on me and I can no longer use the mouse at all even when it is on the charging cable. I have gone through the customer reviews looking for fixes and nothing.Update: Now I'm being offered money to remove my comment. $40-45. No I will not. I can care less about my money back I want what I paid for and a refund shouldn't be contigent upon removing my comment. Again, don't buy.",2021,09
The mouse itself still works but the USB port has just broken in a million pieces. My laptop stays at home and it is what I use as my home computer. After about a month of use the USB port is just the piece that pushes into the laptop and the plastic tip is just gone. One more break and it will either be stuck in my computer or I will be unable to use the mouse.,2021,09
"Was a great mouse until it stopped working, which was less than 2 months after I purchased it.  It was used and charged as per instructions, then it suddenly stopped functioning all together.  Would not purchase again, because even with its low cost, it's not worth it to only get 2 months use out of it.  Do not recommend.",2021,09
"It works well looks pretty and very smooth to use, good buy",2021,09
"i think this mouse is great! I love the LED colors changing. It goes to sleep after a little while to save battery life. It's very simple to charge if it ever needs it. My only thing about it (and it's not even negative about the device) is that my hands are very big so this seems a little tinier than I'd like. Still though, I got no complaints about it.",2021,09
"Bought this mouse for work because I didn't want to use the corded mouse my company gave me.Not even two months in, the mouse scroller BREAKS. Never dropped the mouse, never did anything but charge it twice a week and use it for work. Had to overnight ship a completely different mouse for work the next day. Very disappointed because I really liked the mouse and I had even told my coworkers to buy this. I'm glad they didn't waste their money like I did...",2021,09
Bought this for my husband. He was very pleased with it. Works just fine and comes as described.,2021,09
The design is pretty but the functionality is crappy. My mouse censor keeps glitching in and out which makes it impossible to work with. Definitely will be returning which is really annoying because it took forever to arrive and it was supposed to be a replacement for my previous wireless mouse that fell to its death from the 2nd floor last week.,2021,09
"For the money, this mouse is a great value! I needed a new mouse, as the click on my old brand name mouse was begging to ""miss"".  I wanted something fairly inexpensive, wireless and rechargeable. I am tired of having to switch out batteries. This mouse fit all those perfectly.  My first month impression is .. it's excellent.  After the initial charge, it's still going strong with maybe an hour a day usage, after 3 weeks.  It goes to ""sleep"" after a period of inactivity, which helps to conserve the battery.  My only gripe, would be the slim profile.  I think I prefer a little more bulk in my palm.  My only contact with the mouse when navigating, is with my fingers, no palm contact.  This does not deduct from my rating as it is clearly advertised as a slim profile design.  All in.. I am glad I purchased this mouse.  If this company develops a full contoured model, I would surely upgrade.",2021,09
Poor quality. Cheap. Breaks quickly. Doesn’t last long on a full charge. Charging port already broke.,2021,09
"At first I really loved this mouse - fast connection and worked well. But like several other reviews mentioned, after about 8-9 months, it just stopped working. It didn’t charge or anything, it just literally stopped working. For that alone, I would rate it a bad pedi to because it doesn’t last. I didn’t drop it or beak it, it simply stopped working.",2021,09
Not well made.  Very light and flimsy. Returned it.,2021,09
Great,2021,09
"Pros:Surprisingly, the battery charge lasts me a looooong time. I think it lasted me a month on one charge!!!One of the cheapest in the market.Cons:The first one i got didn’t work.The replacement one worked but sometimes the scroll is backwards.",2021,09
"Despite the description saying it was Macbook compatible it wasn’t. I have the Macbook Air with the M1 chip. Regardless, it’s a nice mouse and it’s quite as described and does work on PC. I was able to test it on my PC.",2021,09
"The item is actually nice. The size, color and lights are very cute. And I love that is rechargeable. The only issue I encounter was that when you leave it idle for a few seconds and then try to use it, it gets super slow and lags. I have to turn it off and back on to have the speed back to normal. I don't know if that is a feature to save power, or if mine is defective. I'll try to reach out to the seller. Has anyone else experienced this issue?",2021,09
Battery won’t stay charged very long,2021,09
stagnant mouse movement. dont buy this if you use your mouse often.,2021,09
Came broken then I forgot to return in time.,2021,09
"This mouse was nice when it worked. I received the first one and it wouldn't charge or turn on at all, so I returned it and got it replaced. The second one worked for a few weeks and now it doesn't charge or stay on either.",2021,09
I like it seems nice and easy to use it,2021,09
Broke as soon as it dropped on the floor.,2021,09
This is a total waste of money as it stopped working after two weeks. So dissappointed with this product.,2021,09
 Great mouse. Fits my hand. Easy to use,2021,09
"only worked for three days, now won't charge",2021,09
I ordered TWO and within a one time use neither one of them works any longer. What kind of a horrid product is this company supplying a company like AMAZON with? AND they are not cheap by any means!!So disappointed in Amazon allowing this product to be sold on their site. I have never been so distraught with any of my purchases with Amazon EVER - BUT THIS ONE really places shame on Amazon.I would like full replacement for both because I have TWO work PCS for my job; one for the USA and another PC for accounts out of the country (Latin America) - that was the purpose for purchasing two.,2021,09
Good mouse for my laptop. Great feel and comfortable!,2021,09
easy to use,2021,09
I love it 😍,2021,09
"The first day it worked great, but the second day it barely tracks at all and when I try and click on anything to open documents or emails, it takes several tries before it works!!What a waste of money, I'm going back to my old mouse!!!",2021,09
"I loved this mouse until it quit working, three weeks after using. I am unable to return it due to return window. Tried different mouse pads and notebooks hoping I was just the material it was sensitive to.",2021,09
Sucks. Broke in 1 month,2021,09
Mouse is generic and seems like it worked a couple of times then it was just never working good after that.,2021,09
This wireless mode has a nice sleek design. I purchased the matte design. I love that the clicks are quieter than others. I didn’t think It mattered that much but it does. No problems with cursor speed or connectivity. I enjoy the change of colors. Feels more expensive than it actually is. Excellent price!,2021,09
"I bought this mouse a few months ago, and the USB receiver broke. However, I contacted the seller about the issue, and they sent me a new mouse, at no cost.",2021,09
Thé mouse sucks. Only worked 1 day after that it never worked again. Never buying it again.,2021,09
I absolutely love how vibrant the lights are and how light weight the mouse is. I work from home and use this alot.,2021,09
If you had that I've never ending need to have a wireless mouse that has led colors on it that needs to be constantly plugged in for it to work then this is for you.  The charge on it will last approximately 7 hours before it's dead.  If you turn off the pretty lights then maybe it will last 12 hours.  Really not a functional wireless mouse.  Don't buy it.,2021,09
"I wouldn't recommend this mouse, the USB adapter came apart from the computer its JUNK.",2021,09
"This wireless mouse is a good size with great compatibility with my mac. It's a great price, and color matches my cover. Highly recommend for those that just need an everyday mouse :)",2021,09
worrks well,2021,09
"This mouse worked well for a while (3-4 months) but now it is very unreliable. I switched USB ports, got an extender thinking the connector was blocked by my metal desk. 🤷‍♀️That helped some, but it lags, and the click only works about half the time. I have a classroom full of first graders who are waiting on my silly mouse to get it together so I can show them the next slide or open the video for them. It has been SUPER frustrating. I will be purchasing another brand.",2021,09
It was very helped,2021,09
"Finally, a sleep mode that is done right! ALL my other wireless mice when they go to sleep you have to click to wake, pretty standard. Well, when I wake those other mice with a right or left click it is a active click. Which means it acts as if it was never asleep and either opens a menu or activates what I clicked. Always frustrated me LOL!Well this one is super nice, you click and it's awake without doing an activation or selection. I have been looking for this in a wireless mouse and have finally found it!Also, it has a nice feel, not super ergonomic, but nice. The color selection is nice, I chose the grey. The RGB lights are very pleasant to the eyes. I haven't had it long enough to rate the length of the internal rechargeable battery but I will update soon. The cable that comes with the mouse is very short, but that isn't a problem. The DBI variety is nice as well. Very happy with this mouse!",2021,09
I have used this for 18 days (realistically less bc it’s only used M-F). It won’t hold a charge now and dies before lunch despite being plugged up over night.,2021,09
"This is the best mouse that I've used in a long time. No batteries needed, just charge it when needed. I've used this for a little over a day and it's doing great!",2021,09
"The product lasts about 15 minutes and dies, I have charged it so many times and it still needs to be plugged in to work. Even when plugged in it still only lasts another 10 minutes.-Seller is in violation of Amazon’s terms of agreement; continually contacting customer’s private email asking to remove review. Review is factual and customer will continue to report abuse to Amazon through email community-help@amazon.com. Do not purchase product due to poor quality and unregulated customer service practices.",2021,09
I bought this mouse for home use.  I used it about two hours per day for two weeks.  Then no connection.. I thought it needed to be charged.  plugged it in and allowed to sit for two hours as instructed.  Now there is NOTHING.  Tried to charge longer but nothing is working!  DO NOT BUY THIS POS!!!!!,2021,09
"I bought this mouse less than a month ago and I loved it. But now, the roller is making a terrible squeaking sound.",2021,09
"Mouse is comfortable to use. Silent clicks. However, failed after only 2 months of use. I use every day for maybe a couple of hours at a time. Turned off when not in use and plugged in when necessary. Died about a week ago after having for only 2 months. Would not recharge. Will not use a  rechargeable mouse again. Would rather use rechargeable batteries.",2021,09
"Just got a new macbook, it works well with it. Good quality for  the price.",2021,06
"This mouse is awful. I bought 2, six weeks ago and one of them died in less than a week. The other just died. I got less than 2 months out of these and now I have to go looking again for a more reliable one.Avoid this - it looks nice but it doesn't last",2021,09
I needed a new mouse because the one I had been using was so old and was unreliable. This new one is so nice for such a great price! It fits my hand comfortably and has super quiet clicks which is super nice. It charges instead of using batteries which is a feature that I LOVE!! So excited to keep using this product!,2021,09
The charger was a real pain. My kids stopped using it the 2nd week,2021,09
I use this all day during work and then I use it to play the sims I the evening or on the weekend. It charges quickly and the battery lasts so long. I love that the mouse automatically goes into sleep mode because I often forget to turn it off. The matte finish is sleek and comfortable. I have no complaints,2021,09
I work from home and this is a great mouse overall! It’s super slim and it lights up but it’s not super bright that it’s bothering you.,2021,09
Just a quick note. Linux compatible out of the box. Nice mouse,2021,09
"Received this in end of July, already dead.  No longer charges, nothing!",2021,09
Doesn’t work and won’t charge. Cheap.,2021,09
I am really happy with the purchase of this mouse. I had been looking for a good mouse that cheap and wireless. This is the best fit. I am able to carry this everywhere and has long lasting battery. Also the range of the Bluetooth is really good because I was able to control my computer while I was another room,2021,09
"This mouse is quiet as advertised, so it's nice as someone sleeps in my office while I do schoolwork most of the time. The sleep mode on it is nice, but I feel it triggers too soon. That being said, it's bothersome, but not a deal breaker. I was concerned about the quality upon receiving it as it is quite light and feels cheaply made (I'm sure it is), but it's traveled in my laptop case quite successfully without incident, knock on wood. I'm sure if dropped or enough pressure was put on it, it could very well break or crack, but if you treat it well, I don't see why this mouse shouldn't last you. I've had it for about a month now and the only thing I can complain about is the sleep timer, so take that as you will.",2021,09
I got this mouse for work. It works great however it needs to be charged and unfortunately it can’t be used with battery it’s only usb charger so the only down side of this if u work with it for 4-5 days u will need to charge it or it will die on u and u have to keep charging it in ur laptop to keep using it! It’s unfortunately not for me and I don’t like how it doesn’t have battery or dies fast!,2021,09
"With the price, I was skeptical, but this mouse really does work well. As soon as I plugged in the USB, it took all of 15 second before I could start using it. The clicks are smooth and quiet, and it feels great ergonomically. The lights also look really good. I highly recommend it.",2021,09
"It won’t charge at all, two weeks after I bought it and it’s already useless. The blue light turns off like it’s charged but it’s totally dead. Tried different cables and it just doesn’t work",2021,09
Only have had this mouse for 2 months and already have to replace it. The charging port on the mouse no longer staying in place and therefore not charging. The port is wobbling around not making contact to charge. Going back to battery operated wireless mouse.,2021,09
"I waited a while to leave a review. I tought it would last, but it didn't. It was really smooth and long lasting battery. Little did i know while using it it would become apart internally. The scrollwheel broke. I usually fix my electronics easily, sometimes things just need a little adjustment but, this part broke and with no fixing. Maybe some of you are lucky and doesn't break easily. Mine did and not even 3 weeks of using it.",2021,09
"After a month and a half of buying this wireless mouse, the piece where you charge it, is broken. I have been extremely careful with it, and never dropped it. Loved it, but poor quality. Don’t buy it.",2021,09
Broken out of the box.,2021,09
Half the time there is about 1s delay after moving a mouse and moving the curser.,2021,09
I purchased this mouse to use with a chrome book. It pairs well and I have no complaints. I'm a night owl who prefers the darkness so the color changing led lights was a nice option that goes well with a night of cram studying. I would totally try more of their products.,2021,09
"Adorable little mouse...however...the darn thing will be on and won't do anything. I know to click to wake it (if it's in sleep mode) but half the time it won't be asleep and I have to click like 5 times for it to start actually working. Unfortunately, I'll have to find another mouse because this has become an irritating inconvenience.",2021,09
"The mouse look and feel is nice and sleek but it does not slide well due to the bottom strips coming off and restricting the movement. Unfortunately has to go back.The seller keeps contacting me, offering money to remove the review.",2021,09
"I think this is the best mouse i have used, really love it!",2021,09
"Just bought near end of July. Already having issues. Battery drains extremely fast, pointer has tracking issues, won’t click most of the time  have to repeatedly click on something for it to work.",2021,09
Battery died after 15mins with or without the color changing lights on. This thing is useless,2021,09
I won't waste money on these with no batteries ever again. Junk,2021,09
"I love this ergonomic mouse, it fits my hand perfectlyThe lightning colors are a plus and much fun, now my husband wants the same mouse.I have had many mouses in the past, but this one is my favorite, by far.",2021,09
I would not recommend this item I bought this for my daughter for school it quit working after two weeks I was going to buy another one but I decided to wait to see how this one would work I’m so glad I didn’t buy another one when I put it on the charger it does not work I would not recommend this item at all if you buy it you’re wasting your money we liked it because the light so I tried to put it onto another charger and it did not work either so I don’t know what the problem is I would not recommend this do not buy it.  Here’s an update  I keep receiving emails from the seller wanted me to change my review I don’t think that’s how it should work because the item did not work they want me to change my review to good review or they want me to delete it and pay me money for it so now this is the second email I have received the first email they wanted to pay me $10 the second email they want to pay me $20 when you buy something online your post to do a review of your item so I do not recommend this item,2021,09
Wheel stopped working after return period.  No mistreatment.,2021,09
"The ergonomics are good, but it has a fatal flaw that makes it unusable.  When you first turn it on, it works fine.  But after 5 minutes or so, it becomes very ""twitchy"" or""jerky"" and completely unusable.I tried it on both Macs and PCs.  Same problem with both systems.It's too cheap to bother sending back, but I want to warn others not to make the same mistake.",2021,09
This is my favorite mouse because of the color and lighting. It is so cute and comfy to use! There is a charger to charge which I prefer over battery.,2021,09
Works well! He loves the lights.,2021,09
Really great little mouse. Good clicking and control. The battery lasts me a 3-4 days at work between charges. Get this mouse.,2021,09
Quit working after 1.5 month. Not worth the money paid.):,2021,09
we love it great product i actually wish i had a discount so i can order 2 more,2021,09
I didn't know it was possible to like a mouse so much! It is very comfortable and smooth. The battery life is pretty long. I don't like having to charge it because sometimes I forget to plug it in and then it goes dead. The battery life usually last around a week. As long as I can remember to charge it it is fantastic.,2021,09
I used this mouse once and it died after an hour .. was on the charger literally over night .. now i can’t even get it to charge at all .. waste of my money!,2021,09
Bought thus for my daughter with a new gaming computer. She loves it and the colors match her headphones,2021,09
"Wish you could have the option to not have the led color lights on all of the time, or a way to just pick one and not have the constant circulation. Looks bad during the day",2021,09
"I ordered this mouse.  I really liked it - It was slim, fit nicely in my hand and I loved how the lights changed colors.  After a few months, there was a problem with it.  When the company found out they gladly refunded me my purchase price with no questions asked.  Great customer service.  I would order it again after dealing with them if I hadn't already bought another mouse because I had work to finish.  I give them 5 stars",2021,09
Straight out of the package I had issues but figured I would hold on. The mouse does not move smoothly. Cannot click on things and then the mouse would move only intermittenly. Then it would stop and I would have to jerk it around.. and now it has just stopped. Just upgrade ... spend a little more on a logi mouse and it is worth it.,2021,09
"I got sick of using my touchpad and needed an actual mouse for 3D printing software. Trying to rotate and re-size print patterns with a touchpad was a nightmare, but this is a great mouse for the price and has already made my life a lot easier!",2021,09
"Really slick aerodynamic mouse, fits in your hand perfectly.  Love the different blinking colors. Also comes with rechargeable batteries all you have to do plug into available slot on your computer and you are ready to go.  Highly recommend !!!!",2021,09
"The mouse was very easy to setup.  Had instructions on charging, on the mouse itself, would definitely recommend, great on the price as well.",2021,09
"Definitely has a sleek feel to it and the lights are pretty, had it for a week so far so good 👍",2021,09
It was made of cheaper plastic then I expected and refused to charge after it ran out after the first time.  Wasn't enough money to make it worth my time trying to return it.  The color change was cool was it lasted.,2021,09
I love my mouse it's so cute and works great.,2021,09
"I didn't like the way the light shown thru the top, like the plastic was super thin and semi-transparent and it didn't come thru evenly. I have been using it for a while now and it sometimes gives me trouble. I have to tap the bottom to get the red light back on and the wheel stops working sometimes. Just unplug USB and plug back in fixes it. Still 5 stars because at this price it's great!",2021,09
" Works well until it goes into sleep mode.  When you wake it up the cursor is incredibly laggy and skips around.  The only way to get that to stop is to turn it off and then back on. Which seems minuscule, but it gets really annoy the longer you use it.Maybe I just got a defective one? It's got some really high marks... but buyer beware.Video shows it being woken up, then I turn it off/on and it works fine.",2021,09
"This is exactly what I was looking for. Streamlined, quiet and rechargeable!",2021,09
The mouse is great. The install was very easy. Just plug it in and it is ready to use. I love the changing lights on the mouse. If anyone wants a LED wireless mouse this is the mouse to purchase.,2021,09
I love how sleek it is and that its very responsive. Stylish and comfortable in my hand. If my wife takes this one (like she does most of my peripherals) then Ill definitely be buying another.,2021,09
Lasted one day!,2022,06
"Literally, only had the mouse for three days and used it on the first day and now it has stopped working ! It doesn’t charge I plug it up and it may charge for 3 minutes then it just stops charging. Then when I go to turn it on it just turns on and instantly turns off. This mouse is literally a piece of crap. Will be getting my money back !!!",2021,09
"Very nice for the price. I usually use it for about 5 hours at a time and the battery holds. I have put about 80 hours on it and it's still working fine. It is simple, light, relatively comfortable, and it looks sharp.",2021,09
This product is very good and nice to hold and use. I will recommend this mouse to everybody.,2021,09
It's beautiful and sleek!,2021,09
"Was so excited to get this, it stopped working after one month. changed the battery but no go. I bought it to relieve my carpal tunnel pain and that was great but it just stopped working.",2021,09
only owned it for 2 weeks and  all i want to  di is throw it in the trash it freezes all the  time and it  goes dead every  2 hours,2021,09
Remember to recharge it--something I neglected to do because I am an idiot :),2021,09
I use it for gaming. I have no problem with it.,2021,09
"Cheaply made, mine broke already, barely used and it came apart and I can't snap it back together.  Short charge life though it is convenient to have a charge vs. battery.",2021,09
"I LOVE this mouse!! It fit & feels great in my hand- I’m on the computer a lot, so that is important to me. I LOVE the colors!! As you can tell by my mouse pad- I love colors. It’s easy and fast to wake.  It’s great- I don’t have a negative thing to say.",2021,09
"The mouse didn't track well and kept freezing, and then my laptop shut down within 10 seconds of plugging the adapter in. I would avoid this one.",2021,09
Needed a wireless mouse for a work laptop and this mouse gets the job done. The price is very affordable and the product came very fast. Was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the clicking sound- that should come in handy during the early mornings work days. Would recommend this mouse if anyone is trying to find something for their Macbook (USB C port).,2021,09
Long battery life. The lights are beautiful and you can change them. The mouse is sleek and gets the job done.,2021,09
"Perfect mouse for my laptop. Thin and easily stored, it tracks great and fits into my hands very comfortably. Sleep mode prevents battery drainage if I forget to turn it off after use. Highly recommend.",2021,09
The USB port broke inside my work laptop after only using this wireless mouse for 2 days. There was nothing that happened that would have/should have caused the usb to break other than it being poorly made. I’m am very disappointed with the outcome.,2021,09
" I liked the product while it lasted the few months it did, it just stopped working out the blue.",2021,09
I use it for work charged it and it last weeks . Easy to use and doesn’t jump around,2021,09
"I don't do much PC gaming at the moment so I can't speak for that. But this is a great buy. Very affordable, small but great for my big long hands, great response time, long lasting battery charge, and easy to see in the dark.",2021,09
Good quality mouse. Very easy to pair and it feels nice in your hand. I like the Led touch,2021,09
"I wanted to find a slim, wireless mouse similar to a Mac's magic mouse, without the high price tag. While this certainly *isn't* a magic mouse, it's a pretty good substitute for a fraction of the cost. There are some tradeoffs of course, due to the slim nature of this mouse - it is extremely lightweight (i.e. not built like a tank) and sometimes the buttons require a sturdy click to ensure a response. But, all in all, I'm happy with my purchase. It looks nice, works well and it has gone about 2 months so far without needing a recharge. Speaking of which...I leave the mouse on all the time and it goes into sleep mode. No big deal, just realize you need to click a button to wake it up once you power on your laptop or desktop. Otherwise, it will seem like the mouse isn't working. Also, I've had a couple of instances where I had to reinsert the USB adapter to get it to reconnect. But, that was maybe 2 times in the past couple of months.In short, I recommend this product. The company provided great support when I received the wrong color mouse and they've been top-notch to deal with. They stand behind their product.",2021,09
This product already fell apart! It’s very lightly used and the mouse is broken already!,2021,09
Right out the box I noticed the very plastic/cheap feel. The RBG lights are bright but I honestly bought it for a cheap mouse. After using it for a while the wrist did start hurting a little. The worse part is after it died for the first time I did a full charge and it has not worked since. I'm sure I can go through the warranty but I'll just take the loss. You get what you paid for.,2021,09
"I really enjoyed this mouse at 1st due to my job, but less than 4 months of using it it has completely stopped working. One of the girls I work with owns a similar mouse, and when mine stopped working it actually worked with her laptop even though the mouse chip was plugged into my laptop.",2021,09
We use it for our home pc works great. Would recommend,2021,09
Mouse no longer will charge or hold charge. Even after attempting to charge for 2 nights. Waste of my money.,2021,09
Works great,2021,09
Absolute crap. The item doesn’t hold a charge and after a month it broke. Won’t even charge. Also way too small,2021,09
"It was important for me to have a mouse that not only I could see in the dark, but something that was quiet. I also enjoy the fact that this mouse is rechargeable, so this mouse will last me for the long run. The light up feature is a huge plus - something I didn't know I would appreciate since I tend to work on my laptop in the dark. Great quality overall!",2021,09
I bought this mouse just over a month ago and it has already stopped working. Awful product and a waste of money!!,2021,09
Mouse doesn't connect to computer even when fully-charged and has USB plugged in. Am unable to even get a refund.,2021,09
"This is a realy bad mouse, iv used it for about 2 weeks now and the sensor only picks up half of my movements, the rgb is basally non existent and the feel of this mouse is realy crapy. It seems i can just break it with 1 hand. the batterie life is also terrible. If it could not get worse then this the company actually buys the reviews by sending you money via PayPal, so don't let the reviews make your decision",2021,09
"This is by far my favorite mouse! I can wake up my computer by tapping the button on the mouse. I goes to sleep saving me a bit in new batteries. If I didn't notice the mouse sliding off the laptop and onto the chair laser up, I would be changing the batteries frequently. This one recharges! No batteries to buy!",2021,09
I like that the mouse is slim. I also like the lights and how smooth it is. The sleep mode works fine. I use the mouse for work. I am happy with the rechargeable functionality and I find I don’t need to recharge daily. So far I have recharged every few days and I don’t know how long the change will last but at least 4 days for daily work use. It is a good value in my opinion.,2021,09
"Mouse never worked with usb c adapter. Flashes once red and never connects. Clearly cheap construction and plastic. Not even sure it charges properly, glows blue briefly and then turns back off.",2021,09
The mouse is comfortable. It's easy to click. It doesn't get stuck or it isn't too loose or too hard. The mouse itself is good size for my hands! The colors are very vibrant and pretty! They are soothing to see. Thank you for the complimentary mouse pad. It was thoughtful!,2021,09
"Rechargeable, beautiful features, long lasting hours for use. On/off switch.",2021,09
I use this product for Mac book air and it works great.,2021,09
"The mouse performs just like it states. Perfect design, smooth scrolling, and a quality product!",2021,09
"Super comfy and cool, but I get disconnected easily.",2021,09
"This little wireless mouse is awesome. The color at night looks amazing. Love the handle, my wife liked it as well that I had to buy her one as well. Thanks for the amazing product",2021,09
"slim profile, love that it doesn't need battries. colorful.",2021,09
"I really liked this mouse, being able to charge it and not worry about batteries, was working great up till today.  I tried to pull the wireless usb from the chromebook and it only partially came out.  The cover to it was still stuck inside the port.  I had to use tools to get it out and now it’s no longer usable.  Very upset, I have a lot of work I have to get done and using a mouse makes it smoother to navigate. Guess this would happen just after 2 weeks of the return window closing.  I have only had this since the end of July 2021.",2021,09
"This mouse is so hard to use that I’m scrolling my documents with the keyboard arrow keys. Push the left button 10 times, it might place the cursor, select the word or do nothing, depends on the mouse gods. If you leave the mouse arrow over the cursor when you FINALLY get it where you want and if you type, nothing happens.This thing is trash. Buying a Logitech mouse to replace.",2021,09
The mouse is fine but the scroll button started squeaking almost immediately and is pretty annoying.,2021,09
Mouse was just OK. The USB C adapter didn’t work at all. Junk parts.,2021,09
The mouse is fine for typical home use but the dongle drives me crazy. I remove it from my laptop when it's not in use and put it back under the mouse. Its pretty difficult to remove it again without some kind of sharp edge. I feel like it will eventually break.,2021,09
Battery holds for several days after one charge....probably almost two weeks or more.Lighting is beautiful and can be adjusted.Very responsive.,2021,09
"There is so much to say about this.  I bought this for my mom and she loves it.  It has a nice design, nice feel to it and works beautifully.  Well worth the money spent.  Thumbs up.",2021,09
"This mouse was disappointing. It would work for a while and then it would lose connection and stop working. I thought at first it was losing traction and wasn’t sensing movement. So, I bought an entirely new mousepad. Did the same thing. After a few minutes of use, it would lose connection.",2021,09
Works well as described. Slim and easy to use. Even came with dongle for USB-C if your computer has it. lights can be turned on and off.,2021,09
Love the sleek style and easy to glide use of the mouse. Love the colors as well,2021,09
"I bought mine in Mint Green! It's almost effortlessly easy to set up. The battery is lasting beautifully.  I absoulutely love it soooo much, I just ordered my daughter one, in the dark gray. She's going to love the LED lights. THANK YOU!!!",2021,09
I was looked forward to having this mouse but I used about twice since I got and it's not working already. I don't know if it's defective or what. I guess there go my $13...,2021,09
Set up couldn't be easier.  I put the white USB thing into my computer and the mouse magically worked.  That's all it took!  I got the gold rose and it's very pretty.,2021,09
Would love it if it held a charge or had a backup space for a battery. I have to constantly charge this usually every two days in the middle of my work day. Im over it going to go back to a battery mouse.,2021,09
"The mouse drags, after I use for like an hour, battery does not last too long, it takes longer to charge then the amount of time been use. Will not buy. Look for better quality name brand. I do not recomend at all. I wish I can get my money back",2021,09
Mouse goes dormant after 20-30 seconds and is Extremely glitchy until you turn it off and back on and then it works OK until you stop using it again. Zero out of five would never buy again,2021,09
"The USB-C receiver was missing upon opening, which was the main reason I got this mouse! I tried using it with another laptop and after fully charging it, it would not work!! After charging for hours and hours again, it still would not work! Very disappointed.",2021,09
"I like that it is lightweight and very durable. And it is quiet, I can use it at night or early morning and not make a sound.",2021,09
"As soon as it ran out of charge, the mouse died permanently. I tried charging it for hours in the hopes that a full charge would cause it to work again, but it didn’t. I would not recommend this mouse.",2021,08
This mouse was fine for a year but now it barely works so now i have to replace it,2021,08
"Got it because it matched my new rainbow keyboard, but it was very disappointing. Mouse chose when and where to work causing my cursor to jump all over the screen and not respond",2021,08
"I ordered it on June 14, 2021 and at the end of August the dongle broke off of my USB. There is still a metal piece stuck in the usb.",2021,08
Love this mouse. It's sleek and quiet. No loud clicking noise. Glides seamlessly. I will be back for another for my wife! Thank you.,2021,08
It broke after 4 weeks.,2021,08
Wish I hadn't missed the return window on this one. This mouse does not have a range of 10 meters as stated. It has difficulty tracking at just 1 meter (or even a couple of feet) away. This was supposed to replace a mouse from another seller that I also had trouble with. It turned out to be the same exact mouse. It's disheartening to find out that multiple companies are selling the same useless products. I would recommend spending a little more money on a mouse from a reputable brand.,2021,08
Just stopped working after 2 weeks,2021,08
"I loved this product for a couple of weeks, but after is ran out of juice the FIRST time and I charged it overnight, it hasn't worked again.  I CANNOT recommend this product.  And I love to give a 5 rating.  Wanted to just exchange it, but no option for that! Guess I had it too long.  But it is fun and beautiful!!!",2021,08
"Loved the look and feel of this mouse, but after only 4 weeks of school, the USB completely came apart when I pulled it out of my son's Chromebook. There was no impact or anything to cause this, and the kiddo was quite upset that it broke because he loves the look of this mouse as well as how it feels in his hand.",2021,08
It quit working after less than 2 months. Ugh!  It’s no wonder they only have a 30 day return policy.,2021,08
"I have been using the wireless mouse for 3 weeks.  I waited to write the review so I could truly review it based on my experience. It has not disappointed me, and I like everything about it.  I charge it whenever I remember to. The design is sleek, and the changing colors are soothing. When I take my eyes off the screen, I stare at the mouse. The respond to clicks is smooth, and quick. I can feel the clicks but not hear the clicks.",2021,08
Not bad. As expected for the price. Clicks a little loud when you click use it.,2021,08
Not attractive when lit up — because the light leaks through the white shell. Just not attractive,2021,08
"I purchased this mouse because it matched my laptop and seemed like it would look really attractive and cool when I was using it.It looked exactly like the mouse in the picture, and was easy to charge and use. It also held a charge for a long time which I was really happy about.The reason my review is so low is because my mouse only lasted for 2 months and then it completely stopped working no matter what I did. I certainly wasn't expecting a wireless mouse to last forever but it would have been nice to get at least 6 months out of it before it died.If you're looking for something cute and short-term and don't mind having to buy several mice every year this is the perfect purchase for you.",2021,08
This mouse made my life easier honestly!!!!!,2021,08
"Upon unpackaging the item, everything was as advertised and instructions were simple and easy to follow.  However, after a coupe of uses the battery was no longer holding a charge.  The light would turn on indicating that it was charging and a couple of minutes later, the light was off.  I told myself that maybe the mouse was charging even though the light was not on so I left it on to charge for a couple of hours.  Unfortunately, the mouse was not charging as it was already dead after five minutes of use.  I found myself using my laptop mouse more often then this mouse due to this.  Ergonomic design and lighting is great, but kind of useless given that the mouse did not fulfill its main purpose - 1 star.",2021,08
"Very disappointed in this product.  The item arrived obviously used and it did not work.  Overall, it was a very negative experience.  Would not recommend.",2021,08
"So it has problems, the biggest one was the move the cursor on it's own. Like it just spazzes out. I could work with it, didn't mind it all that much besides it being a REAL annoyance when gaming. Then it got more frequent and then the roller that scrolls broke and I only had it for a week or two. SO now I got to replace it. Not a great product. Looks nice but made cheap which I suppose is why it is.",2021,08
"I was looking for a replacement mouse, as my old mouse stopped working properly. When I ordered this, I first received a mouse that did not work properly. It went into sleep mode every few seconds, requiring me to switch it off and back on in order to work again for a few seconds. I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement, which works perfectly.",2021,08
"Light weight, ergonomic. Bought on 06/23/21. Died on 09/05/21. Impossible to recharge",2021,08
Bought for laptop - just poor performance of mouse.,2021,08
"The USB plug broke after one use. I plugged it into my chromebook's USB port and when I went to remove it, the metal stayed in the laptop. SUPER disappointed, I was so happy with it up until that point. Cheaply made, unfortunately. The mouse itself was cute, colors were nice, but when it's wireless the USB plug HAS to be good quality or it's useless.",2021,08
Never could get it to work.  Cannot adequately review it.,2021,08
I loved the changing colors and the ease of use. I love the slim look and feel while using it.,2021,08
Bought this item and worked only for a few weeks. I wanted to return it but wasn't able to do so in the time frame because I got hit with COVID. I was too sick to return this item and wish we could get our money back because the item doesn't even work. Worked for a few weeks and no longer will charge.,2021,08
I don’t know if there is a compatibility issue but it just doesn’t work most of the time. I try to click on things and there is no response. I don’t recommend it at all.,2021,08
"Wish the battery lasted longer. I seem to have to recharge it every month vs rechargeable batteries last me 6 months before I need to recharge. Otherwise, nice ergonomic shape and low enough to not affect the wrist. The optical sensor is not so great especially when battery is low.",2021,08
"Worked until it needed to be charged. After charging, it worked sporadically, and needed to be charged everyday. I need to be able to use my mouse everyday , not wait for it to be charged.",2021,08
Don’t bother even thinking about purchasing this item. It’s terrible. Does not connect to anything. Very cheap looking. The color doesn’t match the description. The seller is a little suspicious too. Tried giving me a refund with a fake Amazon gift card.,2021,08
"Likes: No noise click, lights look cool, chargeableDislikes:1. Chargeable battery life is very short. I had to turn off every time I don’t use it or else battery runs out super fast within 1-2 days!2. After 2 months the charging outlet is broken. There’s no way to fix it. Now I can’t use it anymore! Safer to go back to traditional battery mouse which lasts for a long time.",2021,08
"Awesome mouse, got it in 2 days and was very pleased with how this mouse performs!",2021,08
"After less than 2 months, not only will it not hold a charge, doesn't even work plugged into the laptop.Don't buy!!!!!",2021,08
"I got this because our child sleeps while i work. the mouse is super quiet!Pro:- quiet lef/right buttons- adjustable sensitivity- micro usb is easy to charge and doesn't interfere with mouse use- color changes- usb doesn't disconnectcons:- middle button ""click"" is louder- color can't be set. it rotates. it'd be cool if i could lock it in.for this price, it's a pretty good purchase.",2021,08
"It's a nice mouse, however they sent me the wrong color, I wanted black... not pink",2021,08
"There's something wrong with this mouse and I see I'm not alone. If I leave it alone for like 5 minutes, it stops working and can't be woken back up. I've tried powering it on and off, unplugging the usb, charging... the dang thing just decided not to work any more. Returning.",2021,08
Works as intended. The lights are pretty but a bit bright. I use it from across the room with no issues and the battery life has been excellent even with me forgetting to turn it off.,2021,08
"This is a really nice mouse, I like it and it works well. The only thing is you charge it with a mini USB charger and it takes a long time. Not sure if I'm not charging it all the way, but it has a short battery life.",2021,08
Doesn't stay charged,2021,08
I love this mouse cause it has really cool lights and I really like that it’s petite and lightweight.,2021,08
"Do not buy. Weak, flimsy crap",2021,08
"Use traveling with laptop compact and thin, better than standard mini mouse",2021,08
This product broke in 3 days,2021,08
Stopped working within a month. Won’t charge. Light comes on and goes right out. I bought 2. I plan on sending the other one back. Still in the box.,2021,08
"I used for 20-25 mins and it stopped working. The lights were ON, my PC detected the dongle, but mouse didn't work. Initiated the return",2021,08
" I really was waiting for use this mouse and everything OK.Great pink golden color, amazing that is rechargeable and super ergonomic for edit my videos.",2021,08
Awful,2021,08
I just bought this article about 3-4 weeks ago and at the beginning it was working just fine but it started acting up really bad since last week!!,2021,08
"UPDATE:Received a response from the seller and they are sending me a new mouse. Super quick response time, so updated my rating!Super cute and fun that it lights up, but doesn’t last. Only have had this 2 months and the scroll broke.",2021,08
It’s ok. But getting the dongle out was quite the challenge. Not the greatest design on that part.,2021,08
"this mouse works for 5 mins or less at a time then has to be powered off and on, it starts lagging. I charged it all night so its not a battery issue. and it only works when its all lit up not in the 1 mode",2021,08
Worked fine for a month. Now it doesn't hold a charge and if I wanted it to work i'd need to tape the charger into a very specific spot. cheaply made piece of crap,2021,08
"Worked great for a few days, but then it quit working. It wouldn’t charge, and if I got the light to actually come on, the cursor wouldn’t move.",2021,08
The mouse worked great for just over a month - then the charging port detached from the mouse - yes- came right out. I no longer have the ability to charge it….This was PROBABLY a glitch with my individual unit ….Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.,2021,08
Center wheel was hard to roll after a couple of days. A few days later the whole thing failed.  I like the rechargeable feature but battery does not last long,2021,08
The charge port messed up not even a month later. Super disappointed,2021,08
"This cable is SO SHORT, when you plug it into ANY of the computers USB ports the mouse is suspended in mid-air.  AVOID (by the way, it doesn't take batteries)",2021,08
"Very nice, sleek, little mouse. Its not the color I ordered. I really don't like rose gold, but the price is great, its otherwise everything I wanted, and is a good product. Does what its supposed to do. I just wish it was black, lol. (BTW, I checked. I did order black.)",2021,08
I purchased this mouse for my daugyer and I live that she loves it! I had wireless before but nothing compared to this one. Easy set up too! I would definitely recommend this mouse.,2021,08
"I liked it a lot at first, worked great. But after one week, it's not working properly. It sort of works, but is not smooth like it was at first - something I'd expect after at least a few months of having a cheap mouse. Sadly I got rid of the original box, so I cannot return it. I hope I can still get a refund!",2021,08
Mouse completely died and wouldn't charge in less than a month-no return policy,2021,08
Good material,2021,08
Worked well but dropped it off my desk on accident and it broke and no longer works.,2021,08
Pathetic,2021,08
"The battery of this mouse works well. I haven't timed it but I have left it on overnight and it stills has battery. I'm not a gamer but I imagine the gaming quality will be affected depending on how strong the bluetooth connection of the mouse is to the a PC setup. I recently switched from a laptop that had the standard rectangular port (USB-A) to one that needed the adapter (USB-C). The adapter that comes with the  mouse worked for about a minute before it stop functioning. So I brought out my own adapter (from a different device) and the mouse now works. I also tested both adapters with a wired mouse. It suffices to say that it was the mouse's adapter that is not working. I could have gotten a faulty one, so the problem could be exclusive to me.TL;DR - Mouse adapter didn't work. Ur screwed if urs doesn't work either and don't have an extra one.",2021,08
Charged it for hours and hours and could never pair with my Mac. I used the adaptor that was included and tried multiple times but I was never able to use it. Definitely not easy to pair as it’s advertised.,2021,08
"Maybe just unlucky given the reviews. But they mouse won't hold a charge. Simply doesn't work. Also the connectors are flush with each other, feels cheap.",2021,08
"I am not very hard on this mouse - I use it to work from home; but this morning after only using for 3 months the wheel of the mouse broke. Not sure what happened as I am very gentle on the mouse. It's a nice design and I love the lights and the fact that it's rechargeable, but it is pretty cheap and can break easily so keep that in mind when purchasing.",2021,08
"Light weight, fits hand perfectly",2021,08
Works well and charges very quickly,2021,08
"Ordered this mouse in mid-May. In June, it started acting a bit off and I could only use it turned on to one certain position. Yesterday (August 30th) the roller ball on top stopped working and now I can't scroll screens without using the sidebar. Very disappointed in how quickly this mouse stopped working. My grandmother always said you get what you pay for...and in this instance, she was 100% correct.",2021,08
" I was actually about to return the mouse Bc it stopped working and I couldn’t  find where to replace the batteries.  Had thrown out the box and prob the instruction booklet (can’t remember if it actually came with instruction booklet).  Went to Amazon and read the product detail and saw that it’s a rechargeable mouse, using a USB cable.Like: it’s small, lightweight, and comfortable.  It fit perfectly in my hand and when resting on top of the mouse, the mouse didn’t feel bulky or heavy.Like: the colors changing - pretty coolLike:  not battery operated.  You can charge using a standard USB cable.Like and Dislike:  I read that there is a silent option to mute click sound - have not found it to test - but like that there is the option to take the mouse silent.  After trying to research how to make the mouse silent, I have still not been able to do so.Like (maybe)  great that there is a sleep mode- not sure where to find it or if I have, really cannot tell the difference.  The options in the back are OFF, ON, and something that looks like a SUN.  When on the “ON”option, I think (I think it’s in sleep mode Bc the light turns red and then turn off) but when on the “SUN”mode, the lights change.Dislike:  When using the mouse, at first, there are no issues.  This is the same experience if the mouse is used with USB cable or wireless.  Randomly, the mouse will then lag and get stuck.  Needed to turn power on and off a few times.Aside from the minor issue of latency and turning the mouse on and off, it’s ok.  I got this mouse as a second mouse Bc the original mouse I purchased was taken by my son.  It is def for the more “casual” user - surfing the internet or checking on EMs.  If trying to use for work, I’d get a mouse a little bit more sturdy and reliable.",2021,08
Comfortable and responsive mouse. Clicking is indeed very quiet. Lights are just as advertised and battery is more than satisfactory. Can use multiple days without charging.,2021,08
"Got this mouse for my desktop setup which I mainly use for office purposes and it has been working great. It replaced a cheaper version than this one that I got at 5 Below of which I did not expect much but got me going for 2 years.I don't think I would recommend for gaming since is a little on the small side and somewhat flat, but who knows, is it very responsive thought and looks nice with the changing colors.",2021,08
"I have touchscreen chromebook but i still need a mouse to use on excel worksheet. This is slim, easy to use and handy. Led lights is a plus.",2021,08
This baby is great! Works perfect with my 2020 MacBook Pro and I love that it’s rechargeable!,2021,08
"Mouse doesn't slide easily, sticks and on both my desk surface and my mouse pad. You have to click very hard to make a selection and the scroll bar is not consistent in speed. Wouldn't purchase this product.",2021,08
I really like the feel and look of this mouse. I don't like that anytime I stop using the mouse for a minute or two that the mouse doesn't react. I end up turning it off and on again to get it working. I'm interrupted frequently while using the mouse so it's not realistic for me to turn the mouse off every time I stop using it.Edit: Today is day 5 of using the mouse while I wait to receive the other mouse I bought. The mouse no longer consistently turns on when I turn it off and on again to stop it from lagging.,2021,08
"I really liked this mouse.  The design is sleek, I can use the little attachment for my Mac to make it compatible and it maneuvered well.  However, after only a few weeks of use the top plastic portion that splits down the middle to accommodate left and right clicking just literally spit apart and now my mouse is not functional.  I'm very disappointed in the quality and durability of this item.  However, I gave it 3 stars for the awesome performance prior to it breaking.",2021,08
"stopped working after the second week.  i charged it overnight every night before i left the office and it was working fine then  it started skipping so i tried to put it on the charger for the day and used another mouse thinking maybe it just didn't charge the night before then when i took it off it wouldn't work at all.  BUT, it does feel great in your hands and the lighting is pretty cool...just wish it would have lasted!",2021,08
NO USB ONLY TYPE C,2021,08
It stopped working after 2 months,2021,08
Great mouse! I got this because my laptop had to many wires sticking out everywhere. This has been great to free up the mess of wires and make my work day easier.,2021,08
"I was a little worried about battery life based on some of the other reviews.  I am not a gamer. I have an office job.  But I'm on my computer probably 12-14 hours a day and used my mouse extensively.  A single charge lasts me 4-5 days.  You can also use the mouse when you are charging.  I have a USB port on my keyboard that I use per my attached picture.  As you can see, the charging cable is pretty short.  So some might need to extend the cord.But overall, I am very happy with this mouse.",2021,08
Just had mouse for 3 months and it has stopped working.,2021,08
"Works well, hooked up immediately, love the feels and the look!",2021,08
Batteries would be SO MUCH easier with the way the power runs out after charging by USB. Frustrating because if your in the middle of something I have to go back to old mouse until this mouse is ready to use. I love the feel of it though and the cool lights.,2021,08
"This was a great mouse for it's price. Loved the colorful lights too! Overall, satisfied with this purchase.",2021,08
Product broke after one month of using.,2021,08
We have been extremely pleased with this mouse. We Have an HP Laptop & it works wonderfully with it.,2021,08
I bought this and after a few months the center stopped working so i cant scroll at all. Also it doesn't click. Terrible product.,2021,08
This is not working,2021,08
"The mouse is sturdy and the rainbow lighting feature is fun. It auto shuts off after 10 minutes (I think) which is great for saving the battery. I thought that having to put it on a charger would be a major inconvenience it's not, at all. The recharge is quick and I only do it once a week, so far.",2021,08
This little mouse works great for my needs. It charges straight away from my laptop and functions as expected. I would buy it again and I recommend it to anyone needing an inexpensive wireless mouse.,2021,08
Very cool lighting as seen in the photos and it's a soft touch mouse... no loud clicks here!,2021,08
I ordered this mouse in April 2021 and it no longer holds a charge.,2021,08
"not sure why, but it kept dying real quick.",2021,08
great mouse I love it,2021,08
I have to charge it every ten minutes of use.  I charge it for hours and still only last ten minutes.  It's really cute but not very functional.,2021,08
great little mouse.  Fits nicely in my hand. You can turn the LED on or off.  Click to wake from sleep.  Quiet clicking.  I like it :),2021,08
👍🎁💕,2021,08
"Purchased this because of it can be recharged with any usb port, no batteries required. It is also compact with a low profile. It will be great for travel because it will take up very little space. Fits easily in a pocket without bulging out.",2021,08
This was a disappointing and irritating order. I am a college student and a full time manager so I work a lot on my laptop. I ordered a mouse for ease of certain tasks that required a right click or highlights. This mouse was unusable directly out of the box. Charged it up and it never held a charge long enough to work. Very disappointing and a waste of time.,2021,08
"The mouse works fine, but i was disappointed that the color did not match my MacBook as it shows.",2021,08
"This mouse has become my new best friend! I have arthritis which has severely affected my hands. Its extremely ergonomic in shape and usage. The mouse is absolutely quiet as promised, plus is easily used without a huge amount of pressure from my fingers, hand, or wrist . The mouse also moves very easily on my mouse pad with no glitches or hesitations. My hands are grateful, and so am I!Another feature is the light additions which means it can be found anywhere in the dark. Also the aqua was an excellent choice in color for me as it does show against many darker colorsOnce charged the battery is good for a quite a few days. I do use the mouse from four to eight hours daily (and sometimes more). I have only had to charge the mouse once in the past week after using continuously for EIGHT days. Actually it was still working but had become a bit slow to react . Rather than wait for it to quit completely I charged it during the night so it was ready in the morning for the next week.I am very glad I chose to try this mouse. My next purchase of a mouse (if or when needed) will be a repeat of this one in a different color.This is an unpaid and unsolicited review from a grateful owner.",2021,08
"it’s a good size weight and shape but it bothers me that you can’t turn the red light off when you move it. if you have the rainbow light on, the red light still goes on when you move it so you don’t really get the rainbow effect",2021,08
"Let's face it, it just a mouse, but kinda fun to have the colors, since my keyboard is colored too!",2021,08
Loved everything about this mouse until the charging jack came loose after three months of use. There is no way to charge it now.  I guess you get what you pay for.,2021,08
This mouse is very comfortable and the colors are super cool. It’s also very economical and works well. Highly recommend!,2021,08
I love this mouse! The colors are beautiful and I've gotten many compliments on it. It feels great to use as well. I took away one star because the charging cord stopping working about a day after using it. Easily charges with any micro USB though. It's been a couple months and still works being used every day at work.,2021,08
"I love this mouse. Its quiet, modern and the lights are a nice added touch. Pro tip: remember to store the usb connector under the mouse when not in use, I have lost mine or damaged it in the past.",2021,08
"Good if you want a wireless mouse that works for 3 months.  Otherwise, buy something else.",2021,08
"This wireless mouse is very light and thin. It can be used for a long time after charging. I didn't read the instruction at all, I just plugged the receiver which is hided at the bottom of itself into the USB port of the markbook air and it began to work normally. It’s quite easy and quick to get start.",2021,08
I love this wireless mouse! It has nice LED lights on it and it lasts for up to 5-7 days without a charge!I definitely recommend this product!,2021,08
Excellent.  My 8 year old  God daughter used it for school She said it was fantastic!,2021,08
Its a great mouse but it stops tracking if I stop using it.. like the ponter starts lagging.,2021,08
"The one I ordered will only turn on if the switch is in a strange position that is between the clicks. I had to move the switch carefully with two fingers until I found the very small area where it turns on. Sending it back because its almost impossible to use, if the switch gets moved it takes a few minutes to turn it back on.",2021,08
"I used this guy for dayssssss upon receiving without charging. A few times I’ve had (thought I had) issues with the mouse but I had it backwards. That’s my main complaint- too easy to put backwards. It doesn’t attract dust and dirt, works on every surface I’ve put it on…..and it’s cute",2021,08
"Got this for a great price, the size is perfect for my hands and is easy setup.",2021,08
The mouse arrived with great packaging and easy to do follow instructions. The feel is very smooth. I like the on off switch which is very sturdy and I think will last for a long time. Charging is simple. Able to store USB adapter on mouse. Best of all the lights are bright and as expected,2021,08
"Loved the mouse and was using it regularly for 4 months. Just recently, the scrolling wheel completely stopped working. All of the other functions work, but the scrolling feature is a must for me.",2021,08
This mouse is on point. Literally. I had never thought of buying one to this slant and Size until the color locked me in. It's an absolute match to my laptop. The setup was quick and easy. I simply turned it on input the USB and was using within seconds. It's very versatile and works with or without a pad. Lightweight and easy to store with the flat shape.,2021,08
This is a second time I've bought this mouse and its broken on me within a few months. It just decides to work only when it wants to.,2021,08
"It worked for a month and a half, now it's glitchy and won't work. Pass this up and buy a quality mouse. Looks pretty with the colors.... Other than that... It was a waste of money.",2021,08
Doesn’t hold charge for even a full day.,2021,08
"I use it in my class. As I move around classroom, I click the mouse to move on with my presentation. Good so far.",2021,08
Needs to be charged all the time.  Not very comfortable to use.,2021,08
Great,2022,03
Only used it 4 times and went to turn it on and won’t power up. Lasted 32 days. 2 days past the return time they gave of 30 days. What a waste of money. Thanks god it wasn’t much. Don’t waste a dollar on it.,2021,08
"I love this mouse! I use it on multiple devices and it uploads fast. I like it how sleep mode would kick in if you haven't used it in a while. However, it is easy to wake up as well. I like it how you can switch between solid red to rainbow colors. Its quite and moves smoothly. Did I mention I love it?",2021,08
Light never turned on. Came dirty,2021,08
"I probably should have known... but the light is either red or it cycles through colors. This is probably cool for gamers or middle school kids. I would rather be able to pick a color, but that is not a feature available. Which - is probably something I should have expected - but I was being hopeful.",2021,08
Really like the feel of the mouse in my hand. Have dropped it numerous times and it keeps working like a charm. So far I am really pleased with it,2021,08
"Bought this LED wireless mouse July 5, 2021 and received it a couple of day later and really loved it!  Well now it's Aug. 24 and as of yesterday it suddenly stopped working correctly.  I don't even use it with the fancy light changes on.  I tried charging it a couple of times and even once over night and it is still not functioning as it should.I noticed that if left still for a few minutes it would sometimes function well, but only for a few seconds and then it would begin to sporadically move the cursor, if at all.  The little laser guide light goes dim and blinks quite fast.  I am thinking that it suddenly cannot hold a charge....?  Oh, I have also tried using it while connected to the charge port, but it does the same.I would have given it a 5 star rating if it continued working properly as I really like it.  However, since the sudden misfunction, I cannot give it more than 2 stars and I must say that I would NOT recommend this mouse anymore.",2021,08
"I love this mouse! it is very lightweight with an attractive look. One of my favorite features is that it is rechargeable. Second, you have the option of selecting one color (default to red) or multiple colors (swap automatically).  The switch is on the bottom portion of the mouse. My favorite feature is the fact that the mouse goes into sleep mode when you turn off your computer. Saved me so many times from having a dead mouse. It can also be charged while in use. Overall I would definitely recommend this mouse to friends and family.",2021,08
"Shipping was fast and I loved the LEDs. But today - after a week - it stopped working. I figured it needed a charge. It;s now been connected to my laptop for over three hours and the blue light has gone off, which is supposed to mean is all charged and ready to go. But when I disconnect it - nothing, Dead. Guess the low price was a giveaway I should have paid more attention to.",2021,08
won't buy againdoesn't lite up as promised,2021,08
Great product for the value,2021,08
"Within 3 minutes of plugging the new ""rechargeable"" mouse into a USB hub charger (thankfully it wasn't plugged into my daughter's brand new laptop she just opened for her birthday) my house started to smell like smoke and I found the charging cable melting to the mouse in the drawer I'd just put them in to pre-charge. If this had happened at night my house would have probably caught fire. DO NOT BUY. FIRE HAZARD 🔥 DANGEROUS",2021,08
"The wired mouse I've been using at work was driving me insane with its loud clicking noises. I love the convenience of this one being wireless, so it's easy to use with my desktop or laptop. It's super easy to install, and while the buttons aren't completely silent, they are significantly more quiet than your average mouse. The colorful LEDs are fun, but it's not a feature I'll be using a lot. So far I've had no issues with connectivity or responsiveness at all. I certainly recommend this mouse at this price point.",2021,08
The mouse would be fine except it stopped tracking within 1 month.  Cheaper isn't better,2021,08
You can hardly maneuver the clicker with this mouse. It doesn’t do its main function. The LED is ok … I guess. But what’s the point of a mouse that doesn’t do it’s job!? I guess I have a new flashlight. I’d give 0 stars if I could. Don’t waste your time or money on this!,2021,08
Don't buy this product.  This lasted me about a month and 1 week..just enough time to pass where the window of returning was no longer available. Mouse quit on me while I was taking a final for a test. Perfect timing.,2021,08
I bought this mouse thinking a rechargeable was the way to do. It worked well for about a day.  I tried to recharge it several times but would not hold any charge at all. I've gone back to a battery operated mouse.,2021,08
Feels great nice color looks like it will last a very long time. Charge last along time as well.,2021,08
"The left mouse button is impossible to use. I cannot click and drag. It does not respond to a double click. What a nightmare. I would not recommend this at all. I was very excited for a wireless, no battery mouse. I will be returning this.",2021,08
This product was definitely worth the money. It's equipped with every function desirable for a wireless mouse. Being rechargeable is alot better compared to constantly switching batteries personally. The RGB lights were nice as well.,2021,08
It was working great at first but now it's not working. I've had this mouse for about 1 month.,2021,08
The USB break apart and could no longer use the cordless mouse. Ugh,2021,08
So far so good and looks cool with the led lights!,2021,08
Color is not shiny black. Cheap plastic material,2021,08
Works great,2021,08
This mouse is great!  I love that it is so compact.  Being rechargeable is a plus for me!!  The lights make it fun to use!!,2021,08
I didn’t receive all the accessories 🤬,2022,02
"First time charging this mouse I started smelling a burnt plastic smell in my home. Walked over to where it was charging and noticed the smell was a lot stronger, I reached down to unplug it and the cord was red hot!!! Had I not been in that room it would have started a fire. Not happy!!!",2021,08
This wireless mouse works great and is easy to set up. The led lights gives it a nice look and the click is silent. The battery last a day I haven’t had to change them. Over all a 10/10 mouse,2021,08
"I have tried charging this mouse with the original cables it came with, did not charge. I then tried multiple cables and power sources I already owned, still did not charge. I left it plugged in for 12 hours while I was away from home, I come home to an uncharged mouse. The blue light stays on for about 30 seconds before shutting off. The design and price were what attracted me to choosing this specific mouse, I would recommend spending a bit more on a quality mouse that can serve its purpose.",2021,08
"Worked for 1 day, then.... nothing won't even turn on.",2021,08
Awesome mouse for the price,2021,08
"The mouse works, but after less than 1 week of use by my son, the roller ball no longer works. You can't scroll with it. The rest of it works, for now, but will probably not make it through the school year.",2021,08
"This is a low rise mouse. Very responsive and smooth movement. I would definitely buy one again.Note: I don't play games, so I can't speak to that aspect.",2021,08
It broke the same day,2021,08
I have been using this mouse for a couple of weeks now.  I love the rechargeable feature and the battery seems to last a long time (never turn it off).  Highly recommend this one!!!,2021,08
Item broke already. The wheel in the middle does not work. Did not last 2 months,2021,08
"great range. finally we found a wireless mouse that works well. we use this for television viewing. we have our laptop attached to our television. we are a good 4-6 feet away from our television and laptop when we use this mouse. again, it has great range. easy to use and works quickly. highly recommended.",2021,08
"I just got the item and to be honest I didn’t expect much from it in the first place but reading reviews I thought it was relatively good. The clicking tends to stick w mine and I tried doing a CPS (Clicks per second test) and out of the 20 time I clicked, the test only registered 9. I can say it wasn’t the tests fault since I have to triple click most things in order to pretty much do anything. For everyday work I won’t say I recommend it but it’s enough for that but for gaming I do not recommend this since 90% of your clicks won’t work because the mouse itself isn’t that great quality.",2021,08
It worked great while it worked but after less then three months my mouse has stopped working. It turns on and lights up but will no connect to the usb wirelessly any more. I won’t buy again and wouldn’t recommend if you’re looking for something to last.,2021,08
"If you're looking for a wireless mouse, keep looking! This is not it! The first one I received didn't charge. So, they sent me another one which I started using at the beginning of July, and now it doesn't work anymore. Didn't even last 2 months with normal usage, no gaming or anything. Such a shame, because I actually liked it.",2021,08
"I purchased this mouse for my laptop due to the ease of having a mouse verse a mouse pad. This mouse is very easy to use, rechargeable, and the lights makes it easy to find.",2021,08
"When item was plugged in, it almost immediately melted the charging cable. Thankful that I was close by and smelled the burning smell to unplug it before worse happened.",2021,08
Stopped working after 4 months,2021,08
It only worked one day. Never would connect after that.,2021,08
 It is a nice mouse but it is not changing colors it only shows red,2021,08
"This is such a great mouse! It works so well and I love the pretty colors. It also doesn’t make any noise while clicking, which was my #1 priority. I would definitely recommend this.",2021,08
Purchased on june 28.  I never charge over night.  I  only charge mouse when needed  and turn off after each use however month and a half later mouse is no longer charging.  Very short life span.,2021,08
Pretty lights but when it sleeps you have to turn it off and wait ten seconds and turn it back on.  Stopped working completely less than a month after buying so now its a light up paper weight,2021,08
Does it’s job. Looks pretty and is rechargeable,2021,08
This mouse saves a ton in cost of batteries because it is rechargeable. It fits the palm of my hand very comfortably. Well worth the cost.,2021,08
Easy to use and easy to connect. Workes great with my laptop.,2021,08
The mouse never turned on :(  Complete waste of money - NOT HAPPY,2021,08
"Looked cool, but it broke within the first couple hours of use. Too late to return it, so I guess I have to just eat my investment.",2021,08
Do not buy this complete junk too small,2021,08
"Loved this mouse at first. I had zero problems with it. However, now it will not stay on. It has charged over night but as soon as I take it off the charger to use it, it dies. It will not turn on and I am not able to use it. I guess you get what you pay for.",2021,08
"It was quiet, slim, and responsive…for a month.  Then, the casing began pulling apart and the rolling cursor stopped responding.  Too bad it was such a short-lived product!",2021,08
"Full charge lasts two hours or less. If you want to use it all day, you have to charge it three to five times and of course can't use it while it's charging. I'm buying a different wireless mouse today.",2021,08
"As advertised. Love that you can’t really hear the clicks. Charge it once a week and use it approx. 40 to 45 hrs a week, on color changing setting. Easy set up. Would buy again. Only thing I don’t like is the short charging cable which is a personal preference. You would need a usb plug right next to the mouse if you still need to use it while it’s charging.",2021,08
"This was for my son for school work and he loved the features and the fact that it has lights to make it fancy. It seems pretty smooth without making clicking noise and compact, pretty good alternative for expensive mouses from branded ones",2021,08
"Nice mouse, but would not charge after single use. Tried with the usb on the computer, other usb chargers, even switched their cord out…",2021,08
I bought it in April and by August it would no longer charge.,2021,08
"The mouse never worked, I am very disappointed.",2021,08
"Got this product June 28, 2021. It is August 18th and it no longer functions even when fully charged.  Lasts less than 60 days. It’s beautiful but will end up being a waste of money.",2021,08
Stopped working after a week…,2021,08
I love how this mouse looked and it didn't hurt my hands. Unfortunately I  was able to only charge it 2x and now it won't recharge at all.,2021,08
"Nice little mouse, have gotten compliments on it, functions as expected.",2021,08
"I thought this mouse was very cute. I love the led feature, and I used it to play games with friends (Val, league, genshin, etc) and it is passable for someone who plays casually like me but probably not for someone picky about equipment.However, today it spent some time in the side pocket of my backpack and no longer seems to work :( I turn it on and the light flashes and goes off again, and there is no way to take it apart or try to fix it. If you transport your laptop/pc a lot I would hesitate to get this mouse, but otherwise I was a fan.",2021,08
Solid battery life and great aesthetic. Worth every penny.,2021,08
"I was initially in love with this mouse however soon after while scrolling, the mouse stopped scrolling. You don’t realize how something so small you really see crucial everything works. For the scroll to just stop, I literally want to throw the whole mouse out and probably will. I decided to hold on to it cause it’s just so cute and matches my laptop, however soon after the sensor and clicker stopped working as well.Now I’m forced to get a new mouse.",2021,08
i like the silent clicking and the smoothness and the ergonomic design but the wheel doesn’t scroll anything on the computer. the wheel will move but won’t scroll anything on the screen.,2021,08
"I use this mouse for basic tasks, no gaming, but I like the fact that is rechargeable and seems to hold the charge long enough. I also like the silent mode so I can work at night on bed without disturbing my wife.",2021,08
This mouse works well and is small and quiet.,2021,08
So far so great! No loud clicks and feels good in hand.,2021,08
easy to use,2021,08
SLICK  beautiful mouse for all apps. love that led display on the mouse,2021,08
"The item is easy to work with , but I honestly got it because I liked the LED light feature. However, the mouse does not light up.",2021,08
"I purchased this wireless mouse because I needed one and a cheap one, I was very impressed, you don’t even need to use mousepad, it works smoothly by itself!!",2021,08
"This came on time, exactly as described. It is quieter when you click the buttons than a regular mouse. It's easy to charge and works well. It's wireless which is great! It works perfectly with my sons laptop, and the games he plays on it. I have no complaints. Would recommend to anyone!",2021,08
I purchased this for my mom and once the battery went dead it would not recharge.,2021,08
Works well.,2021,08
This mouse is smooth to use and feels great in my hand. I recommend it.,2021,08
"The mouse is nicely shaped and feels nice in your hand. The clicking is quiet. The only problem is that it does not stay charged more than one day so I have to keep it plugged in, which defeats the purpose of having a wireless mouse.",2021,08
Mouse is very lagging even after full charge.,2021,08
"NOBODY ORDER THIS PIECE OF CRAP, ITS TRASH I CANT EVEN FORTNITE CAUSE ITS TOO FREAKING TWITCHY",2021,08
"I was really looking forward to having a wireless mouse that's rechargeable, but since it has to be recharged every day I just use it with the wire attached. Very disappointing.",2021,08
"Worked when I first charged it, once the charge ran down it wouldn’t charge again.",2021,08
"It seemed to work ok for a couple of days and then I started noticing that it wasn't moving my cursor where I wanted it to go.  Sometimes I'd have to move it real fast just to find the cursor.  No matter what I did, it took an extraordinary amount of time to get it to land in the right spot.  I gave up and started using my old mouse again.",2021,08
Exactly what I wanted and expected.  Love the colors!,2021,08
"like design not function ,,, frustrating",2022,10
This is a great wireless mouse at a great price. It comes with a USB charger and quickly connected to my laptop. It feels great on my palm and the cursor moves around the screen smoothly. I love the ability to change the mouse lighting and love how lightweight but durable it is.,2021,08
"This mouse is cute and comfortable to use but the only downfall is if it is sitting idle for a few minutes, it’s hard to get it working again.  Sometimes I have to turn it off then on",2021,08
"I have had this mouse for a month and other than I like the colors, it is worthless.  I have tried every kind of surface and mouse pad and the performance is very erratic.  I tried recharging and it is no better and today, it just died in the middle of a Zoom meeting I was hosting.  I am flushing it and making a note to never purchase this brand again.",2021,08
Bought 3 of these....the lights are fun and fit really well in smaller hands. BUT these 3 Christmas gifts are no longer usable...durability stinks. My opinion? Would not buy.,2021,08
When I got this mouse I noticed a rattling sound. When it was plugged up i saw that there was a piece broken and rattling around on the inside. The lights don’t look good at all. I returned it.,2021,08
I have charged this mouse ONCE since I received it! I use it EVERY day! It’s been over a month now and no signs of low battery yet. Crazy!,2021,08
IT IS GREAT,2021,08
Nice feel and touch. Fits the hands properly. Hopefully there will be a type C upgrade to these things,2021,08
"Had the mouse charging all weekend via my Desktop PC.  Within an hour and a half this of working, the darn thing stopped working.  I don't know if it went into ""sleep mode"" or not, but I could not get it to work at all.  Leading me to believe it lost its charge.  Therefore I had to plug it back in to charge.  Seriously considering returning it.  I will give it one to two more days to see if it stays charged longer than a few hours.  If it does not, I will be returning it for a full refund.",2021,08
"Although this mouse is nice and worked well for work, it is not meant for extensive use. After exactly one month, this mouse no longer works. In addition, this coincides with the return window closing literally yesterday.",2021,08
Junk! Would not charge after 21 days of use. Sticking to battery operated!,2021,08
Upon receiving the mouse I charged it with the charging cable. Used it for a considerable amount of time and plugged it in. Upon plugging it in there was a an odd smell. The smell was the cable starting to melt!!! I unplugged it and will not be using it again. I’m lucky that I didn’t walk away or my place could have caught on fire!! What a disappointment.,2021,08
Works great and my students love the color changing lights. I bought it for my second computer and it has been so helpful. I would suggest purchasing for yourself ! It has a very smooth texture and slim design always you to take it anywhere. It charged quickly so that I could use it immediately.,2021,08
Using this for my work laptop. Receieved afternoon Friday and used for a little bit and pleased. Put up laptop for the weekend. Went to use it today (Monday) and non responsive. Tried everything and still not working. This thing is junk...,2021,08
This item has already stopped working. It was purchased in May,2021,08
It's pink and super light love it a ton,2021,08
The item was sent without all the items in the box,2021,08
Only holds a charge for 15 minutes :(,2021,08
The technology is great..but ergonomic it is not,2021,08
I use it with my chromebook,2021,08
"Don't get me wrong, I do like this mouse. It's smooth, pretty, easy to use, and overall pretty great. BUT and this is a strong but, if you so much as bump the usb plug in ever so lightly, all use the the mouse ceases and you have to re set it up. I usually use my computer on the couch with my kids next to me and sometimes they bump it, or my dog, or even me. It could be super light, and it still will make me unplug it and re do it over. It's really annoying.",2021,08
Amazing tool for my job that required lot of documentation .,2021,08
Mouse is too small for my hands,2021,08
Made very cheap.  Broke the second it was too late to return it.  I guess I got what I paid for.  Save your money and buy a better quality mouse.,2021,08
"Not a great item for long term use, could be more sturdy.",2021,08
Only last 7 months before it quit working,2021,08
"The style was perfect. However, the mouse stopped working within the first week. I tried to charge it but it simply stopped working. It was a waste of money.",2021,08
Both worked for a month. Both are having issues now. One won’t charge. The other is having connection issues,2021,08
I used the mouse after I got it for 2 hours and within the first 30 minutes the light srop changing colors. It is now only red.,2021,08
"The mouse feels great in your hand, is delightfully colorful but doesn't scroll down the page. I was only able to click down which is bothersome on web pages.I would return it but I threw out the box.If you don't get a defective one, its a good buy for the price.",2021,07
Stopped working within 1 week,2021,07
Not work good 😕,2021,07
Great product!! Mouse is exactly as advertised on the site. Highly recommended!!!,2021,07
"I was searching for a wireless mouse on Amazon and for the price, this was a no-brainer. I received this mouse in the mail in small compact packaging, very simple and easy to get it going. The charging cable that it comes with charged the mouse in about 2 hours, once I plugged it in the mouse lit up blue and turned off once it was fully charged. I purchased the Gray to match my laptop, looks good and not as shiny as I thought it would be which is great. Very comfortable with it in my hand and I have pretty big hands, really receptive to the movement when scrolling. The lights feature is cool if you want to have something different. The silent mouse clicking is a great feature as well if you ever have to do work in a quiet space you will not hear the loud clicking noise coming from this mouse. Very satisfied with this purchase so far.",2021,08
Love this mouse. Great for everyday use. Moves around smoothly and is very quite!,2021,08
"The mouse quality is poor, type C adapter doesn’t work, can’t work for Macbook, but USB adapter works.",2021,08
"Needs better battery life, but overall good wireless mouse. Great Customer service; but they will contact U if u leave a bad review....",2021,08
"Worked fine the first 20 minutes on my computer- no lag. Then, it started being unresponsive, lagging and just a pain to work with. Don’t waste your time on this product.",2021,08
"Out of the box, I couldn't get this mouse to connect with my MacBook (2017 pro). I gave up after 10 min of trying then tried again in a couple days. Now, it does connect but its unusable. The mouse moves 1mm on my screen for a huge amount of movement (and yes, I checked the tracking speed in my settings). Clicking on anything takes about 5 tries and scrolling is impossible. I'm upset by the deceitful overall rating of this mouse. I swear there are bots falsely giving this mouse good ratings.",2021,08
Works as claimed. Lights are pretty. Battery keeps it charged for several days. I do not use it for gaming so I don't know how it would perform. For me and my web searches it works great and performs as expected. I would buy it again.,2021,08
"Feels very comfortable to use ,lightweight.Compatable with MAC.",2021,08
"This mouse is terrible. I bought it for work, its not like I needed anything super advanced, just something that would give me a little more space than the touchpad. This mouse skips when you move it, and if you want to click something you have to hit the button 3 or 4 times. It's also very uncomfortable in the hand.",2021,08
"I bought this cause its wireless and has come cool led lights. Works great, no complaints. Yes I would recommend!",2021,08
"Works about 10% of the time, making it more frustrating than if it was literally useless. 10/10 paperweight, doesn’t work as a mouse though.",2021,08
Great value mouse. Does it job and can't complain with this price,2021,08
"Ordered this for my 9th grader, she has a laptop provided by her school and she received a laptop from her grandparents as a gift. Easy to switch between laptops with this mouse, so she can watch YouTube and play games on her personal laptop, and scroll and jump between apps easily on the school laptop. Of course its not as solid as the Apple version, so thats why not 5 stars",2021,08
I love this! Works great and love the lights 😊😊,2021,08
Awful product. You have to turn it on and off all throughout the day to get it to work. Horrible.,2021,08
We received this mouse on June 25 and the return window closed on Jul 25. Mouse stopped working yesterday - without accident or warning. So disappointed.,2021,08
Works as advertised! Great price!,2021,08
"I used this mouse once, after this use it died so I was going to charge it up figuring I didn't give it enough time to charge... I tried 3 different times and it wouldn't charge at all so I decided to just go back to my old mouse. I tried to remove the usb and the metal part broke off and stayed inside my laptop so I had to remove it and there was no fixing it. I'm so disappointed in the quality of this mouse.",2021,08
"this product is crap, do not buy, opened fresh out of the box and immediately had trouble. lightweight and cheap feeling, does not slide particularly well, although sleek, it isn't the most ergonomic thing. but worst of all, after plugging in and turning on, the mouse will work normally for around 30 secs, if you leave it idle for longer than that, the response becomes choppy and the mouse essentially stops working. tried on multiple devices to no avail. DO NOT BUY, in most cases id say you get what you pay for, but here it feels like even less than that.",2021,08
Broke within a week of having it.,2021,08
"Really like the way this wireless mouse feels & acts.  My last one died, and now I'm almost glad it did so I could buy this. Love the LED light color changing when it's in use, and the auto shutdown when it's not. It's performed well and moves easily.  Great value too.",2021,08
"I returned this mouse because I am a sucker for design even though it only worked for one day and ordered a replacement. The replacement mouse has lasted 5 weeks with intermittent issues. However, it no longer charges. Don’t waste your time and money",2021,08
 Moving fast and light easy to hold for moving,2021,08
"It's not very responsive but it does work. The lights are terrible but it does light up. As far as adjusting the DPI, I did not see a difference at all. I would not recommend for gaming but if you wanna surf the web on a smart TV its works well.",2021,07
The clicker doesn't work very good.,2021,07
Worked great in the beginning now it keeps disconnecting or won't connect at all. Super fustrating. It's not even that old.,2021,07
The laser stop working after having the mouse for about 2 months. Disappointing.,2021,07
Did not work at all with my dell precision laptop.,2021,07
It doesn't work,2021,07
I have this mouse for 3-4months now. It works great and the battery lasts for a very long time. I have only charged it 2-3 times since I got it and I use it everyday for work. Fits nicely in the palm of the hand and weighs like nothing. I enjoy the color changing mode option. Very good product.,2021,07
"Was nice until it stopped working after only a few weeks.  I wouldn't buy this again, not worth the money.",2021,07
Easy to set up and use. Like the slim design.,2021,07
Great mouse! Very fast and smooth. I was skeptical at the price being so cheap but wow! Fantastic item! I would definitely buy again... in fact I am getting a second one for my son for school.,2021,07
Great thin ergonomic mouse. Like the surrounding blue light,2021,07
Battery dies quickly especially if you have the changing light mode on.  Less than 1-2 days of battery life with 8-hr use.,2021,07
"The charging cord is so short and flimsy, it won’t stay connected to both pieces, so it is difficult to get a full charge. The mouse does not hold charge. After be left on the charger overnight, it is dead within five minutes use.",2021,07
"This mouse is great! It's sleek, responsive, and has awesome LED colors that rotate.Best bang for my buck...",2021,07
"I recently bought this mouse because I have used it before, but my previous mouse broke after having it for around 10 months, no big deal. The new mouse I bought does not hold a charge for very long at all. I can charge it for an hour or two and it dies after about 30 minutes. Next time I will buy another product.",2021,07
This is an amazing mouse! I would definitely buy again!,2021,07
It jus dies really quick but Mabye that’s cuz I leave it on and walk away cuz when I’m done using it I like to walk back into my room with it still on but otherwise I love it,2021,07
It was nice until it stopped working.  The return window literally closed yesterday,2021,07
Cool,2021,07
I’ve been wanting a mouse for a while and I’m glad I purchased this one. I use it to game and edit my videos and it really comes in handy. It’s better than than track pad and any other mouse in my opinion.,2021,07
"The mouse definitely makes a difference when it comes to the clicking sound. Everyone is glad there is no more of that! It’s slim, rechargeable, and decent looking!",2021,07
"It functions very well as a wireless mouse, the USB C adapter it comes with is very handy for the new Apple computers which only have USB C ports. The lights are cool as well, but more importantly the mouse is sturdy and doesn't feel cheap.",2021,07
Quiet & precise.,2021,07
The mouse does not hold a charge . It goes dead within 24 hours .,2021,07
"I was super exited about this product for my laptop, sadly it didn’t even work after a week. I tried everything to get this mouse to work, charging for two days, try it on a different computer. Nothing helped. The mouse didn’t even use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements.",2021,07
"My stapler has destroyed uncountable mouse's by stapling through the cord. That is one headache I'll not miss. Thank you, it's a wonderful product.",2021,07
Bought this for an office laptop.  It works great!,2021,07
"I don't like the sleep mode if that's what it is that makes me have to press the button every time I want to use it again.  I'd rather it just stay on.  Also, it has to be recharged every 3 days and I'm not a big computer user so that's a pain because I have to change the cord and USB every time.",2021,07
Battery only lasted 2 hrs after fully charged. Not recommend. Returning it.,2021,07
I love the sleek design and silence of it. Helps out alot when doing school at night and the lights around the side make it fun,2021,07
Did not work at all,2021,07
The mouse is comfortable to use with its very slim low profile. Its accuracy is normal or average to the regular computer user.  Mine did not come with the type C receiver. I assume it was sold once before and not checked to see if all parts were there before reselling. The most annoying thing about the mouse is having to charge over and over again. You have to remember to plug it in everyday for the user who is on the his or her computer a lot. There is no meter to check for how much battery is left and can be annoying when it starts being erratic because it needs juicing up. It seems to go into sleep mode really quickly so you will have to click a button to start moving again...a slight annoyance.  Not a bad mouse for the price but the annoying things about it have me going back to replaceable battery ones that I am used to using.  The colors are nice and pretty but you get over that really quick.,2021,07
Love my mouse. Love that it comes with the USB adapter. It was very easy to instal. Works perfectly.,2021,07
love this mouse. and the fact it goes to sleep of i forget to turn it off. even better i don't have to worry about batteries.,2021,07
"Works great. Only have to charge it once every 2 weeks, and I use it daily at the office.",2021,07
"My only issue is the color changing lights. I thought there would be an option to turn the LED lights off, have the light be one color, anything… but nope. It’s a disco the whole time. Not a bad thing I guess but also not great?",2021,07
"Bought these because it is rechargeable, however, the power ran out so quick! I need to charge it at least once a week!My previous mouse use batteries and I didn’t  need to change it for at least half of a year!",2021,07
"It barely lasts a few hours before having to recharge it, which is annoying. I think it is because of the LED lights, which drain the power.",2021,07
The product is as shown in the picture,2021,07
"This is great for remote work or personal use. True to description!!! Silent, sleek and easy to use. Bang for your buck for sure!!!",2021,07
I had initially given this 5 stars BUT it stopped charging after a couple of weeks.....asked for a replacement and received a different version of the one I initially had that never held a charge. Returning BOTH of them for a refund.,2021,07
Love this mouse. It’s so pretty to look at. And it DOES the job.,2021,07
"It’s been a few months and still works well! Very nice purchase, Thank you !",2021,07
Works Great,2021,07
"I really like this mouse-pretty, catchy color (rose gold); and it maneuvers so gentle and smoothly.",2021,07
I love how it lights up and is comfortable for for my hand!,2021,07
I purchased this for daily use. Although the design and colors were neat ended up breaking. This is not a durable mouse not usb. Another downfall is the light in the mouse could be blinding at times. The mouse dropped once and broke.,2021,07
Excellent mouse for the price,2021,07
I don't like the fact I have to charge it to use it.  It's a pain if I don't remember to plug it in.,2021,07
This mouse meets all my needs and it looks so cute among my setup. I love the RGB lights it projects and how smooth and quiet the clicks are. Definitely recommend!,2021,07
I love it.  I would recommend.,2021,07
Easily hooked up to my laptop and works like a charm!,2021,07
Not sure if the one I got was just defective but the tracker did not seem to work very well. As an analyst I need something with a smooth path and this mouse started/stopped very abruptly.I had to return it.,2021,07
"I was super excited for this mouse. Its so sleek and small, it was perfect for me. Unfortunately it doesn't work all that well. Its super glitchy, especially when you turn it on color mode. It lags and sometimes it doesn't even click on what you're trying to click on. Its much easier to just use my mouse pad on my computer.",2021,07
"I loved the design and cool light features, but true to the old saying... you get what you pay for.  This mouse was pretty bad.  It jumps and skips all over the page and you have to click the left mouse button 2 or 3 times before it responds to your request.  Very frustrating to say the least.  Not a good buy...",2021,07
"It's the cutest mouse. I like how sleek it is, and the colors change all the time. Charge up the mouse and it lasts a long time. Now that I have a pink mouse, it's time to find a pink keyboard.",2021,07
I love it and the multicolored,2021,07
"Love the pretty lights, just wish that the charge would last longer. Still, even with pretty long hours of gaming and accidentally leaving it on, the battery lasts a solid 12 hours. Would recommend, good for the price that's for sure",2021,07
"I had to replace my mouse and decided to try this mouse out since it had a lot of reviews. It works great!The mouse looks good and has a sleek design. The LED lights are a fun touch and the DPI feature is nice to have. I had zero issues connecting the mouse to my MacBook wirelessly to with the USB-C port.What I did notice was my hand started to feel uncomfortable with only an hour of use. Coming from a mouse that had an arch in the design, this mouse was a little flatter than that.Another are the clicks and scrolls. It definitely is not quiet when it comes to clicking and scrolling. It's not loud like compared to regular mice, but it is louder than my previous quiet mouse.I did end up returning the mouse, but I would still recommend this to those who like this mouse design. It's still a great mouse overall.",2021,07
"Horrible piece of trash, worst mouse ever, don't buy this.",2021,07
Works great. Nice and smooth feel,2021,07
It’s flimsy and the battery doesn’t last long you constantly have to charge and you can’t put batteries waste of money,2021,07
Product was defective.,2021,07
"This is the second wireless mouse I purchased - both the same.  The first one works great - have had it for a while and love the look and feel.  The second one started sticking and locking up shortly after purchasing.  It's hit-or-miss - some days it's fine, other days I want to throw it out the window!",2021,07
"At first i just loved the mouse and it was so pretty when I turn on the lights. But when it was time to recharge, and it just never recharged, and I tried and tried for well over a day.  Its dead and only two weeks old.  So disappointed. So I will be purchasing another wireless mouse from another company instead.  Simply not worth my time to fuss with returning etc.",2021,07
Pretty colors and does the job!,2021,07
A+,2021,07
"This mouse works very well, holds a good charge and is easy to connect and transport as I travel quite a bit.",2021,07
Nice,2021,07
Returned it,2021,07
Does not work at all. Lights come on but it doesn’t connect to dongle and does nothing.,2021,07
I thought it was fantastic at first. Wirked great for me at work. Now the wheel keeps popping out of place and doesnt work.,2021,07
"This mouse captures the eye because of the constant changing colors. I also like the feel of it, it's not bulky and big. I think its a great investment, good for kids and gaming :-)",2021,07
The mouse is very easy to use and automatically connected to the computer. I would definitely recommend this mouse to others.,2021,07
Easy to set up and it’s definitely quite.,2021,07
I/10 Do not recommend.  This mouse worked all of 2 days.  I changed the batteries and it still does not work.  Spend your money on a basic mouse that works.,2021,07
"Don't waste your time with this mouse. I got this mouse for my work because the wireless mouse that I had was loaned to me. Straight from the box, it didn't even work. It will light up red whenever I turn it on, it won't connect to my MAC at all even with the c port installed. It wouldn't work. AT ALL. I switched it off and on. I replugged in the c port. nothing would work. What a waste of money.",2021,07
"This is user friendly, works well and holds a charge for a long time. I would buy it again",2021,07
Great mouse definitely got my money worth,2021,07
Love this item works great never needs batteries light portable,2021,07
Colors are fun. But it doesn’t react great. Charge doesn’t last long if you forget to turn it off over night.  When it’s low on battery it doesn’t work well. Overall it’s an inconvenience.. amending my review to include the following.  If you post a bad review the company hassles you by email to take it down. First by offering a refund. When you tell them not interested they then offered 30 bucks. You can’t pay me to take a review down.  That’s the point of a review. Just make a better product.  You should just refund me.,2021,07
Battery won’t charge. I guess you get what you pay for. Save the 15$ or whatever this cost is and invest in something better.Wow. Don’t trust these other reviews guys. If you write a bad review aka the truth they will ask you to delete it. If the product doesn’t work obviously people are going to say something. Save your money people and buy from someone else that is better quality.,2021,07
"UPDATE: SELLER HAS SENT MULTIPLE EMAILS ASKING ME TO REMOVE THIS REVIEW IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY, CLAIMING ""This is an email from Amazon costumer service.""This is the 2nd purchase for me.  The first one wasn't labeled ""Upgrade.""  It lasted about 6 months until I dropped it on the floor.  This one, the ""Upgrade,"" doesn't work well at all.  The left and right click are very touchy and the scrolling drags and skips across pages.  The connectivity was also delayed.  Despite trying different computers and different settings, the problems persisted.  Returned the ""Upgrade.""",2021,07
"This mouse is fun!  It works well, keeps it’s charge and is nice to watch.",2021,07
May as well just leave it connected to the computer. Needs constant recharging…,2021,07
Product doesn’t stay connected,2021,07
14 Days of usage and Dead. Will not charge anymore but it worked great for 13 days.,2021,07
I've had this for a few weeks and it's already useless - it won't charge when connected. Horrible!,2021,07
It disconnects at times requiring you to unplug the USB connection and reconnect.,2021,07
This product works great very lightweight and smooth easy to and  use easy setup the lights on it makes it look so neat. I definitely recommend this product.,2021,07
This mouse is ridiculously cheap. Do not buy! Garbage!!!!!!!,2021,07
"I mean, this is a wireless mouse that has pretty lights and stuff, but I swear it doesn't catch well and I have to slide it like a pro curler. Either it dies really fast or it just decides to stop properly working, not sure what the true issue is. I like the texture and how sleek it is, but when it doesn't properly work, it drives me absolutely nuts. I even got a mouse pad and it still gives me issues...",2021,07
good product but the recharging part is inconvenient,2021,07
"Love the slim design, easier on the wrist. The buttons have good feedback as well.",2021,07
Works great!,2021,07
Amazon increasingly started to provide no name/no SN/no model description (= poor quality) merchandise which fail to operate out of the box.  They may or may not function.,2021,07
"Ehh it’s ok, a good hold me over",2021,07
This mouse was amazing. Two weeks after I received the mouse it went nuts.  If you move right it goes down left it goes up. Does not work right it takes more time to figure out what it is doing than actually functioning.  Worst mouse ever.,2021,07
The ball already broke.,2021,07
"Love it! I’m a teacher and the kids love to watch the color change, it has a soft click so is perfect for progress monitoring so students don’t hear the click. No more messing with batteries, stays charged for a long time!  I’d buy another one in a heartbeat.",2021,07
Long battery life and I get so many compliments on the lights! Exactly what I wanted.,2021,07
It was easy to install and worked the first time.,2022,06
I loved my mouse and it worked great I loved the light show and the fast response time with no lagging from the mouse then at 2 weeks into having the mouse the type c reciever that made the mouse work broke off i was so bummed because i really liked the mouse so i took a leap of faith and contacted the company to ask for a replacement on just the receiver so that i could use my mouse and they immediately apologized for the inconvenience and sent me a brand new set at no cost a lovely lady named Iris helped me out. Thank you for being an honest company that stands behind the products you sell I'm a customer for life !!!!! Don't hesitate to buy this item you wont regret it.,2021,07
"IUPDATED:  (11-13-21). Returned and bought another as I really liked the way it fit my hand, etc.  The first one didn’t get charged til it was out and then wouldn’t recharge after it died.  I’ve plugged this one to charge more frequently and am happy to keep it.  Not going to let it die cuz don’t want to suffer finding out it’s a design flaw.  On the other hand, could have just been the one I first bought. I am so disappointed.  I received my pretty mouse, charged it and love it!  Fits my small hands, no clicking sounds, easy to use.  I received it around July 10.  Today is July 25 and the cursor won't work!!  I hadn't charged it so I plugged it in to charge.  The wheel still works but the clicker won't work.  When I press it, nothing happens.  I would exchange it for a new one but then I don't have many days left to see if it works and really don't want to take a chance on losing my money.  These mice seem to work great for some and don't work for some.  I may figure out which credit card gives a year warranty beyond the normal one which is non existent.  At least I could try again.",2021,07
"I bought it for my daughter and she loved it. This mouse is very light, well designed and easy to use. Light-up is also a very nice feature.",2021,07
I bought this mouse for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Would defiantly recommend this mouse and would purchase again especially for the price.,2021,07
Brought for work and very satisfied,2021,07
Worked great for about a month and then the button stopped clicking properly or at all.,2021,07
It is too small for average size hand. The mouse literally disappear in your hand. I used it for 10 minutes and it was very uncomfortable. My fingers do not rest on the buttons. They go over it. But The design and functionality is good. You will enjoy using this mouse if you have small hands.,2021,07
The adapter didnt work even though it said it would work with Mac airs… 😕☹️,2021,07
"Started off good. About 2 weeks in, it wouldn’t move. Fully charged.",2021,07
Love the color and led lights.,2021,07
I really like this mouse.,2021,07
"Works perfectly, colors are fun.  Still running on the first charge but I do turn it off if I'll be away from the computer for long.",2021,07
 It rechargeable and automatically goes to sleep mode when not using. Easy to use. Works great.,2021,07
"Love it iv had it for about 4 months now, and I can only recall  1 time it went dead. It wouldn't have went dead if it weren't  for me neglecting to charge it but it left on for a couple days. Other then that its a great mouse. I use it almost everyday and I only find myself charging it  about  once a month.",2021,07
Love everything about it!,2021,07
It fills the bill. Not too expensive. works fine.,2021,07
"It is the loudest mouse I have owned so far. It makes a weird internal noise that is a high pitch hum. The clicks are super loud. The scrolling is loud. It works great with a MacBook and does what is is suppose to but way too loud for me. Overall, not a fan and wouldn't recommend.",2021,07
" The mouse is very bright in the dark. I love the aesthetic of it. It’s very sleek and looks nice with my laptop. The battery lasts pretty long,(it stays on red when you need to charge it). Love that it is rechargeable so no need for batteries.",2021,07
Lasted about a week,2021,07
Big fan of this mouse. Works great and used for 5 strait days without needing a charge.,2021,07
Very easy to use and efficient!!,2021,07
Bought as a gift. She loved it.,2021,07
The mouse hooks up easily and does what it's advertised to do. Hassle-free.,2021,07
"This mouse is very light weight but not in a good way. It's so light it actually feels cheap. It takes a lot of getting use to because it is so light. After about three weeks, the mouse started to intermittently stop working. Now it's has fully stopped working after only a month. Pay the $2 more and get the Microsoft one. I've had that one for 4 years and never had an issue.",2021,07
"This was pretty frustrating to use, it kept shutting off and the tracking was pretty awful. I ended up throwing it away after about two weeks worth of use.",2021,07
As described,2021,07
"It started out great for about 2 days... now it works for 5 minutes and won't ""move"" the cursor around.",2021,07
I love this mouse very easy to use.  I love the way the lights change color it just makes working a brighter place,2021,07
"Scrolling is very easy and quick.  This mouse is slim and easy to Manuver.  I mostly love the ergonomic and backlighting design.  The sleep mode feature is nice, just have to remember to turn the mouse off, then on, to reactivate the scrolling feature.",2021,07
"Sleek, quite & cool light effect. Great price for a rechargeable mouse & no more batteries to replace.",2021,07
"I was super excited when I received this mouse with it’s comfort and of course, the pretty LED lights were cool. It came fully charged & worked great UNTIL after I charged it for the 1st time. Strange—it no longer worked! I could see a bit of red inside but the LED’s were gone and the curser wasn’t responsive to the mouse. Against better judgement I agreed to receive a free replacement giving it another chance— so I’ll follow up with a 2nd review!FOLLOW UP: 2nd one worked for 2 weeks and then STOPPED WORKING altogether. The company actually contacted me after submitting my initial review, offering full reimbursement if I’d take it down, followed by instructions on how to do so. I didn’t end up doing it & glad for it since this one was even worse! Ughhh, why do companies insist on selling products like this?!",2021,07
"I received this on a Friday and let it charge all day Saturday. Loved how it looked, the lights were fun.  It was, however, very flat and small.  I started using it on Monday... it was amazing; so quiet, so pretty. Here it is Wednesday, the lights no longer work and it is already dead.  Yes, I did power off every night. I'd much rather use a battery operated mouse.",2021,07
"I was tired of using a wireless mouse that needed change of batteries to quickly.  Lucky i found these wireless rechargeable mouse.  The first thing i did when the package arrived was to charge the mouse fully.  So far is working without problems.  The mouse is slim and very comfort.  The multicolored LED is a delightful touch that will be an excellent companion to the multicolored led mouse pad.  My review is based on regular use, i can't have opinion regarding how the mouse works for gaming because i just a controller for that.**update**After just a few months the surface of the mouse looks like is peeling and is very noticeable, even with proper cleaning.  The mouse keeps working and the LEDS.",2021,07
"Feels great, sleek. Different colors for different laptops, nice.",2021,07
Mouse does not take a charge when it dies. I do not recommend this product to anyone.,2021,07
"Initially I charged this mouse overnight and then used it for two eight hour days, turning it off overnight. A couple hours into using it on day 3 it died. I charged it for several hours and it has no juice and won't even turn on. I would think after a couple hours of charging it would at least turn on.",2021,07
"Previously drop mouse by accident and found right button is disable. Comment to seller and they were so generous to offer a refund, although merchandise has been used for sometimes. Compliments and respect to their excellent customer service and business attitude. Support their product again in future.",2021,07
Great mouse for work and gaming!,2021,07
It’s a good mouse.,2021,07
Im giving this a 3 because i got one in Black for my sister and she hasnt had any issues. I bought one in blue and the left click sticks. Not sure if it was dropped at some point prior to me receiving it or if there is inconsistent quality with the product. At the price its not worth the hassle of returning it to get a replacement.,2021,07
Love it! It’s so sleek and comfortable to use. Love the color and the light changing aspect!,2021,07
Stopped working and wouldn’t re-charge after a few weeks. Threw it away.,2021,07
"that was my first review but the mouse did not work.  the seller replaced it immediately and that one works fine.  again, be aware that this is a rechargeable mouse and you cannot replace the batteriesThe seller should’ve been clearer that this is a recharging mouse and I don’t know how you replace the rechargeable batteries so that’s the only complaintOtherwise it’s a great mouse",2021,07
"I gave up my mouse for this ""new"" mouse because it didn't work on the other laptop to make them happy. It would just stop working. Ordered a replacement on another review. Amazon refunded my money.",2021,07
I love this mouse! Not only is a silent mouse but it is light and also changes colors on the side. So far I have received compliments from my coworkers. They said it's a fancy mouse 😁,2021,07
It came quick,2021,07
"This is a compact, slim mouse.  I wouldn't call it ergonomic, just efficiently sized.  I just opened it, and I already hate it.  It isn't silent, the buttons are loud, and non-responsive.  I've had to click multiple times to get a response from the mhouse, and only a heavy loud click works. I'll be returning, and will continue the hunt for a replacement mouse.  It does look cool, but performs poorly.",2021,07
This mouse is great. It connected easily to my windows laptop as well as to my girlfriend's imac. I love that the clicking is quiet. I think I will get another one so we can each have one. The lights are cool but I am glad there is a switch to shut them off. That is actually a great feature.,2021,07
This is the worst purchase. Mouse doesn’t work. I have charged it multiple times and it loses connection. I would not purchase this model.,2021,07
"I bought this for my home office. I usually had to change the mouse batteries once in 2months because I always forget to turn off the mouse when I am not using it. Now with this one I don’t have to worry about all these things, just recharge and use it.",2021,07
"Can i just say, wow. This mouse is absolutely incredible. The wireless feature and led lights make this thing a steal for its price. It is super helpful when i want to stay in bed but still use my pc from afar. I can just pull this bad boy out and start going. It has silent clicks to it as well so you wont be waking or bothering anybody buy using this mouse. And with its low profile shape and structure, it takes up practically no room whatsoever!",2021,07
"Loveee, sooo pretty!!",2021,07
Really cool wireless mouse! I especially love the perfect ergonomic size and design AND the cool lights!,2021,07
" I just Love the colors. It is comfortable on your wrist. Great size, fits great in my slim laptop case.",2021,07
This is awesome I didn’t know it lit up different colors ( was just in a hurry online shopping) glad I got this works great,2021,07
I love itttttt,2021,07
It half works. I have to charge it a TON and I leave it off if I’m not using it. It also goes to sleep quick and takes *forever* to wake up. I’m not sure if I would order from them again.,2021,07
Mouse only last 2 hours after charging.,2021,07
Cool mouse I like it changes colors while using it LOVE THE FACT I NEVER HAVE TO USE BATTERIES AGAIN FOR A MOUSE.,2021,07
"Love this! Very sleek, very quiet and I actually love the lighting on the sides. I have had no issues. Plug and play!",2021,07
This mouse is good quality for a low price. I love the multi-colored LED lights on the side and middle. I chose the blue and feel like it adds a pop of color to my office! However- the blue paint is already peeling on the bottom and I've only used it a little while. Not sure if it came like that or is already wearing. There are probably other products for a similar price that could be better quality.,2021,07
"Cutest, stylish, clean looked mouse. I have white monitor and white keyboard it goes very well with those. Also it has lights and it’s super comfortable ergonomic. I’m happy with this purchase",2021,07
"The first day I received the product it worked very well, though I couldn't get seem to get it to charge. It had enough juice to get through the first day so I wasn't too concerned. By the second day, though, something had happened to the optical portion because moving the mouse often wouldn't move the cursor (and never moved it as fast as it should). The buttons all seem to work fine still, but without the ability to actually move the mouse as I want to it's pretty useless.",2021,07
"Works great! Color just like into the picture. The best thing is that it’s charge last for a very long time, I don’t have to charge it everyday!",2021,07
The mouse didn't work after the first few hours of use. Troubleshooting didn't work.,2021,07
It's basically junk doesn't hold a charge it works fine as long as its plugged into the charger but that defies the purpose of a wireless mouse,2021,07
Works very well but wish it had option for regular battery.,2021,07
Quit working after 2 weeks of use,2021,07
I love this mouse. If you have smaller hands or like a mouse that doesn’t feel to big in your hands then this is for you. The color and lights are a cool touch as well.,2021,07
"Doesn't stay connected. Hard to tell when charged. Has to be charged constantly which negates the convenience of cordless. It looks cute and feels good but obviously cheap plastic. I am returning it to buy a different mouse with better performance that uses a battery so does not need to be hooked up to a usb port and charged constantly.FYI: On 7/27, seller emailed me and wanted me to remove the review. They say they are switching manufacturers. ""Let the buyer beware.""",2021,07
"The mouse worked great; loved it, actually. But the charging cord is severed and while it does charge, it also will shock you a little if you accidentally touch it while plugging into charging port or plugging the mouse in. And because the charging cord is only 6 inches, hard to refrain from touching where it is severed. Will stop using this when a new (different!) mouse arrives.",2021,07
Responds quickly. Feels nice in my hand. Battery lasts a long time.,2021,07
Like the mouse but having to recharge it with USB all the time is annoying and unproductive.,2021,07
I like very easy to install and the color change on the mouse,2021,07
"for my laptop , iI got it on May 9th 2021 it did work for two months , and now it will not been chargeI can't use it anymore , I need to get a new one",2021,07
The mouse is very pretty and lights up.  Pretty silent when in use.  Its small in size,2021,07
"Confortable to use, silent clic and battery lasts a lot",2021,07
Everything arrived and performs great.,2021,07
Doesn't hold a charge very long.,2021,07
From the day I received all my touchpad headaches are gone. A wonderful product that keeps me enjoying the clicks without any noise. No headache of battery life. Recharge and go mouse that signals more than 10meters distance. The color attracts and keeps me cool during operation.,2021,07
"My granddaughter wanted this wireless mouse for her computer. It is SILENT when clicking. She likes that the colors change on the side when using it. Overall, she is happy with it.",2021,07
 Sleek design and very responsive.  And most 9f all it sleeps when you're not using it.,2021,07
Like this mouse work good,2021,07
"It's exactly as bad as I should have expected for the price. I've had it for 3 days and it will randomly stop working. I have to turn it off and on again to get the mouse to begin working again. The plastic it's made out of is cheaper than it looks in the picture. Honestly, I should have spent a few more bucks and bought something better.",2021,07
I like my new mouse. I needed an inexpensive yet durable mouse and this one has been great so far. I have only used it for a day but so far so good. Great purchase.,2021,07
"It's a cool mouse, but I don't think it's worth the price. Whenever I use it, my curser ocassionally jerks around the screen and makes it difficult to use. It's not my computer's fault because I switched mouses and the other one works fine. Also, the color changing lights are see-through from the top (I got a white one) and it kind of ruins the feel. It just feels really cheap. Honestly though, if it was maybe $5 cheaper and it didn't glitch the curser I'd say it's worth it. I like how you can charge it rather than switching out batteries, and I like how it comes with a lightning USB adapter.",2021,07
"Love this little guy! The colors are fun, they change everytime the mouse moves! Helps you to remember to turn it off! Easy to charge with USB, glides smooth! Totally love it!",2021,07
"Worked great for a month. Mouse connects via a USB receiver. I've only disconnected the receiver a few times when not using the mouse. However, after disconnecting a few times, I can't reconnect the receiver without it being ""loose"": the instant my mouse connects, it will disconnect because the USB is too loose now. After a MONTH.Edit: Customer service reps have reached out to me, offering me money to delete my review.",2021,07
"I like the change in color but this is definitely not a gaming mouse. I needed an alternative to keep me in the works so I chose something that was cheap and nice looking. Its silent and has a nice speed to it, not too much sensitivity.",2021,07
"This Mouse was Amazing when i first got it and it worked amazing for the first few months. Then i started having connecting issues, so i direct hooked it up to my PC and it worked like that for a Day. Now it Doesnt work at all. Dont Waste your money on this.",2021,07
I needed a wireless mouse and specifically wanted one that matched my new laptop. This mouse exceeded my expectations. I love the that it lights up and comes in a variety of colors. It's kinda hard to find a silver mouse especially one that is compatible with a Type  C usb so I am happy.,2021,07
"a waste of my money, doesn’t even charge on my laptop. But hey, guess you get what you pay for cause this is crap.",2021,07
works like a charm,2021,07
looks so cool,2021,07
"Started out pretty good but after about 3 weeks the mouse no longer tracks properly. Even after charging all night, after about 1 to 2 minutes of use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements.",2021,07
Wasn’t sure I’d like the smooth style of the mouse but I love it! Gonna buy one in another color as a backup just incase,2021,07
This is a great & economical mouse. Love the colored LED lights and works perfectly. Great deal!,2021,07
Very easy to set up! Works perfectly fine with my MacBook Air.,2021,06
"Beautiful LEDs, mouse works great.",2021,06
"Great product, very easy to use and understand, sleek design too!",2021,06
The click wheel stopped working two days after the return window. The colors are pretty. It's a fun mouse but pretty basic.  I would not buy this again,2021,06
I love the light on the side that’s what draw my attention to this beautiful mouse . And I have been looking fir a quite mouse for awhile and this is it .,2021,06
Great mouse! Speak design. No clicking noises. Really pretty and easy to use!,2021,06
 So far so good.  I had a previous mouse that gave out after 6 months.  And check the cool colors!,2021,06
I love it ! It works perfect and I love that it changesColors if you want 🙏🏻,2021,06
Love how soft and quiet it is. Super happy !!,2021,06
"I like the design; however, the charge does not last long.",2021,06
Love it! Definitely worth the buy.,2021,06
"*Update* Since writing this review they have emailed me twice offering a $10 refund if I took the review down. When I didn’t reply they offered me a $30 refund (?) again in return I would have to remove the review. They stated they were a small company and my review was hurting them… but with over 15,000 reviews, I don’t see how that’s possible…The light goes off like it is charged, however, it won’t turn on more than about 10 seconds. I’ve tried 2 different charging cords and same thing happens. Don’t waste your money.",2021,06
"This was gifted to me as I was in need of a better mouse for working at home. Very comfortable to hold, able to right-click and easy set up. No issues, highly recommend this mouse.",2021,06
nice and smooth. nice to just connect to pc to charge and not get batteries.itd be cool if they had software to control the lightsit goes into standby mode super fast. not a negative or positive trait.,2021,06
"Don't buy it, waste your money.",2021,06
"The mouse is slim, lightweight, and has beautiful colors. The paint has started to rub off and I have only used it for maybe 2 weeks. I can tell it will not last too long.",2021,06
It is ergonomic and love the color.  It works well and is pretty quiet when clicking and scrolling.,2021,06
"Basically bought this for work.  Very light, which is good to use for.  Don’t have to fight with the wired mouse anymore.  Like the light that comes with it, goes with a good gaming system.Overall very well built.",2021,06
"I wish the charger was longer it’s so short. I used it once and the mouse was not calibrated. I had to bang it a couple of times then it worked. Buying a new one, I do not recommend this product.",2021,06
The photo is misleading. Only one color shows at a time.  Mouse is not as accurate as most.,2021,06
"This mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews. It is light, good to hold, and has good battery life. It is also quiet (with exceptions–see below)Its main problem however is that the middle button (the scrollwheel) becomes unusable after only a short amount of use. After which, the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register a button press.Also, compared to the LMB & RMB buttons (which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally), the MMB is extremely rigid in comparison. It is also very noisy, which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent. It is much more noisy than other mice I have used (which is about 20).As someone who relies on this button during daily usage, this is very frustrating, and frankly a serious design flaw. I'd like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well (i.e, not rough). I also bought the non-LED version of this mouse, and the *exact same problem* appeared after the same amount of time.Another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low, leaving one to guess when to recharge it.It often becomes erratic (mouse pointer moves around) and does not register movement well, requiring a power cycle. This is occuring on more than one system.All in all a decent attempt, but quite a few issues need to be ironed out. I doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than a couple of weeks usage, as these issues are consistent and appeared after 2-3 months.Frankly, I expect a mouse to last _significantly longer_, and also have a useable middle mouse button. I hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer.",2021,06
"UPDATE: I have been sent 4 emails from the seller begging me to change my review, 2 of the emails offered me $40 to do so. This explains the positive reviews despite the terrible product.the mouse freezes constantly. left and right click will work but the mouse will not move. this is the worst mouse i've ever had. it also goes into sleep mode after 10 minutes of not being used, which is annoying and no way to turn it off. the light also stays on while in sleep mode which doesn't make sense. the charge doesn't last very long at all, charging it every couple of days.",2021,06
I like this for school,2021,06
It stopped working after about 2 weeks even after being fully charged.,2021,06
 I just live my cordless keyboard and mouse. They match my HP desktop computer perfectly.,2021,06
"The Good- looks nice and feels good in your hand. The Bad- the right click button is too sensitive, I'm constantly opening up the right click menu. The pointer freezes and I have to turn the mouse off and on to unfreeze it. The Ugly- I ordered a silver mouse and I got dark gray.",2021,06
"So for anyone wondering, charging it is easy. If you plug it and the light in the middle is blue, that means that it is not fully charged. The blue light will turn off after being fully charged. Mine arrived on Monday and on Wednesday it turned off. I plugged it in and took around 2.5 hours to charge it (the light turned off). The clicks are silent and is very comfortable to use. One thing I do not like is the ""scroller,"" which can be a little too hard (I tend to open many tabs at once, at work and while I am on Pinterest lol) but that's just me. Overall, is a nice mouse and I hope it can stay with me forever (this is my 4th mouse in less than a year).",2021,06
"This mouse is a perfect addition to your laptop. It is easy to set up, very affordable, and the ergonomic design reduces hand fatigue.",2021,06
I needed an ultraslim mouse for my laptop and this one works great. My only complaint (if you can call it that) is its length. It would fit better in my carry case if it were shorter.,2021,06
 Awesome mouse is totally silent durable case feels completely comfortable in my hand.  Love the colors.,2021,06
"I like the simplicity and sleekness of this mouse, along with the changing colors. Everything works fine so far.",2021,06
Mine doesn’t change color but it’s slim and works awesome,2021,06
"I haven't had any issues at all using this mouse. It feels great, the silent clicks and LED lights add a really cool touch to it as well!",2021,06
It barely works. I went back to the mouse I was using when I bought this (which is on its last leg) and it works 10x better still. Skip this product.,2021,06
I like the fact that you can recharge this mouse.....I spend a fortune on batteries and was looking for something I could recharge and it works great...,2021,06
"Came charged. Has an off, on, and then the color switch. Quiet quick. My favorite mode is that when it’s idle for a while it shuts down and you just click and it comes back to life. Exactly what I wanted. Easy USB charge. Hope it lasts me for a while!!",2021,06
"I bought two of these to use with our laptops. Both computers recognized them right away and we were able to use them easily. I like the variety of colors offered and the lower profile, so my hand doesn't cramp like it has with some other styles. The light up colors are fun. I think it was a good value for the money.",2021,06
It's a nice little mouse - It's actually pretty high quality for how cheap it was,2021,06
Mouse does not hold charge.,2021,06
"Unfortunately I had to return it. It's cute and true the color,  however, it does work for my laptop",2021,06
perfect,2021,06
"THIS MOUSE IS NOT BLUETOOTH COMPATIBLE, USB ONLY",2021,06
Don’t waste your money. Stopped working after 2 days of use. Doesn’t hold a charger either.,2021,06
"It takes too long to wake up and the battery dies quickly.  The instructions were terrible.  I have no idea what the two ON settings are for as they are not addressed at all.  Seems to do what a basic mouse is supposed to do, but i would look elsewhere for a higher quality next time.",2021,06
"Don’t buy this! I thought it would be convenient not to have to worry about replacing batteries, I was wrong! I used it one day and it hasn’t held a charge since! Huge waste of money!",2021,06
This mouse is really useful for my laptop and it was really easy to sey up. The style and color of the mouse really matches the description.,2021,06
My son uses the mouse for gaming on his MacBook Air.,2021,06
the wheel stopped working after 3 weeks,2021,06
"Is easy to install, ergonomic and functional",2021,06
Bad quality already broke USB stick stopped working,2021,06
"I purchased this wireless mouse to use with a laptop.  I purchased it on Amazon due to the slimness, color, and uniqueness.  I am exceptionally happy with the mouse and would recommend!",2021,06
I love this little mouse. It's so small and sleek and fits in my hand nicely it moves quickly I use several screens at work and it moves from 1 to another without any problem and it's fun that it lights up too.,2021,06
"Works well enough. Sleep mode is not great. It REALLY goes to sleep. And the charge does not hold for 7 days. But again, well works well enough. If you're looking for a kinda cool mouse, aesthetically, this will work. The gray is gorgeous.",2021,06
"Looks great, feels comfortable however when lifting the mouse, it would shoot the cursor all over the screen which can be frustrating when playing games or working on detailed spreadsheets.",2021,06
"The major flaw with the mouse for me is that the battery life is almost nonexistent. It lasts only about 2 hours for me. I'm guessing the one I got may be defective because I need to have this plugged in all the time to make it usable. But I can't  work that way. Not factoring in the battery, everything else is great in comparison to other mice in this price range.",2021,06
Jusk ok Good quality,2021,06
Very nice mouse. Enjoy the colorful addition.,2021,06
"I ordered silver and received black, not worth the time to return it but a bit disappointing. Quality/functions as expected",2021,06
Cool looking mouse and dazzling light colors!,2021,06
"I was looking forward to not having to use batteries and not have to worry about wires. It was great at first and I really liked it ... then ... after about a week, the charge did not even last a day and then it quit even charging. Don't waste your money. The only silver lining is that I had used my reward points, so there was no out of pocket.",2021,06
" Feels good in my hand and works well. The roller wheel works as a third button which is important for my work. Colors are pretty and you can turn the lights off so that's a bonus. It charges so no batteries and I'm loving that. The only issue I'm finding is that it goes to sleep very fast. If you wait to long to move it, you have to click the power like next to the roller wheel. Not a big deal just annoying sometimes. Overall I'm happy with it.",2021,06
It came really fast. I got it in one day! It is really sleek and works really smooth. I chose my favorite color of course but I love all the colors the light goes through! I also really like that it has a button to keep the mouse on but turn off the light! And of course it is nice that you can charge it rather than use batteries. The other mouse I have have to use batteries so that was a major selling point for this one!,2021,06
This item was not compatible with my work laptop.  There was no way to connect for charging. The feel was great as it is whaIt I consider a low-rise for my hand and wrist.,2021,06
Works great. I would prefer if it would not light up like a rainbow.,2021,06
Good mouse very smooth,2021,06
Works very well on any surface. Colors flow well. Well worth the money.,2021,06
"This mouse is AMAZING!!! It’s quiet, it lights up, it doesn’t die fast. I love it!!!",2021,06
As soon as I took this out of the box I knew that I was probably going to be sending it back. It looks nice in the picture but it is a piece of cheap plastic. It felt so cheap that I just couldn't even use it I sent it right back.,2021,06
"The design is beautiful, the led lights make the mouse look amazing specially in dark places. I love the fact that it doesn’t make a click sound, it charges very fast and it lasts very long! Great price for such a great product!",2021,06
The mouse stopped working after 30 days!,2021,06
"I have had this mouse for all of 15 minutes and I am planning on returning it.Honestly it looks nice and I like that it's rechargable.However, it's easily one of the worst I've ever used (I've used probably 50 different models in my career alone). First, clicking the mouse requires much stronger force than any other mouse I've used and on top of that it's very inconsistent. Looking through the gaps where the LEDs show out of I can see the mechanical device which actuates the click is a tiny plastic arm. No chance that will lasts for an expected period of time.It seemed to have been packaged fine, so I don't believe it was damaged or DOA.Don't buy this.",2021,06
It’s sleek and comfortable and the battery lasts forever once charged!!! It’s great! And it fits anywhere!,2021,06
This is a great value mouse. I purchased it to go with my new laptop so I didn’t have to depend on the trackpad. The design is nice and colors are a great addition.,2021,06
This mouse feels very smooth and lightweight.  Easy to use and one charge seems to last forever,2021,06
" I just needed a simple mouse for a desktop I only use for watching videos in my living room. Its super quiet and lightweight, no lag. I'm also using it for cricut designspace, with no issues.",2021,06
It's light and lights up so nifty,2021,06
Didn’t work after 2 days,2021,06
"I needed a wireless mouse for my new laptop and found this to be a reasonable price.  It is a great design, usb dongle can mount under the mouse itself for travel so you don’t lose it, as it is very compact (which is really nice for a laptop).  Has two modes, one is “on” and the other mode is on with color.  It’s nice to have the option as to be able to save battery life.  The mouse clicks are silent which was a different experience for me, but it’s nice.  It does go into standby mode if not used to save battery and takes a couple seconds to “wake up” but to me this is better than killing the battery.  All in all this was a good purchase!",2021,06
"For the price this mouse is quite good. Top of the mouse is soft touch material. It is comfortable to use( not too big or small). I also like color of the  light that always changes while I am using the mouse. I am using this mouse for 3 months, my daughter have not broken it yet lol.",2021,06
"This mouse feels great in your hands. You don't have to worry about it being difficult to click or scroll, as the placement of the buttons are all easy to use and find. It also really does light up in different colors. It also has a setting where you can turn off the light and still use the mouse. It is rechargeable through usb, and the battery seems to last a while. Overall, pretty good.",2021,06
"This mouse works very well and has a very long battery life, very happy with this purchase.",2021,06
Works very well thanks.,2021,06
"It’s cute & pink & is just like the picture! It’s a really nice mouse, but I’m sad that it doesn’t work with my iPad. I put photos of the manual, and it says that mouse needs a USB-port to operate. I think that black USB goes into computer and communicates with the one beneath the mouse.",2021,06
"Mouse only worked half the time, then never held a charge.",2021,06
**Update**After using the mouse for around 4 days it just completely stopped working. The lights come on and it appears to charge but the buttons no longer work and the optical lens doesn't pick up any movement. Don't even bother with this. It's trash.Not a very reliable mouse.  After just a couple days of use it stops working intermittently which is frustrating. I wouldn't purchase again. That said it is a very quiet mouse with no audible click and it's a good size.,2021,06
The mouse stopped working after only two months of using it. Pretty disappointing,2021,06
"Style , Good, Long battery lifeSpeed . I love mine .",2021,06
"First and foremost, it is exaclty as stated. Works, charges, lights up, and connects to USB-C (dongle) out the box.It is exaclty what you are paying for. I am using it on a Samasung Galaxy Pro 360, expensive computer cheap mouse. It works perfectly.I do have two concerns. It's cheap, looks cheap, and the color looks to me as it will fade in time.Second, the dongle sticks out alot. Too much for my liking.That said, this computer doesn't need a mouse, I just wanted one for laziness purposes.The product is as stated, but cheap. Great for a college student or a travel mouse.",2021,06
"It's a soft click, which I like. Love the colors and I truly get about 2 weeks of using it as my work mouse.",2021,06
"If you only need to use a mouse for no more than an hour, this might be okay. I bought 3: 1 for my office, 1 for my laptop bag, and 1 for home. They do not hold a charge.",2021,06
love it,2021,06
Automatically sets up.,2021,06
"I bought this mouse recently for a new laptop I bought and it is perfect! The mouse is an extremely portable, wireless mouse. It actually feels very comfortable while using it. Theres no side buttons or extras on it, just a simple, portable mouse that cna connect via USB or with the included USB-C to USB adapter. I recommend this mouse because of the price and what you get for it!",2021,06
Battery life lasts an exceptionally long time.,2021,06
Stopped working after 2 weeks. Would not buy again.,2021,06
"The features on this mouse are really good.  It worked well initially but after only 3 days, it wouldn't work anymore and ended up in the garbage.  I do not recommend buying this one.",2021,06
I would definitely buy this again. I really enjoy this mouse.,2021,06
"I like the overall design.  The slim profile and touch is good and the clicks are responsive.Where I'm struggling with this mouse is that as I'm trying to work, there is lag and the mouse will then jump around on the screen.  Also, trying to hold and highlight a group of text, for some reason it loses connection.  what I've ended up having to do is clicking on my document and then using my Shift+Arrow Keys to highlight the text that I need.For general web browsing, this mouse isn't bad.  For productivity, it's not really working for me and i'm going to go back to my wired mouse.",2021,06
Love this mouse. Work excellent!!,2021,06
did not work with my older dell computer,2021,06
"Lightweight, comfortable, and cool with the lights. Rechargable is a major plus",2021,06
I bought this mouse for work and it worked great the first month! However after a month it started working slower and slower and just stopped working. Not a good use of money.,2021,06
Hi love it but I bought it because it changed colors and it only stays on red.,2022,06
"This is a great mouse to have if you are trying to have a mouse that can be used on a type c only device while keeping the option of normal USB open. I love having it light up and it's cool thing to have in my office. If you want to use the type c port. It will need to be attached via adapter. The adapter will stick out unfortunately so be careful as you can damage the adapter. It does have a slot so you can install the dongle (not the adapter) to the mouse itself. The default plug is just a normal USB port. The mouse feels pretty nice. It does feels pretty smooth. There is no real lag or drifting with this mouse. It does have a built in battery which is super nice. You are able to just recharge the mouse by plugging it directly into your laptop via micro USB. I was able to use it for quite some time before the battery died and initial charging only took a about 4 hours. It does have a sleep mode from what I can tell to save battery life when you are not using it but it does have an ON and OFF button if you need it. The mouse moves pretty well across most surfaces and clicking is pretty responsive. Im not a gamer,, so can't give any recommendations on that.. The LED light works pretty well with the color. You can adjust the color via the center button. The bottom has pads but they are not the soft silicone like pads. It feels like a hard material. This is a plug in play and works great with mac and PC. It does not look like it has a way of adjusting the DPI but it has a pretty good default DPI already so I do not see the need to adjust it. Overall I think this is a great mouse.",2021,06
Bought on prime day for a great price. It was easy to sync to my laptop. Comfortable grip.  I have been using for a couple of days the charge lasted longer than expected. Functions wonderfully. I did not use it for gaming so I can not accurately rate that.,2021,06
I purchased the same mouse that my granddaughter enjoys.  It works smoothly and is a pleasure to use.  It will provide ease and a more enjoyable computer experience.,2021,06
"Great mouse, especially for the price. The LED lights are awesome!!! Works perfect, and easily connects to your device!!",2021,06
This needs to charge very often. I wish I knew that before purchasing.,2021,06
Great wireless louse. Easy to connect and the charges lasts all day,2021,06
Stopped working for no apparent reason,2021,06
Works great. Highly recommend this product. Nothing to dislike.,2021,06
"the mouse works great except the right button doesn't always copy paste on various web pages. After receiving the new mouse, the problem is the web page design because the same problem occurs. I tried a different brand mouse with the same result.",2021,06
It’s a simple yet sleek looking mouse. I’ve been using it for almost a month and have no concerns about it. I recommend it.,2021,06
I like the way it handles while moving it.  I think it is a little small for a big hand.  It is cute and colorful.  I have not played any games with it yet but I am sure it will be quick and smooth.,2021,06
"I love that I do not need batteries !! It recharges fairly quick !!Slim design , fits my had perfectly !! I also love I can turn it off !!",2021,06
I like this mouse but the battery literally died in a day.  Charging it now see how long that takes.  I say 50/50,2021,06
Even with sleep mode the battery doesn’t last a full work day.,2021,06
"Love how quiet the mouse is, love that it came with an adapter for usb-c, love the recharging capabilities, very nice feel in the hand!One thing is, i wish i would have gotten the color that i wanted. I wanted Silver but got Gray. :/",2021,06
Great mouse like the colors and sleekness. Also rechargeable!,2021,06
Feels very cheap and performs cheap too. both sides stick together when wanting to use just the left side button but they both go down and pop wen going back up. difficult to click on just a single item!,2021,06
"Worked fine at first, about a month in and now it gets glitchy for no reason. Flat design makes for poor support of hand. Not for gaming.",2021,06
Used this mouse twice. Went to use it a third time and it was completely dead. The led’s were still working but the mouse light underneath flickers then shuts off after being turned on. Waste of money.,2021,06
"Sleek,  nice and holds charge for a long time.  Definitely recommend.",2021,06
Love it!,2021,06
"Easy, light, inexpensive , quiet and perfect for my new Mac laptop !!",2021,06
"I read the reviews and ordered two.  One for home, one for office.  They both worked great for about 2.5 weeks.  I started having trouble with the charge not lasting.  And then by the time my return window expired, they were both worthless.  I can still plug in and the lights are pretty, perhaps a very weak night light?  That is what the star is for, the pretty lights.",2021,06
"When I received this item it was thin, which is okay but it was also chipped off on the left side. Then, I simple drop and the mouse damn near shattered! And to stop it off, sometimes the cursor goes everywhere, which can be annoying when you’re working on particular items. I love it for the lights and how compact it is. Handle this item with care!",2021,06
"I actually really love this mouse, its slim and quiet.  The multicolored led lights stopped working after 4 days, but it does not affect the quality of it..just a bummer they dont work anymore.",2021,06
"Low profile, feels good in the hand, responsive",2021,06
Constantly had to charge. Cool light effects came at a cost. I ended up going to target and buying a $5 one that works much better and is battery operated.,2021,06
Looks great. Comfortable in my hand,2021,06
Didnt last long,2021,06
"Mouse works, LGB died almost immediately. The only color actively working on this mouse is the red led and the blue when charging. When the mouse is left idle for a minute or two, it seems to desync and takes a minute to ""wake up"". It gets in the way more often than not. Otherwise, okay product.",2021,06
The USB broke off in my computer and I had trouble removing it. I finally got it out with finger nail clippers. I was happy with it until this happened.,2021,06
"The usb charging port was bent & I had to bend back before I could even plug it in to use.  Amazon needs to start labeling the country of origin, I don’t want to support a country that suppresses its people & destroyed a democracy in Hong Kong.  Made in China 🇨🇳 junk.",2021,06
"At first I loved this mouse, it worked great and the battery lasted a long time. But I have bought 2 of these now, and the first one was faulty and this second one has only worked for about 2 months  and now will not connect! This product would be fantastic if it  worked longer that 2 months. But for the price, it's not terrible.",2021,06
"....and differently from the Alienware, I saved about 90 dollars.Love the fact you can switch the LEDs off to save battery, also good battery is rechargeable (although in about 3 weeks I never had to charge it yet) good quality and fun to use.Also awfully cheap, which is always a plus!Not sure if is a good match for gaming, I've used it in the new MS flight simulator and I must say the response was fine...Not sure though if it would be fast enough for the ""kill 'em all"" gamesTotally recommended.",2021,06
"Okay, here we go..  I was really excited to get this and try it out. I want to note that I wasn't expecting much since it is pretty inexpensive; however, my excitement didn't last long. The dpi will not change on the one I got, so I changed my mouse settings on my PC. This very, VERY minimally helped. -I couldn't help but laugh while doing this because that curser is sliiiiiiiic......ccccck!For some, this may fit comfortably in their hand, but not mine. Also, it goes to ""sleep"" QUICKLY - as in 5.6 seconds quick. Yes, I timed it.Unfortunately, I'll have to try to return this since I won't use it... ever. By ""try to return it,"" I mean try to actually remember to take it to the post office (or wherever I need to take it) because that never actually happens.In closing, if you have small hands, you're looking for a super slick (meaning super fast) mouse that you may or may not be able to change the dpi, you'll only use it once... maybe twice a year, and you're good at taking your returns where they need to go to get returned, then go for it! Otherwise, maybe look into a different one. Also, I gave 2 stars since is was inexpensive.",2021,06
This was a great mouse for schoolwork and better then using a battery mouse,2021,06
I really like this mouse. Super easy to connect and the charge lasts forever. I swear I charge it once every 1.5 weeks and I leave it on by accident all the time but the sleep mode is great. I recommend!,2021,06
I honestly got this product not so long ago and I can’t really speak about the durability but I wasn’t disappointed with my purchase. The battery last for a very long time and the light it just beautiful.,2021,06
Works excellent. I prefer this mouse over the apple one.,2021,06
"Perfect! Just what I needed. Love that I can use with my Mac and PC. Mouse is smooth, fast, and accurate.",2021,06
" Pretty and sleek. I just opened it, says to charge for 2 hours with USB cable in box.... Umm what cable? Luckily I have plenty of chargers so once I use it, I shall update review.Update, works as it should, love the color changing. No complaint.",2021,06
Works very well. Best part is charging the mouse through power chord rather than batteries.,2021,06
"Garbage, bought my niece a new HP for college, plugging the usb in laptop mouse cause the laptop not to work, mouse moves really slow or don’t move at all, thinking it was the laptop, took the laptop back got a brand new one same issue, but when I took the Ian out and used my store bough (Best Buy) mouse works perfect no problems. Be careful with this mouse and plugging it into your laptops.",2021,06
"Cord gets super hot when trying to charge using my lap top, and not charging",2021,06
Mouse wheel is already squeaking when rolled after barely 3 months of use.,2021,06
"For work , kids love the colors",2021,06
Excellent thin size. I prefer this new wireless for its thinness and rechargeability.,2021,06
"Battery dies very quickly. Not impressed. Sellers keep harassing me to delete my review! No way, scammers!Buy the below mouse instead. It works great!WisFox 2.4G Wireless Mouse for Laptop, Ergonomic ... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y1KKFBH/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_api_glt_fabc_4GP5QM8PZ805Q7RQZ7QW?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1",2021,06
Center scroll wheel click functionality very spotty after 4 mo of use. Now wheel won’t scroll at all. Disappointing.,2021,06
"I love the feel of this mouse. It is comfortable, easy to set up, rechargeable, wireless and the lights are so pretty! Fast shipping and quality packaging. Would highly recommend.",2021,06
"Love it, great value",2021,06
"I don't use it for gaming that's why I give it three stars for that, haven't used sleep mode and don't plan on it so I gave it three stars not using that either. The three stars for ergonomics is accurate because it could be a little bit taller and we both have tiny hands, will be small for someone with large hands for sure. The colors are nice, Price is Right oh, and we like how it changes colors. I would buy again, adapter that comes with are very convenient, and worth the money I paid just for the adapters.",2021,06
Functional mouse but it is hard to click with fingers - extra effort needed which is not good.  I probably won’t buy this again.,2021,06
excelente,2021,06
"Fun mouse for my office! I enjoy it and it’s fun to watch the colors change. A coworker liked it also an plans to purchase one also. I sent her the information. Highly recommend, thank you.",2021,06
This mouse is awesome. The lights are fun and I have owned it 2 weeks and only charged it once and I use it daily,2021,06
Inexpensive!! Love the changing of colored lights,2021,06
"I really liked this mouse, but the battery runs out every few days. I wish the lights would automatically turn off after not being used for a few minutes.",2021,06
"Great product so far. Cool lights. Also, not battery operated, charged with usb cord.",2021,06
Good mouse for the price and the buttons do not make noise so it feels nice when clicking which is a win for me,2021,06
Yes,2021,06
It is super comfy and I love the lights around it. Small enough for my hands.Highly recommend this mouse.,2021,06
Good mouse.  Holds good charge. Perfect for gaming.,2021,06
I really needed a mouse because it is so much easier when working from my laptop. I searched on Amazon and came across this vibrant mouse. I fell in love and decided to buy it. It was the best decision because this mouse is fantastic and works perfectly. I love the color variations and the sleek look. It is easy to setup/use and also easy to charge. It is also wireless which makes it even better.,2021,06
PRODUCT IS EXTREMLY CHEAP. LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM FIVE BELOW OR WISH. YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH IT AND IT DIES REALLY FAST. IM SAD I MISSED THE RETURN WINDOW BUT I WILL BE BUYING A NEW PRODUCT,2021,06
"This mouse is light and fits in my hand well.  It's fun to watch the colors slowly change.  However, it does not stayed charged long at all and cannot be used while it is charging.",2021,06
Works great charges fast with cool lighting,2021,06
Mouse is really good for the price. smooth and easy to use. Also the RBG lighting looks perfect with my setup!,2021,06
"A well-engineered mouse with long battery life, good design, and cutting-edge wireless connectivity. Very easy to set up and use. Recommended!",2021,06
"This is a very good, sleek and easy to use mouse, I really like the colored lights, the charge lasts a long time. I have no cons and I would buy again. I use this wireless mouse with my Dell 5490 All In One.",2021,06
I use a laptop everyday at work and this was a life saver. Very comfortable reliable wireless mouse.,2021,06
Love this mouse and it stays charged for quite awhile,2021,06
"I bought this because of the lights and it looked cool, but it does not have a battery.  It needs to be plugged in to charge.  Unless you babysit it by always turning it off when you are done using it, the charge dies after 2 days and then you have a dead mouse, or one that is now 'wired' as it charges.  Too high maintenance for a mouse.",2021,06
I liked using this mouse but it needed charged a lot more than anticipated. It looks good and worked good but overall was a little too cheaply made and it didn’t last long. It fell (thanks to my small children) and cracked right open. I only got to use it a couple of months.,2021,06
"Very nice smooth feel, fun LED shifting color. Love the silent click feature.",2021,06
"Replaced my boring mouse with this one, wanted something rgb and rechargeable. Love it so far!!!",2021,06
Bought this for work and three hours after turning it on the mouse wheel broke and became unusable.,2021,06
"EASY TO USE! It took less than 30 second to install. It comes with a C charger connecter I didn't need to use it. Take the piece from under the mouse and put it directly in the computer, turn mouse on and use. Real comfortable to my hand, sleek, bright colors,and just a cool accessory to my workspace.",2021,06
I love the light weight fee to this mouse. But unfortunately it doesn’t hold a charge to be able to use it.,2021,06
Works well easy to use stays charged for a long time. Connects easily definitely a good buy for the price,2021,06
I love how the mouse changed colors and the set up was easy just plug and go. The charging was easy as well,2021,06
I purchased this mouse because I needed a new one for my work from home station. I came across this mouse and read some of the reviews and thought I would take a chance on it. It has turned out to be one of the best things I have purchased from Amazon! It is such a smooth operating mouse and the color displays on it are really fun! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in search of a wireless mouse.!,2021,06
The mouse was surprisingly lightweight. I am accustomed to the wireless mice that are battery powered and it makes a huge difference. It is super sensitive too. I was able to use it on fabric and on wood directly without issue. My old mouse required a mouse pad. The lights can be left on or turned off but you still see the red glow of the sensor when lights are turned off. The USB receiver was easily found underneath. It was a bit difficult to pull out but using my nails it came out pretty quick. It also comes with the USB c adapter which you don't see often but I believe it would work with a Chromebook? or maybe with a USB c charger? It has everything I need and it is crazy how lightweight this thing is!,2021,06
"I really like this mouse, I just wish I had a way to know what the battery was at or when it is getting low.",2021,06
The shape is great and the charge really last. unfortunately after 3 months of use the USB connector has stopped working and the USB charger does not connect to the computer it only charges,2021,06
exactly what i thought it was gonna be! i use this at work and although the sleep mode can be annoying it does it’s job!,2021,06
Liked the sleek design and that it lights up ☺️,2021,06
That it is rechargeable and slim and good buttons make it super,2021,06
Super cute and so easy to use! I love that it’s so slim too!,2021,06
"First, I removed  the charging cable from the box and found that the wire was broken and I figured I could find another cable but then I pulled out the mouse and it was broken as well. The top half of the mouse was broken off from the bottom half. Needless to say I returned the product for a refund.",2021,06
"Good enough for the price, but very awkward to handle. Middle mouse button is hard to push and often doesn't actually get pushed despite making the sound.",2021,06
"Worked right out of the packaging, cute, inexpensive",2021,06
"I recently picked up a new computer and needed a new mouse - one that would fit the bill for my work editing video. It needed to be light, ergonomic and move well with sensitivity. I also work in low light and the LED light on the mouse is a nice touch. The LED is certainly not an essential feature, but it definitely adds a nice look to the product, and for me is very appealing. This mouse has been great all around. I recommend this product.Edit: Initially I loved this mouse, however its ability to maintain a charge dramatically decreased in short order. It can no longer keep a charge for more than an hour or so. The mouse has essentially become useless. This is quite a disappointment after initially enjoying the other qualities of this mouse.",2021,06
"This mouse works like a charm, it is beautiful. The changing colors are fantastically fun!  This fits nicely in my backpack for use with my laptop.",2021,06
I had my mouse for about a week and after using it maybe 5 times. It completely stopped moving around. Only things that works on it is the buttons and the wheel,2021,06
"Awesome and cool, the color turns red when it's time to plug in and recharge.",2021,05
"I love how you don't need a battery , just recharge it! Great and colorfull!",2021,05
Great wireless mouse.  The instructions were easy to follow.  The only thing I wish it did was glow red when it needs recharging.  I will probably purchase another one when this one dies.,2021,05
Love how it looks and feels but out the box it was really glitchy. I charged it and saw that it was still sticking a bit as I was using it. Since it's a mouse the one thing it should do is move smoothly ya know? I don't know if this was just this one mouse or it's how it runs. Either way it's really annoying when you're trying to get things done.,2021,05
"I was looking to buy a portable mouse for travel, and was going to buy a regular battery one but saw this pop up as an option. I really like the mint green color. It’s affordable, easy to use, connects fast, and very low profile. The clicker is quiet too. Scroller works great as well. I charged it up connected via USB to my dock station and it was ready to go. Love it.",2021,05
Used for daily use. Nice product,2021,05
The mouse is light weight and I like the colors. It is also smooth and charge lasts for a while. However I just bought it in May and today in August the usb broke off in the usb port of my computer. The metal part detached from the plastic part. Disappointed.,2021,05
So I bought this a few days ago and the first day of using it which was yesterday (6/8/21) the color changing lights worked and now (6/9/21) only the red light works. This is bs!!! I turned it off for 40 mins to give it a rest but nope the lights still don’t work 2/10 don’t recommend,2021,05
"Very glitch-y.  Curser tracking is not smooth at all.  Silent buttons are almost too sensitive and frequently ""click"" when I'm not meaning to do so.I threw out this item after only 3 days.",2021,05
"Gorgeous and very affordable. The battery doesn't last very long, but it's easy to charge while using.",2021,05
"I was so happy with this mouse when I first got it. Very comfortable, loved the light and most of all the wireless feature. The love affair however was short-lived. After using the mouse for only 2 months it stopped working. I would charge it, it would run for 5 minutes then dead again. It got to the point that the only way the mouse would work is if I kept it plugged - therefore defeating the wireless feature.",2021,05
"Love the design. After two weeks, it has started to fail again (this is my 2nd one). Hoping it's just a fluke!",2021,05
"This mouse was purchased for use with my laptop. I've purchased two of the same brand previously, but wanted something different so I took a chance on this unknown. The mouse is light, and ergonomic - I have a fairly small hand and it fits well. Connection was simple. The sleep mode will definitely increase battery life. Add to this the pretty lights, and lovely rose color...I'm pleasantly surprised! I would recommend this mouse to anyone who wants an inexpensive, and uncomplicated, addition to their setup.",2021,05
Size is just right for me,2021,05
"I like that it recharges and doesn't require batteries.  It doesn't last that long though.  but seems to recharge good enough after only being plugged in for even 5 minutes.  I wish it came with a longer charge cord since you could then use also with charging cable plugged in  ( still can, but very short cord)",2021,05
No batteries needed. This works great and it lites up too. Easy to charge and use. No problems at all.,2021,05
"I bought this mouse in february 2021, it uit working and you relpaced it. Now the new one quit.",2021,05
"Works great, no issues",2021,05
This mouse doesn't work. It either isn't holding a charge or it just isn't connecting to it's own bluetooth.,2021,05
Love that its rechargeable!! Purchased for work computer functions exactly as desired.,2021,05
"Regardless of where you plan to use this product, home, school, or work, you can’t go wrong with this product. It’s a quality product at a great price. I’ve had mine less than a week now, and I just ordered another one.  Add a little light in your life. 😉",2021,05
"The product fits well in my hand and has a quiet click but it keeps on cutting out. I will walk away for a minute and the mouse does not work anymore so I have to unplug it, turn it off, then back on and replug it in.",2021,05
I travel for work so this wireless mouse is perfect. It’s small for packing away and the sleep mode keeps it going longer. I charge it about every 2-3 days.,2021,05
Another lowest bidder production,2021,05
Amazing little mouse,2021,05
"Like it very much! Great price, great performance and cute too!",2021,05
Great item and came so quick. Thank you :),2021,05
Ready to handle,2021,05
Fun little mouse. Doesn’t feel overly sturdy but cute. Lites are fun.,2021,05
"Small, rechargeable and works perfectly.",2021,05
It works great! I love it! My son uses it aswell for roblox,2021,05
"The color wasn’t like the photo. It’s a bit darker than what I was expecting (see photo for reference). I did love that the mouse came with a USB to USB-C adapter. The part that connects to the computer for wireless capabilities was “stuck” so I had to use excessive force to remove it. Only other thing I could change is the LED colors. It goes through series of colors, but it would be fun to be able to choose what color it could be.",2021,05
 I love the fact that this thing is quiet as a mouse(Lol).  I hate the clicking sound on other mouses.  The other thing I love is that it's rechargeable! No batteries.  The only con I could find is that it is not an ergonomic mouse.  That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars.,2021,05
IT TAKES AS MUCH TIME TO CHARGE THE MOUSE AS TO USE IT.  NOT PRACTICAL.  OTHERWISE THE MOUSE WORKSand it is  ERGONOMICAL,2021,05
Stopped working after 2 months. What a waste.,2021,05
"The mouse is comfortable to move. It goes to sleep while in a Zoom/Teams call, however easily wakes up with one click.",2021,05
 Love it plug in and go works on my work computer with no problem will purchase from them again,2021,05
"Quite, cute and very portable",2021,05
"I was looking for a mouse to replace my old wireless one with which the scroll wheel wasnt working anymore and found this one.  I am pleasantly surprised by this mouse.  The click is very quiet yet there is a satisfying tactile feel to it, though the right click can be a bit sensitive but nothing too major. I think the best feature of this mouse is that it is rechargeable.  Very convenient.  The mouse can be used while charging and only took about 1.5 hours to fully charge.  There is a led indicator that turns off to show when the mouse is done charging.  The mouse will also go into sleep mode after 10 minutes of inactivity to save power.  Overall, great mouse.",2021,05
"I researched Amazon for a wireless mouse and found this one.  I bought it to use with a new laptop.  It works great.  It is responsive, easy to use and saves me time tinkering with the laptops built in mouse.  Another plus is no more batteries to buy.  Happy to have this.",2021,05
" It's not working after setting up to my laptop , but the colors do show up.... I tried to take out the USB and plugging it back again but it doesn't seem to work.",2021,05
Slim and fits comfortably in palm of hand.  I wish that I would have purchased sooner!,2021,05
My son loves it but the instructions are very scary.,2021,05
"Great mouse overall. Very light weight and soundless. LED lights on the mouse work well, too.",2021,05
Colorful,2021,05
Doesn’t stay charged long enough for me.,2021,05
"Beautiful but not sturdy. It comes with a warning ""do not drop"" , well I dropped it...twice! Ugh. It totally won't work now.  I just bought the darn thing less than 2 months ago (passed the return window, of course). Blame me if you want, but it shouldn't be that easy to break!",2021,05
Works great but I don’t like the lights going on when I turn came computer on but does not go off when shutting down,2021,05
"It was fine to use at first, but it stopped working after about a month of using it consistently. Not impressed with longevity.",2021,05
"Great mouse, setup was a breeze, cool rgb changing colors. Long lasting battery!",2021,05
"I really liked this small mouse for my laptop. It worked fairly well, but the tracking wheel soon  developed a squeak that rendered it unusable.",2021,05
It’s really nice and cute mouse. So light and handy.The charging battery it’s really useful,2021,05
The clicks are nice and quiet. The lights are pretty. The battery lasts a long time. It's very simple plug and play.,2021,05
"Nice and light, slight hesitation on click.",2021,05
Product is responsive. The colors are cool. Easy to recharge. So far pleased with purchase. Using for work and not gaming.,2021,05
"Tried on multiple surface and no matter what i do, the pointer is erratic.  It also NEVER goes into sleep mode.  If you fail to turn it off, you will run through the battery in a day.  Awful.  Tried to click on the seller name in an effort to contact them directly, but it was grayed out.  Very disappointed.",2021,05
As the title suggest it stopped working after a week of use. I really liked the feel and look of the mouse so I was pretty happy with it until today when it stopped working. Do not recommend.,2021,05
It's cool and colorful! I love it!!,2021,05
Very nice! I bought 2 love it!,2021,05
"Smooth, wakes with a click and best of all no batteries.  Holds charge all day with constant use",2021,05
This mouse does seem to let you pick a color and the same is not comfortable.,2021,05
This mouse is quite comfortable and silent. Recommended! :),2021,05
This is the second time i purchase this mouse in a matter of a few months and the second one is already not working at all i charged it and all and nothing. I have the rose gold one.Can you guys please send a new one or refund me ? I like the color matches my laptop well but i refuse to keep re purchasing every other few months.,2021,05
I liked the design of this product but after two weeks it stopped working.  I kept having to turn it on and off to get it to track at all.  Disappointed.,2021,05
DOES NOT WORK AT ALL AND WILL NOT CONNECT TO LAPTOP. dont waste your money,2021,05
"I love this mouse, it's so silent and smooth to the touch.",2021,05
The cursor skips all over the place; you have no idea what you're clicking. This mouse is now in my garbage.Buy a different mouse.,2021,05
purchased this March 29th 2021 only lasted 2 months.Was great while it worked but then 2 days ago it just stopped working.I thought I somehow plugged it in wrong and it didn't charge so charged it back up for two days.Went to use it today and after 30 min it stopped working again. I only use this for work. It doesn't get tossed around in a backpack or anything it just sits on my desk and is used 8 hrs a day 5 days a week and is plugged back in at the end of the work day and died in 2 months.,2021,05
"Very cheaply made. It was the biggest waste of my money. The piece that plugs into the USB port broke in a weeks time as I was taking it out of the port. It can be glued back together but it would have to be done with precision and carefulness not to get glue all over it. I dont know that its worth it. I guess this is one of those things that its just better off going with the brand you trust and paying that little bit extra for something you know is not going to come apart because it was poorly constructed.It was pretty cool how it lights up. It is very lightweight as well, which I will leave that to your own interpretation.",2021,05
I use it plugged in as the battery life is ok but not amazing... but does what it’s supposed to do.. great addition to my workspace and very comfortable on the hand,2021,05
I like the fact that it's micro USB instead of swapping AAA battery and it's very light weight and soft and easy to use,2021,05
Very satisfying to use and look at but after a couple months the scroll wheel started being super rough and squeaky. Good value though.,2021,05
Very happy and true to its description.,2021,05
WORTH OF PURCHASE !!!,2021,05
Great product and very happy with my purchase. Quiet buttons when pressed and love the different color lights.,2021,05
"Product worked great for 1st 3 months, now the USB charging port is bad and since it's a rechargable mouse it's useless now. Led lights were cool and the mouse felt great ergonomically with soft quiet clicks. Being optical vs laser, it isn't for gaming and battery wouldn't last all day clicking. It also went into sleep mode too quickly and having to click without knowing where the arrow to turn it on turned into a hassle.",2021,05
"easy to use, lightweight and comfortable to the hand...",2021,05
Easy to use with a sleek design.,2021,05
It’s been about 5 months since I bought this. The piece that goes into your laptop to make it wireless completely fell apart and mouse no longer clicks. 10/10 would NOT recommend,2021,05
"Extremely comfortable, works great, looks gorgeous, and is rechargeable. Charges quickly and easily and the battery lasts a long time.",2021,05
The mouse is very cute and i love the colors and the way it lights up. I went to use it one day and it was out of charge (I charged it). I doubt this will last long. It was $15 but really worth about  $5.,2021,05
"Battery last forever!  I accidently left it on over the weekend and still didn't need to charge it until Tuesday.  it did take some getting used to the power save function, you need to click to wake it up.",2021,05
Satisfied,2021,05
I only had it for a week and it quit charging I even tried other charging ports it would not take a charge waste of my money,2021,05
This mouse was awful!! It worked for a few minutes and then stopped working. You’d have to turn it off and back on again for it to work for a minute. I changed the battery twice. Do not purchase.,2021,05
"I loved this product but, when I went to remove it from the usb slot, the inner part broke off inside the computer.",2021,05
"I have already ordered the black one and liked it so much, I orderer another one for my laptop!",2021,05
"The device looks and feels good.  The left clicker is very sensitive and mandates that under normal use you keep your hand off of the top of the mouse on the left side or you will accidently left click.  The coloring is good looking, but it is difficult to determine when you need to recharge.  the short charging cord connects to the computer, so you must leave the computer on while recharging the mouse, which is inconvenient.  but the control of the curser is good, although occasionally it seems to ""jump"" to a different place on the screen...still not sure why that happens.  But it is decent value for the money once you teach yourself it's ""quirks.""",2021,05
As described,2021,05
I read a lot of the reviews before I decide to buy this item.  So far I have no regrets. People complain about the mouse turning off and the lights being on.  So when I got the mouse noticed that there was an off button for the lights. If you think about it you are saving power when your not using it.  I would recommend the product.,2021,05
I got 4 of these and so far 2 have been returned. They work until they need charged and then they stop working.  Don't waste your money!,2021,05
good mouse,2021,05
No complaint!,2021,05
Actually changed my mind on this mouse. The one I was using was driving me crazy because the clicking was so loud. I broke this one out of the box and it's pretty cool. It changes colors and it's silent. I can work with the size being slimer.,2021,05
The cord going into for charging doesn’t fit exactly right. Seems cheaply made. Wouldn’t buy this brand again.,2021,05
Broke within a week. It’s cute and all but not worth it.,2021,05
"Perfect mouse, silently working",2021,05
Cable quit charging mouse after one charge!,2021,05
It charged up the first time and didn’t charge up again after that. And the replacement batteries for it cost more than the mouse itself. Very cool looking tho.,2021,05
I've had this mouse for almost 2 weeks now and and loved it until just yesterday the scroll wheel developed a loud grinding a popping sound every time you use it. I will definitely be sending this junk back and get something else.,2021,05
"This is the first mouse I have bought for my new PC, probably the best purchase I have made for my PC. It's great to use anywhere, it's so quiet and smooth looking, It fits in the palm of my hand nicely, the colors are a bit off but great for how cheap it was! I really like that It was cheap too, but it wasn't cheaply made or seemed like it. I 9/10 recommend! It was a bit trickcy to figure out how to connect it to my PC, I do have both USBC and USB on here but keep in mind that if you have a USB PC you will have to take out the connecter in the mouse, its hard to get it out of though! DO SAVE THE BOX FOR THE USBC CONNECTOR AND CHARGER!",2021,05
works well,2021,05
I like the compact shape and the changing light bar around it.,2021,05
I really love this mouse. I bought it for my office to get rid of the cords. The colors are nice and I like that it goes to sleep when not in use. I've gotten many compliments on it.,2021,05
Looks & feels great! Love all the colors!,2021,05
"I really like the feel and look of this mouse. I love the matte feel, and the lights. Its also very quiet and not clicky, I wasn't expecting that for the price!The only issue I have is that if you use it with a laptop and remove the receiver often, the receiver will come apart. Im not techy enough to figure out how to make it stay together (with glue??, idk) whenever I take it out, the USB drive and the black part separate, and its hard to take the drive out of my computer when that happens. Frustrating. Will say that it lasted a couple months before that happened though.. if you use it with a pc and never remove it,, itll last longer.. i just wish I could get a replacement receiver; I don't want to throw the mouse away if the receiver is the only issue with it. I got it in February 2021 and I noticed that it glitches a bit if its not on a mouse pad or about to die, which can be annoying but manageable;the mouse charges very quickly!",2021,05
"I really like this item, it is a lot better than the other ones I was using, great for gaming, charges quickly and easy to get started with and It fits my small hand perfectly. Would definitely recommend this product.",2021,05
"I absolutely love this mouse! Super handy dandy because not only does it work with my Mac it also works with my work laptop which is a dell. The only thing I don’t like about it is that if you don’t use it for a while, it shuts off. I mean it’s great because it saves energy so you don’t have to charge it often but meh. I’ve yet to charge it again. I used it for 2 days for at least 10 hours each day.",2021,05
Clicking the right and left stick and it's is slow to catch click. Cheap yes but as they say you get what you pay for. Cute yes.. but not worth the frustration.,2021,05
The mouse worked fine for the few minutes i got to use it. The USB charging cord was missing. Per the instructions you cannot use any other charging cord with it.,2021,05
"This is the best wireless mouse I've ever used.  The flat profile keeps my arthritic hand from getting stiff and sore after long use.  The colors are subtle enough to be fun but not intrusive.  If you plan to use it with a desktop computer, be aware that the charging cord is very short, so using the mouse while charging may be a problem.  I use it with a laptop, where this is not an obstacle.  The mouse appears very well made and sturdy.",2021,05
"Works good for a child, not  for people with arthritis",2021,05
Very cool design thanks,2022,05
"It's light and the texture is nice but there are a few flaws. The mouse can tilt forward lifting the back off the table since there's a lot of surface area past where it touches the surface of the table. The mouse is small, which is nice for portability, but for my hand size it gets uncomfortable after a while. The battery charge is good and the lights aren't too harsh. But by far the most annoying flaw is that it doesn't maintain a constant mouse button press. So if you have to hold and drag something, it will just randomly unclick even though you still have the button pressed. I tested this a lot and it always, without fail stops holding down on the computer. This is unplayable for some games where you have to hold down one of your mouse buttons. Perhaps I just received a faulty mouse, but for the price it's hard to complain too much.",2021,05
Absolutely amazing product! I cant get use it enough especially with the color light feature. The scroll bar is very smooth and the mouse itself fits perfectly in your hand. Not to mention there is no batteries required since it it rechargeable. Definitely worth a 5 star rating.,2021,05
👌 and on time,2021,05
THIS THING IS SO SMOOTH AND SO AWESOME! Highly recommend!,2021,05
"First the price is very affordable, it’s light weight and it works very well. The perfect part is it doesn’t make any sound. Love the product. I am very satisfied",2021,05
"This mouse is ergonomic, light weight, and very easy to use. Unfortunately the color shown in the picture for rose gold was not very accurate, it is much darker. I would still buy it again though.",2021,05
"I bought this for my daughter and initially she said she loved it.  Then, she stopped using it and went back to her old mouse.  I left my mouse at work and borrowed this one.  Now I know why she doesn’t use it.  It constantly disconnects and I have to turn it on and off to get it to work.  Then, it randomly tracks on the screen when I am not moving it...it seems like someone else is controlling my computer.  Unsettling.  This mouse is junk...very pretty junk.",2021,05
 This is so cute. I love how it changes colors. It is small but not too small.,2021,05
This was such a great buy. Way better than my microsoft mouse. I'm soooo happy I bought this. The light features are really nifty. I haven't really touched it but I'm just so impressed with now smooth it works on surfaces and on the computer. I'm in love,2021,05
Works good for a laptop,2021,05
Love how lightweight it is. Just a light tap to right and left click. Mouse tracks greats and the led lights are cute plus it’s pink and priced super! I brought this one for my work PC and I’m buying a second one for my MacBook ...  💕,2021,05
Perfect fit to my hand and matches my headphones!!,2021,05
"We bought this as a replacement for our son, for school work. He had the old version and it worked really well, but he dropped it one to many times and broke (lasted @ 1yr).  This one @a couple weeks into school work the cursor started to drift for no reason. My son is in the 5th grade, no drops, tried several differ backgrounds. Nothing worked, so my husband tried out the mouse, still does not work. Not upgraded, waisted our money and frustrated the whole house withe the uncontrollable drift.",2021,05
Did not receive the correct cable to charge.,2021,05
"Started out pretty nice but after 3.5 weeks the mouse no longer tracks properly. Even after charging all night, after about 3 minutes of use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements.Update: The vendor keeps sending me emails asking me to delete this review for $30- I'm guessing they don't want me to write this on the review but I've told them no three times now and they just sent another one.  I've told them that it's unethical. I've told them its completely against the spirit of reviews in the first place. And there's another one in my inbox. *sigh* I guess I just forward another one to the Customer Service Department of AMazon.",2021,05
It is just ok product for me. It could be more finished product but its not. Sometime it seems like its not clicking at all. Lights are good but for performance i give it three stars.,2021,05
"Very good, come back if need to",2021,05
This mouse is amazing its super quiet when clicking and it runs smooth even on bed sheets. It works on any surface!,2021,05
Perfect low profile for me. Not sure how long the charge will last with the LED's on but you can switch them off.For the price nothing to complain about. Thanks,2021,05
Charged this for 2 hrs like instructed and could not get the mouse to work. Extremely disappointed and returning.,2021,05
The sleekness of it and the colors. Loved it for work.,2021,05
It only lasted  3 days. Is not worth returning it.,2021,05
Very nice Mouse. Well designed and nice colors. Functioning well.I am satisfied with it.,2021,05
I am pleasantly pleased with this mouse. It’s attractive looking and works very well. It comes with a USB C adapter along with the charging cable in case you need one. Plug and play actually worked. No complaints about this mouse and would purchase again if I need an additional one.,2021,05
This mouse works well for my needs and fits in my (medium-sized) hands well. This is the first mouse I've ever owned with a built-in rechargeable battery and now I don't ever want to own one without it. The small form factor is also nice for packing up and taking on the go. Another nicely designed element is that the nano-receiver tucks into the bottom of the mouse and doesn't require prying off a cover or any extra effort to remove or insert.,2021,05
"I love this color-changing wireless mouse!! I’m a colorful person, so I recognize colors before recognizing plain black and white. As an educator, my office is colorful, and my classroom was colorful too!! LOVE IT!!!!",2021,05
I love this mouse. It’s VERY smooth. If I had one complaint it would be that it will be dead in the morning if you don’t plug it up before you leave work. But sometimes I just forget to plug it up when I leave so that’s my fault.,2021,05
Good mouse. Started has a silent click. But has gotten louder. It works great other than that.,2021,05
I an very unhappy with this products.  Uses less than a year the wire on usb adapter is broke and the mouse no longer work  Not happy at all  Can I send back so you can look at it?,2021,05
Stopped working after a couple of weeks.,2021,05
Works perfect. Connects easy. Long rechargeable battery,2021,05
"I have been using this mouse for about a month, it had been working perfectly. I only use it occassionally throughout the day. After about a month it stopped working while it was on the color changing mode. It still works while on the regular red light mode, but now not the color changing mode.",2021,05
"Bought for my 6th grader to use in school with her laptop on a daily basis.  She’s used this for quite sometime now with no issues, and she’s very rough on her things.",2021,05
Great product!! Would highly recommend!,2021,05
"I gave it two stars because I like glowing lights (can you tell I’m a child of the 80s?); if I could give it zero stars for function, I would. This mouse has a lot of good reviews - maybe mine is a fluke. It is, however, fairly horrible. The charge on the battery is extraordinarily short-lived and when charged, it sort of sucks then too.",2021,05
"Really disappointed with this product. I loved it when I got it. It fit my hand nicely worked like a dream, then it came time to charge it. No matter where I plugged it in I could not get it to charge. Not sure if it is just a faulty product or if this is just how they are.",2021,05
"mouse is tiny in my hand, scroll wheel broke within the first week, USB plug is terrible..the worst ive ever had to deal with. Upon trying to remove the wireless USB plug from any any the top half come out but the metal part stays stuck in the plug, this has happened repeatedlyI just bought a different mouse",2021,05
Love it for my work from home job very ergonomic and smooth.,2021,05
The charging cord was very flimsy and won’t charge any more. Lasted about a week.,2021,05
Ergonomic and nice,2021,05
"Originally liked the idea of not having to use batteries. Tried using this mouse for about a week. When finished using it, I forgot to plug it in. So the next time I tried to use it, the power was zapped. That pretty much defeats the purpose of having a cordless mouse. With no power, had to use it when plugged into my laptop. Sent it back and got a mouse that requires on battery.",2021,05
Works great,2021,05
"It's an ultra slim design, power saving and easy to use. Ergonomic design, high precision and silent click.",2021,05
Wasn't terrible but I prefer gaming mice with at least the two buttons on the side,2021,05
 Love it,2021,05
Warning....it interferes with other USB devices plugged in to same computer.,2021,05
The last two we bought stopped working within 6 months.,2021,05
Mouse is a great bargain does everything it should do,2021,05
"The reliable range is less than 18 inches.  At 4 feet, you usually have  to click repeatedly.  Control of the moving arrow was sporadic.  I thought something was wrong with my computer until I bought a new mouse, which works fine.",2021,05
"Its nice not having to buy batteries all the time for my mouse. Only downside is when I don't move the mouse for a while, you have to click the button to wake it up, sometimes it clicks on the screen and clicks on something I didn't want to click on or open.Update: it died 3 months later. Not worth it.",2021,05
The mouse lasted one day. I changed the battery. It still wont turn on. URRGGGG!,2021,05
"Mouse is pretty solid all around. Except..About a day after I started using it the wheel started squeaking, figure it might go away in time. Nope.. 2 months later still squeaking and getting more irritating by the day. Working in an quiet office it is loud enough that other people can hear it.",2021,05
"This mouse was great when it's working. I work from home and use my mouse frequently. I have to charge it once a day. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be normal, but my last wireless mouse did not need this much charging.",2021,05
"Silent clicks, works great. Takes getting used to lower profile.Not having to worry about battery is golden.",2021,05
"Looks cool, doesn't last.",2021,05
"This mouse is a perfect companion for my Microsoft SurfacePro 6. I use this mouse for casual browsing as well as digital artwork and photo editing. The mouse feels nice and works well, especially for the price. I also love the option to have the RGB color mode on or off during use. Perfect little mouse for everyday use!",2021,05
Battery life is so short it might as well be a wired mouse.  It charges with as USB cable. Dropped once and had to be glued back together.,2021,05
"Like: design, look, feel, soft touch/silent 'click', sleep feature (single click to wake it up)Dislike: it loses the charge a bit quicker than I'd prefer but works wellEdited from original review --  would recommend",2021,05
I love the fact that there are no batteries.  Just charge and go.,2021,05
Prettiest mouse I've ever had.,2021,05
"I have had this mouse for two weeks.  For the first few days it worked great.  Nothing has changed with my work setup, fresh batteries, clean underside with mouse pad and it continues to lag.  Disappointed in the product.",2021,05
"I was naive and thought ""wireless"" meant ""bluetooth"", but it doesn't. Make sure you read everything carefully! The colours change really smoothly, though.",2021,05
Easy to use. I have a mouse pad and moves pretty good over it and perfect fit in my hands. The quality of the product is good. The size is good fit to carry in hand or with laptop bag.,2021,05
"This mouse is just right to fit my hand. Light weight , w/ pretty lights !",2021,05
"I love my new mouse! Really like the low profile and the colorful lights. It was totally plug and play, with no problem. Very pleased with my purchase.",2021,05
Great product. We use it mostly on our fire tablet and it works great!Only complaint is that there is not built in storage for the usb-c adapter.,2021,05
"I like this mouse, works very good, the dpi button do it work. Is very silent, and you can turn off the color light. Very recommended.",2021,05
I had a wireless mouse for over a year and found the it was very unstable and track even when not being moved. This one is solid as a rock.,2021,05
"I fully charged the mouse, used once and then it quit working. It will still light up but no mouse on the screen.",2021,05
"Will not charge/hold a charge, so doesn't work upon arrival. Don't waste your money, spend the extra and get something that functions.",2021,05
Only 2 months old and already won't charge  Pretty but not very long lasting,2021,05
I only used this month a handful of times...and after one month the roller on the mouse stopped working...and go figure...the seller only allows returns within the first month...attractive mouse but doesn't work long term...,2021,05
"8/30/2021- Wanted to update my review. Not only did this not last AT ALL I have received MULTIPLE emails from the distributor asking to remove my review, promising an amazon gift card. They gave multiple excuses of why the item doesn't work. Clearly from all the recent reviews of this item, they have not fixed any of it. I get almost daily emails from them asking to remove my review. DO NOT buy this item, you will regret it!I was loving this mouse. Sleek design. Loved the rechargeable feature of it. Until one day I came into work, booted up my laptop and the mouse was no longer connecting to the computer. Tried to take out the USB of the computer, and part of it was left stuck in the computer. I am now going to have to try to get the piece out of the usb port on my laptop. And how about that, my return window ended last week. VERY frustrated and annoyed by this. I would not recommend this item.",2021,05
The mouse does well. I use it daily for work. It lasts a long time between charges and puts itself to sleep when I am not using it so battery is not wasted. Sometimes I can go 2 weeks without charging. My only complaint is the wheel. I have had it about 4 months and the wheel started squeaking recently. People can hear it in my calls and it sometimes drives me nuts. This is my 3rd wireless mouse (the other 2 were different kinds and the wheel stopped working at all- was a common complaint on those).,2021,05
I really liked it for gaming,2021,05
"Love the slimline appearance and the changing colors. The colors add a sense of fun to a normally mundane piece of computer equipment. Also love the ability to keep it one color (red) or allow it to change colors and the ability to change the speed of the cursor. Good product, well designed. Make sure you are aware of the button on the bottom as it is not just an on/off switch, but has three positions. THIS IS NOW OCTOBER 2021, This mouse broke after little use while traveling. The scroll wheel broke inside the mouse making it useless. This appears to be a poor design and a weak point in this item and I would now not recommend it. I have had other computer mice for years without this issue.",2021,05
This product works great!!,2021,05
You can’t turn off the colors!!! It lights up the entire time you’re using it. I bought the white mouse of this brand and I love that one,2021,05
"There really isn’t anything to dislike about this mouse. The setup process is virtually non- existent, you just plug in the usb and you’re good to go. I have been using it for more than a week and I haven’t had to charge it yet. The light display is a neat added bonus, great for dark room adventures 😎. Long story short, it does what I expected, but better. Great buy.",2021,05
"So cute, great night light, long battery, no issues. Loveeeee it 😍Oh and it also pauses by itself when not in use which is cool",2021,05
Quiet click. Holds charge forever. Colors are a nice touch,2021,05
Not even a month and it’s broken,2021,05
"Beautiful lights, Quiet  and works well",2021,05
Tru,2021,05
I am just past the return window and of course this doesn’t work anymore.  I have barely used and haven’t had that long,2021,05
loved it. I love the colors.,2021,05
"I love this mouse it works well with my laptop. It changes colors with music, I wasn't expecting that but it is a bonus! It also changes color with the speakers I purchased, I defiantly would recommend this product.",2021,05
Love that this is so colorful. Works great with my mac,2021,05
"I’ve had this mouse for less than a month, and now it won’t work. I loved this mouse at the beginning. Never had a problem with it, and it was super cute. Now, it turns on and everything, and is also fully charged FYI, and it won’t move at all on my laptop. Just when I need it for a huge work project, and I can’t use it. Bummer.",2021,05
I love this mouse! Works and looks great for the price. Very comfortable and smooth operation. The charging cable that came with it didn't work though but I had another one so no biggie.,2021,05
"I’ve had this device for about 6 months. I brought 2 for my kids’ distance learning. No issues so far, I charge the device at least once a week",2021,05
Came with a big gash in it.,2021,05
Just got it today and started using it a few hours ago. So far so good I like it.,2021,05
Works great,2021,05
While the mouse was ok at the beginning it is now lagging after about 2 months of use. I've had to order a new mouse already to replace this one.,2021,05
Worked as soon as it was being used,2021,05
"I really was disappointed in this product, just needed an extra mouse for work andnit only worked for a few hours before the problems started.It wouldn't track where the mouse was and the lights worked but the mouse was useless other than the light show.Save your time and choose a mouse from a more reputable company",2021,05
"I actually loved the mouse my only issue was that the charger came and the USB part was a little off and would not fit. But other than that I love the mouse, it works great and easy to use!",2021,05
Outstanding customer service. Had a question and received an immediate response and resolution.. I love this mouse and would recommend it to others.,2021,05
"This is the first day of use, but the mouse looks nice, I got flat black, I like that there are no batteries. Charged quickly and super easy to start using. Its light and fits my small hand nicely. The lights are nice as well and not annoying. I like that they can be turned off. I don't plan on using the mouse for gaming so I will not know how well it works for that sort of thing.. for me just basic computer work, Photoshop & Lightroom and I think it will do nicely for those.. it seems quick and is working well even without a mouse pad. I think it was for sure worth the price so far. Its a nice basic mouse I think.",2021,05
This mouse is very quiet like it says in the description. Pretty. The only thing I worry about is it is very lightweight. The quality seems cheap. But it hasn’t proved that yet. I will only use it for office work so hopefully it will not wear out or go defective.,2021,05
Works right out of the box has the charging cable and both USB options so you can use it on different comps older and new. The lights are really cool too :),2021,05
Its really light weight and you don't hear the mouse clicks. However the usb blutooth is located at the bottom of the mouse.  I didn't have tough enough finger nails to pull the usb out.  Logitech has their blutooth in the mouse where the battery is located but this didn't have a visible battery.  So I used the tip of a knife to pop the usb out.  Almost nicked my hand from the blade getting the usb out.  You may do a better job than me.,2021,05
"There's really nothing to dislike about it, I love the fact that I don't have to run out and buy batteries every time it starts to act like it's not going to work. The way it charges is one of the main reasons that I bought it. I'd rather save the $$ for batteries and get something else instead of worrying if I have enough spare batteries. I have a mouse pad that has a ""breathing"" mode and the mouse goes along with its own pattern to make the two of them an excellent night light of sorts. For the amount spent, I'd give this mouse a 10+. I also love the fact that it's easy to pack it up with my laptop and go anywhere without worrying (again) if my mouse will run out of power. I think that there should be more accessories that can charge from a USB port rather than lugging around extra batteries.",2021,05
Great item kids love it,2021,05
It works nicely.,2021,05
Looks cool,2021,05
"This mouse is cute and convenient. Not heavy, the shiny black color looks nice against the colors and it is quiet. Works fine with my macbook air. The only thing is that the usb adaptor it comes with, is very hard to insert it into the c port that it comes. But besides that, everything works fine.",2021,04
"Used mouse for less than a week. It will not hold charge. Used for less than 2 hours this morning after charging for 24 hours and it’s now dead. But when it worked I loved it! It was light, quiet, and very colorful.",2021,04
"This is an awesome mouse!  It is a slender build so it fits a small hand & the lights are totally fun.  When you click the buttons, it is a strong click so that you know you have clicked on something, it, also, has a quick response on the computer.  It has an off & on switch plus an automatic shut off so you won't use up the batteries.  I will be buying one for my daughter, it is awesome.",2021,04
"I find this mouse easy to use, fits my hand very well (wear a medium sized glove) and moves fairly smoothly.  I say fairly smooth because I used a mouse pad with a smooth soft surface.  It seemed to drag just a little. When I tried a smooth hard surface it worked better.  You do have to click a button to ""wake up"" the mouse when it goes to sleep mode.  My other one woke up with just moving it.  I thought that maybe the changing lights around the mouse would be distracting but I dont even notice it.  I would probably buy again.",2021,04
My hand doesn't cramp using it. WIN!Update: Wheel in mouse won't scroll. Sadness,2021,04
Broke within a week,2021,04
I wanted it without the dongle,2021,04
"The mouse functions well, I especially like the colorful lights, however, the battery is kind of a pain. It lasts for only 1.5 days, even when it is in sleep mode. I have to remember to charge it everyday, which unfortunately I am not good at. I ended up using my old mouse as a backup every a few days.",2021,04
"Really disappointed. I wanted to love this product, but the USB-C adapter that came with it doesn’t fit into my USB-C port. It looks like it only goes half way in. So basically the product is useless :(The mouse itself was pretty and easy to manipulate. Wish the adapter worked",2021,04
My home schooling student enjoyed the lights but it has stopped working entirely after 4 months. Too late to return. So fun for awhile but don't expect it to last.,2021,04
"I love this mouse so much I bought another one. I love the soft click, that it is rechargeable, and the lights are great. Easy to install, just stick the USB dongle into the computer and Starr using. Probably the best mouse I’ve had.",2021,04
"Item must’ve been defective or something because in 2 was it stopped working, charging and pretty much would o my work at will.Also the returns process with this vendor sucks. It’s not via Amazon. Had to go twice to UPS because I had to print the label or pay $3.50 to print on site. Then had to also buy an envelope to ship it back in.If I would’ve paid a little bit more for a higher quality, would thane had to waste more time and money with the hassle. Save yourself the grief and get one a little bit more upscale.",2021,04
Didn't work.,2021,04
This is a great mouse especially for the price! It's quickly responsive even after sleep mode. Like the look of it too!,2021,04
Smooth clicking.  Ran out of battery quickly so shut it off when not in use.,2021,04
"Comfortable and sleek, great for traveling.  Love the colors running around it!",2021,04
I bought this for my new laptop because I really don't like the finger pads on laptops.It is truly plug-and-play and works awesome! plus it looks really sleek.,2021,04
Nice colorful LED mouse that is still tethered to a cord when in use for a while,2021,04
The wheel/roller makes click vibrations and makes scrolling take longer. I would love it otherwise.,2021,04
Stopped working a day and a half after I got it. I’ve charged it and everything and it just won’t work. Good for the couple of hours that I did use it I thought the lights were pretty. So I give it two stars for having pretty lights but no other stars because it was a waste of my money since it no longer works.,2021,04
Greatest,2021,04
Love the quietness and how light it is,2021,04
Won’t stay charged!,2021,04
"It's a pretty mouse! Just some notes.-Plastic a bit thin at the top so the color bleeds through more than the pic. It's fine, just an aesthetic thing.- mouse wheel a bit noisy now after some use. squeeks and screetches some when scrolling.-battery life is fine. .glad i can use it when charging .- sensitivity is off. cursor moves quickly randomly as if its spazzing out. thought this was a battery issue but it happens when fully charged sometimes.Overall it's fine but I shouldve just bought something a bit sturdier even if it was pricier. gonna keep using it to get my moneys worth!",2021,04
"This so slim not comfortable for men with average size hand, maybe children can use it.Not sure how this things got 5 star reviews, I believe most 5 star reviews are made by paid promoters.",2021,04
It works very good and the price is perfect.,2021,04
"It has to be charged more than a normal one, but love it otherwise",2021,04
The mouse is so fast and good!  Got the silver color and its so pretty especially at night. Easy set up,2021,04
I got this for my sister for her birthday to go with her new laptop and she absolutely loves it. Very easy to use and adorable,2021,04
"I love this, no more batteries, and I love how it lights up...",2021,04
This mouse is garbage. Buyer beware. Doesn't hold a charge. Doesn't move the cursor. Bought 2 for 2 separate computers and its the same for both. Amazon basics mouse is 1000% better,2021,04
Lightweight. Easy bluetooth connection. The glow adds an extra pizzazz.😄,2021,04
"Worked great for about 1 week. Now won't work. Love the color and that it was a ""quiet click"" but disappointed that it died.",2021,04
Product did not move smoothly across the mouse pad and did not fit my hand particularly well.,2021,04
....not so great with the rendering. Dragging objects with the mouse is not so great. Especially acrosss screens. I work on visio a lot and its just very hard to get this to drag stuff around. So basically has a bad sensor. But its smooth and very quiet.,2021,04
I absolutely love my mouse. It's good quality and last a pretty long time before needing a charge.,2021,04
"Not bad, rechargeable and portable. Highly recommend",2021,04
Don’t buy this! You have to charge it every day. You might as well have a mouse with a cord because that’s what it ends up being. It does not take a battery and Hass to be charged all the time.,2021,04
"Battery lasts forever, smooth and sleek design. If you use the middle mouse button, it's a little hard to click, but that's literally the only downside. Would recommend this mouse to anyone else looking for an affordable sleek mouse.",2021,04
Nice and soft but the laser isn’t very accurate,2021,04
"Very light weight and low for click sounds. Long battery life,Easy to pair. Nice feeling of touch with my hand, I love to use this mouse for my WOT game on my laptop.",2021,01
"The mouse worked immediately but stopped responding after 2 minutes. No troubleshooting worked, laptop recognized the dongle the whole time, but couldn't move the cursor or click. Tried on an additional computer and still no luck.",2021,04
It is really quite except that the scroll button when you click it is really loud. RGB is decent for the price but I wish it was brighter. Overall its decent,2021,04
"I wanted a silent mouse due to classes using proctorio with a professor who was huge on thinking sounds could be cheating. I absolutely loved how silent it is when you press the buttons. Only thing I haven't got to work as well is the wireless aspect but it doesn't bother me, I just plug it in for charging wise and use it as a wired mouse. I love the changing lights as well, works well for my laptop. I loved having a light up gaming mouse for my desktop and now have something similar to use for my laptop that's quiet.",2021,04
I LOVE IT,2021,04
Had it five days and it would not recharge! Threw it away!,2021,04
Love this mouse. Love that I don't need to use batteries anymore. It's comfortable to use as well,2021,04
Didn’t work piece of crap,2021,04
Nice looking mouse,2021,04
Easy to set up / connect....happy with this product,2021,04
I wanted silent or soft clicks and that's what I got. The led light were a bonus for me.,2021,04
The mouse will not charge. And it feels cheaply made.,2021,04
Broken right after ran out of return window came . The narrow keep moving and linking event when is using or not using it. Don’t know what problem with it.,2021,04
"This mouse does what it needs for the most part. However, the cursor itself will jump all over the page from time to time which is annoying.",2021,04
"The one I'm currently using has been dropped a number of times, & is currently wrapped with scotch tape.  I wanted new one in the  event the older one gives up & quits on me.  And with this newer, sleeker one it has a splace for the USB connector to be stored (for travel purposes), on the underside of the mouse.  Another great feature, I think!",2021,04
"I love this mouse! I actually purchased two because of the look, but they are great! I use one at my home office and one at my office.",2021,04
"This mouse is rechargeable, which is great, except that it doesn't hold a charge. I charged it all night and the next day, it died after using it for 5 minutes. I would not recommend this item and will go back to a wireless mouse that uses batteries.",2021,04
The battery life on this mouse is terrible.  It lasts maybe a day to a day and a half without recharging. Also a bit small and the grip is slippery.  I would not recommend it to anyone.,2021,04
"I love the mouse, but sometimes it randomly stops working and my computer won’t recognize it. I noticed it did this when I used the changing color settings. I recommend just keeping it on “on” and not the changing colors setting.",2021,04
"Great product. Works as advertised, light and cool colors!!",2021,04
It quit working after 2 weeks,2021,04
It stopped working after jus 3 days. It Sucks period!!!,2021,04
"It is okay. The scroll wheel and clicker are quiet, but the mouse emits a super high frequency noise any time it moves. I have become aware of it and can't stand using it much anymore.",2021,04
I bought this for my laptop for school work and it exceeded my expectations!!! The colors are amazing and not too distracting. So easy to connect and use. It’s also silent. I love it!,2021,04
"This mouse is great! It feels good in your handle, glides well, easy to use and looks amazing while doing it. It makes work a little less boring and looks so sleek on my desk.",2021,04
Really like this mouse (never thought I’d say that..)It stores the USB port in its belly when you need to disconnect which is super helpful for someone who loses small pieces. It’s a quiet click which I appreciate even when working alone. And the rainbow lighting is optional.Win win win.It’s light too as it’s rechargeable! I carry it with my laptop and it’s made working on the go better,2021,04
The mouse stopped working after about a month of use.,2021,04
This is the best mouse and I love that it is rechargeable. I haven't had a lag problem unlike a mouse that requires batteries. I loved it so much I bought another ❤,2021,04
The item is supposed to wake up after turning itself off in order to save battery but mine never did. I had to turn it off and then on again.And then after 3 days the cursor began moving wildly by itself and then later that day the buttons stopped working entirely.,2021,04
"Finally! The wireless, rechargeable mouse works as advertised. Small, handy, recharging is easy.",2021,04
Nice Mouse but I have had other rechargeable and this one seriously lacks uptime. I'm getting about a few days and dies quickly. My first one would last weeks but I lost it at a conference.... I should have went back to it...,2021,04
"It worked for 5min and then got stuck in my laptop, looks like made of cheap material",2021,04
This product is useless and the quality is abysmal! I have never complained about any product I purchased from Amazon (or through Amazon) in the last 20 years as a customer. Please inform all your customers that this product is a cheap quality piece of damnation!,2021,04
"Worked great for less than a month. Received in April 4 and broke today, May 2. No clue what happened. I went to use it after taking a break for a few hours and it just fell apart and I'm not able to put it back together.",2021,04
I wasn't sure what to expect with this mouse but it works perfectly. I never thought I'd be so excited to use a wireless mouse.,2021,04
It works okay but is hard to charge.,2021,04
The metal piece that is attached to the chip on the ubs broke off in my side brand new laptop... talking about being sick,2021,04
"Honestly feels a bit on the cheap side, and compared to other similar makes, the main difference being LED lighting so it adds a 'wow' factor to it. Clicking is also smooth and feels nice, and the top-down view is pleasing. The lighting itself is mostly smooth but blotchy at some points where the color is abrupt rather than a seamless transition.Performance wise it does the job, but ergonomically doesn't feel as form-fitting as a gaming mouse. I'd really use this as a backup work mouse or a home mouse where its just to surf the web. Also the cursor sometimes randomly jumps. First time this has happened on a mouse, so it seems like they really cut costs and marked up the price.If I were to guess the price if I'd seen the product without a price tag, I'd probably say its about 6-7 bucks.",2021,04
This was a horrible purchase. I am returning this because it sucked.,2021,04
"Developers really did-a-number with this device! This mouse speaks for itself. It is actually just what the marketing team indicated, AWESOME! I am a customizable type of consumer, thus I enjoy my share of intriguing components that of which deviates from the mundane norm. This led mouse Wowed-Me with the illuminating colorful lighting and the smoothness upon usage. Very well crafted and I look forward to purchasing other colors as time progress.",2021,04
"This is a great mouse. Quiet, responsive, fun color!",2021,04
"The main thing for me is that it is really pretty. Maybe that's just a girl reason to like it but I am a girl. And an artist. And maybe a wee bit eccentric. I want stuff around me to add to my environment, especially now. Other than that, well, its a mouse. It does all the same things other computer mice do and it does it well. And its pretty!",2021,04
"It’s cool, feels pretty smooth and nice light colors but the battery doesn’t last long.",2021,04
"The USB plug broke and the case around the chip got stuck inside the port. I can pull the USB out but the case stays inside the port. It's still useable if I put it back in though. It also has a very high pitched dog whistle kind of noise when it moves, especially when it's used close to the USB plug. It is not silent... that's for sure. I have to use music or headphones when I use this mouse or it drives me insane.It's shallow depth is kind of hard on my hand, but I have arthritis so I usually need a thicker/taller mouse to fill my palm to be comfortable. But I bought this mouse as a backup for my work laptop, so I don't use it as much as I use my gaming mouse.I like that you can still use it when it's plugged in to charge if you use a longer cable.",2021,04
Love my pretty mouse!  It’s cooler than anyone else’s mouse!!!,2021,04
This is a great mouse. Easy to use runs very smoothly and the color matched my keyboard perfectly. I would recommend this product to anybody.,2021,04
Battery last. Great for kid to use.,2021,04
Pretty good mouse for when I do school work,2021,04
The slim design feels amazing. The price is perfect and the lights on it just make it fun.  Worth it!,2021,04
This is a fun mouse! Love the gold and the light show it provides. Most importantly it works so well and makes me work at light speed!,2021,04
" Its an okay mouse. I disliked how ""cheap"" it appears because the rose gold color I got was a light spray on top and there are 3 distinct areas where the light is shining through.I'm also disappointed that when I turn the color changing led off but keep the mouse on that its a constant red color - which was not in the description.It also goes into sleep mode quickly and takes a good 15 seconds to reconnect which is frustrating.",2021,04
"I really like this mouse, it works very well and I do like the sleep mode for saving its charge. It’s only less desirable aspect is its cord. The connector at the mouse end does not slide smoothly into the connection.",2021,04
Just all around terrible mouse,2021,04
Love it. Slim line and fits in laptop bag much nicer than my old one and it's pretty!,2021,04
This is a good product.  It fits well in my hand and I love that it is rechargeable.  I would buy this mouse again.  I don't use it for gaming since that is something I don't do.  It serves my purpose well.,2021,04
Got this for my daughter and she loves it. It is rechargeable and lights up. She loves that it is so quiet when she is using it to play a game.,2021,04
"I knew it was too good to be true, this would be a great mouse but it just stopped working after a week. I have charged it a few times prior, no issues. I went to use it today and nothing. I would avoid and spend a few more bucks on something not as cheaply made.",2021,04
Works great in laptop. Very aesthetically pleasing. Ready to use and install,2021,04
"Like others have reported, the mouse curser jumps around and blinks after a short (30 min) period of use making it difficult to control and sometimes nonresponsive. You have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision. I charged it over the weekend thinking the battery was not fully charged but the same results this morning. I have requested a refund and will be purchasing something that works.",2021,04
Item came broken/ definitely looks used. I tried to charge and use still but scroll doesn’t work.,2021,01
"This mouse arrived yesterday. I plugged it in for 2 hours, per the instructions, and then started to use it. It worked GREAT!Once I got off work, I turned it off and went about my merry way. When I returned and had to check on something, I tried to use it again and it is completely non-responsive. I've tried different USB ports, unplugging and replugging the dongle, and I even charged it overnight to ensure that it had a full charge.It does not work. I was so excited for this mouse. It's slim and quiet, which are both great qualities with the amount of travel that I do while still getting some work done on my vacations... but it's not worth the money. Less than 24 hours later and I'm back to having to use my trackpad because this mouse decided it wasn't going to work any longer.",2021,04
Will be returning middle track roller does not work. If the mouse sits idle for to long it loses wireless connection  with the computer and  you have to shut it off and turn it back on. The led color changer is cool other than that it's just ok.,2021,04
Didn’t buy this for gaming but it’s a smooth mouse which I love. I work from home and utilize this while on my work and home lap tops.,2021,04
Love it very ergonomic,2021,04
The coolest mouse ever! It charges quickly and lasts a long time. I love the color changes and the smoothness it scrolls with.,2021,04
"I really like that it comes with a USB-C adapter. Saved my life because the new MacBooks aren't compatible with USB. Over all a really nice mouse, fits in my hand perfectly and I love the lights on it.",2021,04
Cute,2021,04
I love this mouse and the color mold is nice. Works well as WiFi mouse.,2021,04
"Mine did not hold a charge very long.A day at the most, if I don't use it for work.When I used it for work, I needed to plug it in half through my workday. So I use it only on my private computer couple hours a day.",2021,04
I really like my new LED Wireless mouse. It is easy to hold and it's really to look at. The LED lights change colors and it works great as a mouse. It adds some fun to your normal day. I love it!!,2021,04
"I really love my mouse, I have no issues at all. I'm thinking about ordering my sister one, she saw mines and instantly fell in love with it. Order you one, you won't regret it.",2021,04
This has been a great mouse thus far. I love the sleep mode and does not have a large arch for your hand. Very much recommend.,2021,04
The mouse stopped working after one week. I got no response from their customer service.,2021,04
"Really nice mouse, smooth, responsive & the clicks are pretty noiseless. This is my first wireless RGB mouse I get, so far I'm not disappointed. You can also use it while connected to the charging cable.",2021,04
Didn’t work-sending back,2021,04
"I like the look and feel of this mouse,  however the fact that you have to charge it is kind of a pain. It doesn't make it through a full work day so usually by the end of thebday I have to plug in my wired mouse.",2021,04
This mouse was a certifiable piece of crap. Worked until the initial charge was drained and never again. DO NOT BUY THIS HUNK OF JUNK.,2021,04
Wife loves it She uses it daily with no issues. LED is nice and bright!  Would be nice to add a larger capacity battery.,2021,04
"Grabbed this for my laptop so I don't have to mess with the trackpad for work. After 2 days of use, it no longer holds a charge. Not the fault of the charge port, as I switched it to a different one to be sure. The price is too good to be true!",2021,04
Like it,2021,04
This product stop working after 1 month,2021,04
"I loved this , but I’ve only had it two months and it stopped working .",2021,04
"Easy to use, great on the hand. Good product!",2021,04
"This mouse feels very sleek to the hand. However, the battery only lasts about 3 hours and takes about an hour to charge fully. The LED lights are not very bright; even when I turn the feature off the mouse still dies in about three hours.",2021,04
"Love this mouse!Mouse came days before delivery ETA which was always nice. Love that it's rechargeable. No more dead batteries mid work shift! Mouse connected right away to my ThinkPad. I ordered the white and the illuminating changing colors look awesome! Mouse is low profile with a really nice feel to it. I tend to run through computer mice pretty quick so only time will tell for Longevity. So far it's a 10/10 for me.Do note with the white version the colors bleed through the top as you can see in the picture and video however still looks cool to me, just different than the advertised photos.",2021,04
Easy to use and love that it's rechargeable!,2021,04
"Was so excited for this mouse, loved the style and lights when I ordered it. Once I received it, I used it for approx half a day and then it died and never turned back on. I charged it through the pc for quite a while, when I realized it hadnt charged I tried a wall outlet. Never turned back on. I went through some of the reviews after and realized it was a running theme and that many other customers had the same experience. dont waste your time.",2021,04
I have only used it for a few months and it already broke when I dropped it on the floor. It's too fragile.,2021,04
Nice mouse,2021,04
Works well.,2021,04
"This product worked only for the first time I have charged it and then could not hold any charge. I have kept it plugged for a whole day without success. Do not waste your money, get a decent product from a decent manufacturer.",2021,04
"I liked the ergonomics the most. Very easy to hold the mouse. My palm did not pain, inspite of heavy usage. It restarts quickly from sleep mode. Consumes less power. Perfect buy. Value for the money. Highly recommend.",2021,04
I love this mouse!,2021,04
"Very long range Bluetooth, super smooth for laptop gaming, totally recommended!!!",2021,04
Battery dies way too fast.,2021,04
"This is the cheapest, flimsy made in China item I’ve seen. Do not buy it. Never worked out of the box.",2021,04
"The mouse works well asked is comfortable to use, but the changing lights drain the battery very quickly.",2021,04
Doesn’t stay charged long and some functions don’t work.,2021,04
Haven’t had it year and I have barely used it and it’s already stopped working right. The mouse just goes all over the place on the screen and not where you try to put it.,2021,04
So light and love it being rechargeable,2021,04
"Decent if you like a simple mouse.  Cool lights, as well.",2021,04
How do u attached it to Bluetooth on a MacBook help,2021,04
Like the size,2021,04
"It was great while it lasted. This mouse has a low profile, it’s easy on the hands and eye-pleasing (white).  The internal battery holds charge well. I used it for work (8-10 hr/day) and but it suddenly stopped working after a few days short of 10 months. I will look for something more durable for replacement.",2021,04
i love it and i hope you buy it i love it and i hope you love it too,2021,04
There were no instructions with the mouse.,2021,04
i really love the long battery life  of this mouse. i was wandering before buying this stuff. but once I got it I didn't wanted to go back to other mouse. i even suggested my friends to buy. and they are happy with the purchase,2021,04
"I had to get another mouse. This wouldn’t respond to clicks or scrolling about 50% of the time, even when I got the 3M mousepad that improves mouse functioning.",2021,04
There are two light modes. I like the color changing option.,2021,04
Works great. No complaints.,2021,04
" Very light,trendy , easy to connect and use . really love it",2021,04
"I got a brand new laptop everything is up to date , yet when i plug in the receiver It says it malfunctions. When looking at “devices” it says driver error. I uninstalled, re-installed , Reset my computer multiple times. Do not get this.",2021,04
"I love the colors that it shuffles through.  I also like that it is virtually sound proof.  No more hearing a click from across the room.  Only thing, I wish I could pick a stationary color, instead of that feature always being red.",2021,04
"Easy on the hand, looks great, recharge easy!",2021,04
It seems to be working just fine to me when it came. Also I like the glowing effect from the led lights,2021,04
I didn't need the lights and everything. It's pretty annoying as the mouse wanders quite a bit and won't always listen to where you're trying to go.,2021,04
My mouse is not working properly. I just purchased it not even a week ago. Sending it back,2021,04
"Very quiet, nice lighting",2021,04
Love it! So far no problems! Love the way it looks and feels. Highly recommend!,2021,04
Product is awesome. Very soft and silent.  Great for gaming.,2021,04
Needs charging more than the average wireless mouse.,2021,04
"Great little mouse, light weight and I love the colorful lights and can turn off when not using to save charging power.",2021,04
I love the mouse but I’m having to charge it a lot more often than I expected.,2021,04
Reacts a little slow,2021,04
It's super quiet. I have it plugged in through a hub adapter to a Google Slate tablet and it worked immediately. No issues at all. Lights up and color changes which is just a cool add-on feature. No complaints here. Very portable.,2021,04
You spelt 'durable' wrong. So say goodbye to me and my money.,2021,04
"It’s really cute and small. It fits well in my hands and feels nice. It worked well for about  a week. After that, it started having a lag. I thought maybe it’s that I did not charge it well but I did.Idk if it’s a me problem or it’s the mouse but I haven’t been able to use it due to the lag.",2021,04
Stopped working shortly after I started using it,2021,04
"I found this mouse to be too small for my hand and I'm not a large person by any means.  It might work for a child, but I found that my thumb kept blocking the left button.  Changing lighting was just distracting, although I might have become used to it if I could actually get the left mouse button to work.  It is also too flat for good ergonomics.  A hand at rest is normally more arched than this mouse allows.",2021,04
"This mouse has a wonderful feel to it and the lights are pretty. However the first one broke not even five minutes into using it. It stopped being able to click. Second one lasted one day, the quit tracking. Pieces of junk. i am returning both.",2021,04
Cute and fun to watch while using,2021,04
I have small hands and this fits perfectly.  Very cute and lightweight,2021,04
 Sooo this thing is so cute for starters. It’s light weight and without my mouse pad it smooths across surfaces easily. The buttons aren’t hard and actually it’s easier to click on different things.Only negatives I have. When it goes into sleep mode I have to turn it on and off.And the second thing is a pro and con for me. The usb chip to make the mouse work wireless is stored under the mouse. I love it because it makes traveling with this mouse for work super easy. I just wish it had a latch release. I had to use a card to pop it out. Other than those 2 things it’s great! I didn’t even have to charge it when I took it out the box.,2021,04
"Terrible product, charge lasts only a couple of hours.",2021,04
"This mouse is so sensitive if The surface is not absolutely debris free or flat signal signal won’t be sent from the wireless mouse to the computer screen. I’ve had it for several weeks and have tried it with several mouse pads, surfaces, paper under the mouse, it’s just not a good fit.I like the changing light color, it’s very pretty, but for me not a great wireless mouse.",2021,03
It turns off when I’m using it sometimes,2021,03
Very chic and love the way it lights up. It has two settings either leave the lights totally on or have them cut on as you tap on the buttons. Works wonderful and I have only had to charge it one time since I've had the mouse.,2021,03
The first mouse did not work however I was sent a gift certificate for my trouble .  The other mouse (same model) works greatEasy to find because of the lights,2021,03
" Great mouse, the best for the price!!!",2021,03
"For the price its been great,  functionality is good. Light weight, can't go wrong!",2021,03
It didn’t sync with my laptop.,2021,03
"The mouse was stunning when I first got it, it was very fluent but the one problem and a VERY major problem for me was the fact that the mouse kept left clicking every time I right clicked and my chromebook didn't have a setting to fix it.  Overall it was just an annoying issue.",2021,03
"I like how easy it flow while using it, also how it lights up in different colors. Comfortable in my palm too.I would recommend",2021,03
"Its very light, and fast. Comfortable,  and changes different colors!! A great buy!",2021,03
"There are two things I like about this wireless mouse: (1) it's rechargeable. It took me a while to get used to plugging it into my laptop when I'm not using it, but it's easy through the USB cable they provide and the charge lasts; and (2) while there is an on-off button, it's not so necessary as it goes into sleep mode when I close my laptop. All told, I am very satisfied with this mouse.",2021,03
Sleek and ergonomic to the touch!,2021,03
I use this with my MacBook Pro and it works great! Very quiet and smooth.,2021,03
While re-chargeable the battery life is terrible.  Feels cheap and does not track well.  Tossed in in the rubbish and purchased and Amazon Basics mouse.  Less expensive and far more capable alternative.,2021,03
"I bought the gold. It's a soft brushed color and it's very quiet during use. The brightness of the color change is soft also. It fits comfortably in my palm, good purchase.",2021,03
"It looks good, feels good, but just works poorly. Did not track smoothly at all, and more times than not I’m trying to get the pointer to stop having a little seizure on the screen. Tried with and without a pad under it.",2021,03
Works great! Comfortable and smooth.,2021,03
I have had this mouse for about seven days and it is not track well if there’s a delay and it’s only broken the click button has already broken. My advice if you want something very sleek it’s a great sleek mouse but it’s not reliable. Don’t cheap out and get a better mouse.,2021,03
"This mouse is awesome. It charges quickly and comes with an adapter for the new Apple Mac plug thing. I hated my other Dell mouse and this one is so smooth, quick to react, and quiet! I never thought it would make a difference, but my students can not hear my annoying clicking anymore! 10/10 recommend.",2021,03
"It's so quiet and easy on my hands when making art on my laptop. This mouse has smooth cursor movement and is super easy to charge, no more batteries!",2021,03
"cool mouse, slim, and comfortable .",2021,03
Pretty cool devise. Easy to install. No instructions needed,2021,03
The mouse is very comfortable to use sturdy and fun with the LED light. Great Quality for the price,2021,03
"I love this mouse! The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because the scroll wheel is opposite. When I scroll forward (away from me) the page goes down and when I scroll backwards (towards me) the page goes up. I'm getting used to it, but I'd rather it just be like a normal mouse. Is there any way to fix this? Or does anyone else have this problem?",2021,03
I love this mouse for the most part. The colors are vivid and it feels nice in my hand. The only downside is that the right click has a tendency to stick even when I am only using the left click. I've had it for a few days now and that's the only negative.,2021,03
This mouse is great for what I use it for I like the RGB effects not really designed for gaming,2021,03
 This mouse is lightweight.  It charges fast by a small cable which is included.  It does not take batteries. It puts on a light show of colors fun for adults or children.  This can easily be turned off by a switch on the bottom of the mouse.The mouse itself is easy to assemble.  There is a small usb plug that clips to the bottom of the mouse for storage when you are not using it.  This plugs into your computers usb port when you do use it.This is a great mouse to use as a backup.  The color is great also.Review title:  Great spare mouse,2021,03
"This is a very nice mouse for my needs. I like how it lights up, especially when I am using it in the dark, which makes it easier to use, and I appreciate that I do not have to buy batteries...worth the purchase.",2021,03
"For $11, this is the best wireless mouse I’ve ever used. Set it up in two minutes, feels good in my hand, the scrolling wheel is nice and the clicking is silent! I cannot stand loud clicking mice. I got this for my work computer and think I’m also going to get one for my laptop.",2021,03
"quit working, trashed it",2021,03
The mouse is super sleek and comfortable for people who like their hands more flat. Super pretty when all lit up and works perfectly! but you better not drop it or drop anything you're carrying it in because it instantly will stop working every 2 minutes you use it there after. I should have expected this from such a cheap mouse but after one minor drop is ridiculous.,2021,03
The mouse had no issues working with my Windows 10 over all so nice and silence i lovet,2021,03
Bought this for my new laptop I bought and I love this mouse. the color changing amuses me so that is why I thought hmmm ok I will buy it and i'm so happy I did.,2021,03
Very easy setup! Nice and stylish. Great product for the price.,2021,03
"This is so pretty! Fits I'm my hand perfect, the lights are soooo pretty lol it was beyond easy to set up on my laptop. It came partially charged even. So I could use right out the box. Easy to charge. Lasts really long time too. Love it, would totally gift!!!",2021,03
This product is not worth the money. It stopped working all together after 2 and 1/2 months.,2021,03
"It changes color and that feature can be switched on and off. But that's it. It doesn't work at all as a mouse with my MacBook, even with using the included receivers.",2021,03
"Love this mouse for my laptop. Glad I chose this one. Not only is it comfortable, slim and sleek in my palm, but I love the rotating fun colors that it emits, which can also be turned off for the single-color mode.",2021,03
Really quite while in use and beautiful to look at.,2021,03
do not buy this! it doesnt connect or show up on my laptop to pair it. i dont suggest anyone buy this item,2021,03
"Purchased for my 9 year old daughter....she absolutely loves it! Sleek design, great for small desks and true to color. Highly recommend!!",2021,03
Great Product 100% recommended!,2021,03
"The mouse is contained in a Japanese package but was made in China. It comes with the type-c adapter, c-charging/usb cable, regular 2.0 USB mouse receiver, and thin instructions.I've plugged the Type C adapter into two different machines with the same result. Neither laptops read the type c directly or through another adapter. I've also tried another wireless mouse receiver in the type c with the same results. None of them work through this adapter.Other than that issue the mouse works. It also goes to sleep so by clicking the mouse one is able to use it again. The also other nice feature is that it is wireless with no battery included. Just plug in the charging cord into an empty USB slot.The color changing around the rim of the mouse gives a nice touch, and although at first the mouse feels 'long' due to it's sleek shape, it does fit comfortably in the hand. It also has a plastic-like feeling, and on the instructions it says to avoid dropping the mouse so it doesn't malfunction or break.",2021,03
Very sleek looking. As pictured. I love the color. Good product,2021,03
"Great, works good",2021,03
It’s a great ergonomic mouse for gaming.,2021,03
I use this mouse every day at my desk. It has a very long battery time limit and working amazingly. Highly recommend,2021,03
Well enough,2021,03
It matches my computer,2021,03
This mouse has been so much better on my wrists.  It’s sleek new design makes it easier to sit all day without the need to move to another position to relieve the strain on my wrist. I love the rechargeable aspect because I no longer need to struggle with the endless supply of battery replacements. It is so easy to sync up and was ready to go right away. So many colors to choose from too!,2021,03
"The rose gold color is very pretty, and the color changing effect was nice at first but after about an hour of use the colors started to glitch - the back end of the mouse was staying yellow and the front continued to change colors. There is an option to turn the colors off, but you end up with a red light that shows up randomly while moving the mouse around. It will get the job done but also feels very cheap compared to a Logitech or name brand. Get what you pay for in this case.",2021,03
 I Like the color. I thought it was going to have changing colored lights. It only close red which was disappointing. It’s also kind of flat and smaller than I expected. Overall I mean does what I need it to do.,2021,03
"i recently bought a new chromebook and wanted a wireless mouse to match, i came across this mouse and after reading the reviews figured id give it a try, i cant say how good it works yet because i never recieved the usb-c adaptor with it and for some reason cant get it to connect wireless im sure ill figure it out but it wouldve been nice to have the wire option as well. otherwise its slim which is what i wanted and i like the lights on it",2021,03
"This mouse has a very poor sensor. It will take several seconds to wake up after being inactive for a bit, and you sometimes have to click the DPI button or mouse buttons several times and shake the mouse for it to wake up. The sensor also cannot move fast. If I try moving the mouse quickly, the cursor gets very spastic and starts curving around the screen like Deja Vu is playing in the background.Speaking of clicks, the left mouse button double clicks quite a bit.The only thing this mouse has going for it is its design. Even then, the design is uncomfortable since its so flat.Find a better mouse. Please. Don't torture yourself with this.",2021,03
 Works very well. I keep the led light shut off to save battery. I've had it for about a week and haven't needed to charge it yet. I shut it off when not in use. It's so nice not to have a cord to deal with. I want to buy another one I love it so much! The color is gorgeous 😍,2021,03
"After I connected this mouse, whole mechanism fXXXXX UP...",2021,03
"I like the mouse, it operates excellent and the light show is great! Everything I wanted when I bought it. Thank you! Very cool and functional.",2021,03
I love this mouse. I got the teal and i used it for the first time today. I’m in love!,2021,03
Super comfortable to use!!,2021,03
"This mouse feel different from others I used, it’s light , comfortable and easy to control. My hand doesn’t have stretch pain after using this mouse at work  for whole shift, not light the old one .",2021,03
"Every time I use the mouse, there is this high-pitched noise! Hurts my ears",2021,03
"I purchased 2 for our office.  The mouse looked nice and the colors were pretty, but mine started having problems just a few days later.  It was unresponsive and jerky for a few days.  Then it stopped working (despite charging overnight).  I tried charging on different outlets to make sure the outlet wasn't bad, but it wouldn't hold a charge and died again within minutes.  When I asked the other employee about his identical mouse (different color) he said his never seemed to work right and wouldn't hold a charge.  I used the included cord and tried charging with the computer, with a hub, with a power strip, and with a charging block (not included) plugged into multiple outlets.When returning, I packaged the items as requested and requested the pick-up slip.  We found the return slip face down on the ground on the sidewalk several feet in front of our office a few days later- not stuck to the door or in the mailbox mounted next to our front door.  No one knocked to let us know it was delivered and we wouldn't have found it if a staff member hadn't gone out to sanitize the outside door handles.  Now we have to take it to a drop off location because a return pickup is going to cost $7 (despite the package being ready to send before the return sticker was dropped off).  I am unhappy with both the item and the return and have already ordered similar replacements from another seller.",2021,03
"This light up mouse is great, and I've had a few similar ones. I like that this one is rounded on the edges (more aesthetically pleasing, imo).It holds a charge for long enough that it's not annoying, though It would be nice if there was an option to turn the light off while using to save charge even more. The options are just ""on"" (constant red light) or ""*"" (cycles through colors). Clicks are definitely as close to silent as you could get.The only thing that is bothering me is that the wheel is squeaking after only 3 weeks of use. I intend to drop some WD40 onto it and I'm sure that will fix the problem, but I don't think that should be necessary to begin with.Overall a good choice, though!IMMEDIATE UPDATE: Directing WD40 into the ""wheel well"" of the mouse is not easy, even using a pin. Dropped the mouse, and now the wheel doesn't scroll at all, it just spins. Soooooo not great. Removing a star. Either a) accept the squeaky wheel or b) be VERY careful when trying to oil said wheel because if you drop it it will die. UGH",2021,03
"Idk if I would say this is a great mouse for gaming but, it’s great for the price and very smooth. Different setting are great too. Flip the lights on and it’s like a rave in your hand!",2021,03
"I like it, it's comfortable it's half as much as the one I was buying and does exactly the same thing. And the Pretty Lights make it good to look at also... 😁",2021,03
There’s nothing I dislike about this wireless mouse that I use with my laptop computer!  I would recommend this to anyone that would ask me about it!,2021,03
this mouse worked great... for the 5 days it worked. i tried turning it on today and it wont light up or connect to my computer. tried connecting with the cord provided but still wont work. sucks because the outlook of the mouse was cool along with the led outlining.,2021,03
It quit working after 32 days and they wouldn't take it back or refund.,2021,03
"One drop to the floor, it broke😩",2021,03
I really like this mouse. It is light and re-action is immediate. I also like its USB input. Great product.,2021,03
"it’s sooo pretty! and very easy to use. just as described online, HIGHLY recommend!! I love rose gold.",2021,03
"Small, good shape, easy to install.",2021,03
Not bad. Pretty smooth operation. No delays in movement. Connects quickly to any lap top.,2021,03
Worked great before it died after 2 months of ownership.,2021,03
I really like the slim size.  It fits into a ravel bag nicely.  I love that it can be turned off for travel and not have to remove the battery.  The Colorful lights are a nice touch.,2021,03
"Decent little wireless mouse, priced good for children who tend to lose and destroy things. Biggest issue is the charging cable that comes with it is garbage. Can be charged using a phone charger. All in all a decent purchase and would buy again!",2021,03
"Doesn't stay charged long enough, bought 2 and both are the same.  Sometime on down the road, I'llput new rechargeable batteries in both, and see if that is the problem.. They do fit nice to use, and runsmooth.",2021,01
"Just got this last night for my new ACER, when I plugged in the mouse the curser just jumps around (with usb or usb C plug).  It zig-zags across the screen when trying to move in a straight line.  It stops just short of moving to the edges of the screen and you have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision.  I charged it overnight and same results this morning, I adjusted the DPI with the button and it just jumps faster around the screen. I tried troubleshooting but I can use any other mouse in my house and they work just fine so I will be returning this mouse and purchasing something that works.",2021,03
I bought 2 and we love them,2021,03
Excellent mouse.Very smooth.,2021,03
"Exactly what it says, quite and convenient mouse.",2021,03
I would not recommend this mouse as it feels like the plastic will break on you at any second. It's very cheaply made and the light shines through the top layer of plastic which makes it look way worse!,2021,03
"Great portable mouse.  The color changing is fun, and setup was easy. Lightweight, ergonomic device.  It was also a great value.",2021,03
Worked for about a week.,2021,03
"Convenient, quite, excellent connection with computer",2021,03
DO NOT BUY!!!!  The product does not work for intended purposes... using as a mouse for my computer. It lights up and thats it!  I can’t leave zero stars... I would if I could.,2021,03
"loved it while it worked, yet here we are two months later and it literally just stopped working. I've tried multiple usb-c ports to no avail. I guess you get what you pay for",2021,03
"Love this mouse, it lives up to its description!",2021,03
USB is not compatible with the USB port of a laptop or a desktop.,2021,03
This mouse is very slim and is comfortable on your wrist. The colors are really cool and mouse battery goes for a couple of days,2021,03
So pretty and super quiet,2021,03
"I like the mouse. Originally, I thought it wast great for the price and I’m glad to be wrong. The mouse is a little sensitive because I dropped it once causing it to freeze somewhat. However, after re-installing it, it seemed to fix the issue. I also am enjoying the colour changing which helps me relax almost. Overall, highly recommend as it is compatible with pc and mac. Just plug and play.",2021,03
Not practical for me fir everyday use,2021,03
"This comes exactly as described, it works great and is easy to recharge",2021,03
"The mouse is very light and easy to use, and the changing led colors are very nice to look at.",2021,03
It’s a good mouse.,2021,03
It's sleek and there's no clicking noise when pressing mouse buttons. The (optional) lights on the mouse also helps me when I'm studying at night. I will definitely buy more of these and recommend to my work staff.Excellent Product at a great price.Good Job,2021,03
Super cute mouse. I love the color and I love the LED lights. My only issue is that it's very glitchy. Like it seems to want to do its own thing which isn't good. I sit at a desk for 8 hours and it's a completely flat surface and the mouse will move all on its own.,2021,03
Very quite clicking.,2021,03
I love the option to turn off the lights. It is nice that its rechargeable and can be used while charging if needed. The color I got was a mint color (I do not recall what it was listed as). It is a fun color and the light on the mouse are an added bonus.,2021,03
Broke immediately,2021,03
Absolutely love this mouse. If it were to break I would buy this product again!!,2021,03
"Since I mainly draw art, I didn't see a need to have a bulky gaming mouse. This fits perfectly in my hand and has very quiet clicks which is ideal when I'm drawing at night while the family is asleep. The ability to switch between changing colors or just plain mouse mode is very useful for me. I enjoy the fact that you can turn it off with that very switch too as most mice at this price range never have that option! It's a good buy for a casual office or laid back working experience.",2021,03
"This mouse was perfect for my girl gamer.  It’s everything she was looking for style wise, and worked perfectly.",2021,03
Bought for.work,2021,03
"Really like this product. I’m left handed and I’ve been searching for something universal.  It’s light, sleek and easy to transport.  The charge stayed longer than I expected.",2021,03
I got this to replace my white one that broke well let’s just say I love it. It stays charged a very long time and the color change is beautiful,2021,03
Love it!,2021,03
I bought for my son and he loves it. Compact and portable.,2021,03
Pretty but dies quick even with new batteries we returned it,2021,03
My order came fast and on time. I use this little mouse at work all the time. It is lightweight and slim enough to put in my scrub pocket for travel. Easy to clean. Only thing I see is that I cannot tell when the battery runs low. I keep an extra mouse handy for those times. But other than that no complaints!,2021,03
Its cool.,2021,01
"I like the design and feel of the mouse.  My concern is that it tends to go to sleep and anytime I have not used it for a few minutes, I have to press the button on top and then it does come right back on.  I guess with time I will learn to do that each time I want to use it.  In use, it does not function as smoothly as I had hoped it would, hesitating to start and then the curser ""hops"" when I am trying to drag it from one place to another.",2021,03
"Great product, very nice and very nice price, my daughter love it!",2021,03
This mouse will not stay connected to my computer,2021,03
 I love it it’s so easy to handle I give it out of 1 to 10 I’ll go for the 10❤️❤️ For sure ❤️,2021,03
"I purchased this mouse because I was tired of having to uninstall and re-install a bluetooth mouse I was using.  This mouse is very responsive, fits nicely in my small hand, and is an excellent buy for the price. The battery lasts and turns itself off after no use for awhile.",2021,03
This mouse is very comfortable and ergonomic. It is also very silent. The LED lights are very calming. Love it 10000% recommended.,2021,03
"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap, CheapQuit working like day 3 and now I am outside of return window.  Good thing it was cheap.  Buyers beware...spend a little more.",2021,03
Real like this mouse! It stays charged for a long time!!,2021,03
"It’s basic, sleep mode is irritating.",2021,03
"UPDATE 1:: Had it charging for less than a minute and the whole house smelled like burning plastic. In that time, the cord got super hot, and the part where it plugged into the mouse was super hot as well. Probably would have caught fire if left unattended.UPDATE 2:: Using different cords was just fine. DO NOT USE THE CORD THAT COMES WITH IT!!!UPDATE 3:: Battery won't hold a charge... I was really wanting this mouse to work, but looks like I'm returning it after all.",2021,03
Great mouse! Bought second one to take to work,2021,03
"Mouse arrived the next day.  Easy to set up and use.  Have had no problems at all,  it’s works as it should.",2021,03
This mouse did not work. The wireless receiver did work so the mouse did not connect to my laptop.,2021,03
"This mouse is seriously cool! It’s comfy, quiet click and has a light show!",2021,03

My son loves it.,2021,02
"I really like my new mouse.  Its light, and works better with my hand, the sleep mode is awesome my kids love the colors, I did some gaming last night and it worked great, I play league of legends,",2021,02
Love the slimness of the mouse without loosing great functionality.  The re-charge feature is great.,2021,02
I use it for a gaming laptop and it’s honestly amazing. Easy to set up and great for the price.,2021,02
Sleek and very kewl...low profile and easy on the hands....very satisfied with my product...😁,2021,02
I have small hands and it feels great on it.  It’s light and pretty.  Live that it changes colors.  Haven’t used it for gaming though.,2021,02
"This is the second time I buy it. It has everything .. no need for battery .. you hock it up to a laptop for charging and that's it.. comfortable while holding it..moving smoothly and got very appealing look. I bought another one from another brand and stopped working after awhile. This one is the real deal and no more exploring other mouses, I'm sticking with it.",2021,02
"I bought this mouse, because I saw it was a wireless ""silent"" click. Which was perfect for me working in a class room and not loving to hear the click of a mouse all day. I have dropped it 3 + times and each time I have been able to just move the plastic back into place and ""repair"" so the duriablily from drops is awesome for when I move between classes to see my different classes.",2021,02
Beautiful. My daughter loves it!,2021,02
"It makes an almost mute power sound when I use it, which can become annoying when I use it in a silent room. The light also makes the internal part of the mouse visible. Other than that, it works well.",2021,02
"My kiddo needed a wireless mouse to take with him to school and this was so fun for him! It’s light weight, pretty durable, and I love that he can charge it along with his laptop at night.",2021,02
"Wasn't expecting much because it seemed low priced, but have been using daily for work for about a month now and it's wonderful.  No issues.  I actually bought two of them, one grey and one gold, and they both work fine.",2021,02
this mouse works but has a high pitch noise the entire time in use !. drives me crazy .,2021,02
Was trying to find a mouse for my new laptop and came across this mouse. The best one I've found. I like that it's smooth and the color is super nice.,2021,02
It was a great value. It arrived quickly. It works great. The usb-c doesn't fit my port but the mouse only need usb.,2021,02
"The mouse is really quiet, no clicking sound, which I liked.  Comfortable for the hand. Does not hold a charge very long, and nothing worse than not responding during middle of the work day. I had tried to different brands, the other was one that had bluetooth feature, so I could use it on my tablet. That held a charge all week and I will be getting another one of those.",2021,02
"Love the slimness of this mouse, and colors.  Works really well and charging by usb is so easy.",2021,01
Liked but not for me!  Needed bluetooth.,2022,05
"Love this new mouse! I work from home for my job still and use my mouse all day everyday. I was originally using a big bulky gaming mouse ( it lights up and looked cool) for the last 2 years, but now my hand is starting to hurt and was ready to downgrade to something smaller and lighter. I saw this and had to see what it was about. Let me tell you I LOVE this new mouse. Its so small and light and easy to use. The clicks are super quiet and feels so great in the hand. Yes it is plastic but it actually doesn't feel cheap and feels like a good build. It's very responsive and glides very smooth. The only gripe is to wake of up from Sleep you have to click the mouse button, instead of just moving it like most items, but that's a very minor issue. Oh, and the different colors it comes In is nice. Also, the RGB color changing lighting is a very nice effect. I definitely recommend this mouse for home or office use.",2021,02
Product as described. Looks great with the lights. Ordered twice!,2021,02
Love the product bought for my Microsoft surface pro and it works perfectly,2021,02
I love the way this mouse performs.,2021,02
This mouse stop working within 2 months of purchase. Plugged into computer via mouse with included cord and it still didn't work. Throwing in trash!!!,2021,02
Fits prefect in my hand and the lights are great to keep tack of the mouse in a dark room.,2021,02
"The mouse was working good and out of no where in the middle of me working it clicker just stop functioning.. Unfortunately, I purchase this item on the 10th of January and my return window is now close. I really felt confident about this product and it is was nice while it lasted.Edit: I was spent a replacement and it has given me any problems.",2021,02
"I’ve had this mouse since August 2021 and I don’t like writing reviews until I’ve had the item for a bit. This mouse worked great and I love how quiet it is, however about 4 weeks ago it started giving me trouble. I find myself tapping it with medium force on the desk in order for the cursor to move. I charge it completely and even completely charged, it gives me these issues.",2021,02
It was easy to setup the mouse works perfectly and I absolutely love the color change lighting!,2021,02
Looks good. Works well,2021,02
"I needed and slim mouse that was rechargeable. This little mouse saved the day!! It is ergonomic and glides smoothly on the mouse pad. I am pleased with this purchase, and the changing lights are an extra bonus!! Good, quality product.",2021,02
Not having to change the battery is what drew me to this but it goes to sleep to save power and is hard to get it working again. I thought the slim profile mouse would be ok and better for travel but it is too hard to hold. I thought it might just be my big hands and gave it to my wife. She gave it back and said it was hard for her to hold on too.,2021,02
Excellent product works right out the box,2021,02
Very smooth and easy to use. Just a good all around product.,2021,02
I love this mouse. I got the pink (gold rose) one. It's first of all so elegant.And the best part is that it's mute! The clicks are soft and smooth.,2021,02
This is a nice size mouse and I love the color and lights. You have to charge it overnight if you use it all day like I do for work.,2021,02
Love this but it looses its juice within 8 hours without it being plugged in. I work a 12 hour shift so I have to plug it in during a very busy shift so I need one with a battery,2021,02
"Absolute garbage!!! Day 2 of using. If you have it on the multicolor setting the mouse will not work. I should have known something was up when the instructions were only in mandarin. It went straight to the trash can after i couldn’t get it to work. It also feels super cheap. Please if you’re reading these reviews, we’re not lying. DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE!",2021,02
I love how smooth and easy it is to handle. I just can't change the setting from all red to multicolor to the color I want : Purple.  So I mean I wait for Purple to come around and in happy with it. It does what I need. NEEDS BETTER DETAIL INSTRUCTIONS,2021,02
This mouse is great as an everyday tool because of its ergonomics and functionability.,2021,02
"This was a nice mouse, I wouldn't recommend for children as it broke when dropped on floor. Adult use seems like it would be fine.",2021,02
Love everything about it. I recommend it.,2021,02
"I love the way the mouse looks and feels, but oh the mistakes I make! This mouse has a mind of it's own and jumps all over the place. I have accidentally closed files/programs while working on them, move public folder (and having to contact IT to move back), and many more random errors as a result of this erratic mouse. Sometimes, while not even using the mouse - I can see the curser go on walkabout all over my screen. Perhaps there is a ghost in the machine, but if so, they are hostile... I will be replacing it ASAP!",2021,02
" I wish I would have seen the video from another reviewer with the white mouse before I purchased the white one.I don't like the fact that the light is visible throughout the whole mouse. I assumed it would just be a line of light that circles the mouse as shown in the sellers pictures. If you like the look of the whole mouse lighting up as shown in the video then this is the mouse for you.Overall, I do like the mouse and don't want to deal with exchanging. I planned on getting the mint and I should have gone with my instincts. It glides smoothly and the clicks are slient. I won't be returning it because I do like it but just diappointed the white one was not as shown/described",2021,02
Loved it... until it stopped working and wouldn’t charge in a couple months... now just junk.,2021,02
"Really nice rat, I would definitely recommend.It feels great, rechargeable, cool LED colors and WIRELESS!",2021,02
I have been using for about 6 weeks and it died. It will not charge.,2021,02
"A rechargeable cordless mouse is such a good idea and invention. You don't have to deal with batteries.  And this mouse seemed not to need recharging for over a day.. Great!!This one I bought worked well even though it did something odd,  (and I am not sure if it was the mouse or the ""inexpensive"" tablet computers that I use,  or maybe the USB splitters that I use, however it was probably the mouse ) but  after using the mouse normally for a few hours,  the mouse  would then  not show the arrow on the screen and I found that I would have to turn off the swatch on the mouse and then turn it back on again. It was  as if  I had to re-boot the mouse periodically.  It seemed to have  nothing to do with recharging. This would happen even after the mouse had been fully recharged.  It would be unpredictable as to when it would happen but overall even that was  a minor flaw.But then one day, ( actually the date of this writing March 16 2021)  I put the mouse receiver into a different receptacle to use a different tablet computer  and it would not work no matter what I tried to do.  Then I decided to take out the receiver from the USB receptacle  and found that the metal, square part on the receiver stuck into the USB receptacle.  So this leads me to believe that possibly the mouse receiver  became faulty with regular use over  a few weeks  since I bought it.  Otherwise the way that the receiver was made was not in the best possible way. Not rugged enough maybe.However though I don't know  at this point  if this is the way that  ALL these rechargeable mouses are  (this brand)  or if this particular one that I bought  just did not actually pass quality control at the factory,  it seems the company should give me a replacement.I am going to see about it but I guess  I will be told that the deadline for returns had been reached.I will update if I am able to.",2021,02
The wife loves it. we use it for the camera system,2021,02
"This mouse is great, and if it didn't do this one annoying thing I would give it 5 stars. It emits a really high pitched squeal when you don't use a mousepad. It coincides with the LED light color change, if you pick it up and set it down, it makes a really high frequency sound that is very irritating if you work in a quiet environment, which I do. It's similar to a smoke alarm if it were far away. Get one that doesn't have the lights, that should help.",2021,02
"The only thing I do not like is having to charge it with a usb.  Sometimes I’m trying to use it and it’s dead, so I connect to computer and I can use it.  Works best with longer cord that I don’t have.",2021,02
"I HAD THE MOUSE CHARGING ALL WEEKEND. WHEN I RETURNED TO WORK MONDAY MORNING, I SMELLED SOMETHING HOT, BUT NO ONE ELSE SMELLED ANYTHING. I WENT TO UNPLUG MY MOUSE AND MY CORD WAS SO HOT I COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH IT. THE ENTIRE CORD MELTED AND THE WIRES HAD BURNED THROUGH THE RUBBER COATING. VERY EASILY COULD HAVE CAUGHT MY COMPUTER ON FIRE. DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE UNLESS YOU HAVE GREAT FIRE INSURANCE!",2021,02
"The scrolling wheel doesn’t work, my daughter was so excited to use this but it won’t scroll. Other than that, cute mouse.",2021,02
It doesn’t move! I used for 2days and gave up! Really bad ...,2021,02
"Works good, my son loves it",2021,02
This mouse works great and I love that it's rechargeable. Just plug it in to my laptop for a couple hours and we're good to go.,2021,02
I used this for my security system and works very good.  Easy to set up,2021,02
Performs as advertised and is easy to plug in and use.,2021,02
Love it!,2021,02
Great wireless mouse! Super quiet clicks!,2021,02
Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money this cheap flimsy mouse that only works for a couple of weeks.,2021,02
"Great at first... then after a month, it stopped working - it's like the battery was weak and it was slow to respond to movement and felt sticky.  Do not recommend.",2021,02
"Very good quality. Sleek and pretty. I use it for my desk at work. The only issue is when I'm using it to scroll a page, the ball starts squeaking. Otherwise it's great.",2021,02
GOOD MOUSE FOE EVERY DAY USE,2021,02
I thought this mouse was gonna work really good and  last a long time based on the reviews. Unfortunately the charger that came with the mouse isn't charging the mouse. I tried everything to get it to work and would not. The mouse worked for a few hours before dying on me. Not a good purchase and not satisfied with their product.,2021,01
I love all the colors this mouse has keep on thru the nite last a long time on one charge,2021,01
Works great!!!,2021,01
Good,2021,01
Works well and the color matches my laptop perfectly!,2021,01
"Simply put, it is a great mouse for what it's worth. However, I had difficulty connecting the mouse to my macbook pro with the USB c adapter that comes with the product. I have 4 ports. The manual (grammar is terrible btw) tells you to try different ports which they claim it will work normally in one of them.. NONE OF THEM WORKED which was a bummer.. then I tried with my own adapter and it connected it right away! The adapter they provide you is just useless. So if you plan on getting this mouse to use with your macbook, you should get a separate adapter. Once I connected it though, it seemed to work perfectly..smooth tracking, silent clicks and the RGB lighting is beautiful. I just got it today so hopefully, it will keep working the way they claim it should work.",2021,01
The wireless feature and recharging from computer.,2021,01
"Just go to your local department store. When I opened the package and inspected the mouse, it had obvious scratches and looked like there was some wear on the bottom. It works and gets the job done. I bought this mouse because I was tired of buying batteries for another wireless mouse. The mouse will not work when you have it plugged into the computer to charge.",2021,01
stopped working. Cant return either.,2021,01
"Seemed to work okay for the minute I used the mouse for my security camera nvr system BUT it had scratches around both sides. Looked to be an obvious return (actually my first from Amazon) because the power cord looked to have been used also. Will be returning because when I buy new, I expect new.",2021,01
Good mouse for regular use. Great rgb lighting,2021,01
Super easy to use. Just plug in to do the initial charge and then recharge via the USB cord as needed. Kinda fun to have the light display change colors throughout the day. Soft touch when you right or left click and barely makes any clicking noise.,2021,01
"Worked fine for what was needed, fell off of the table one time and broke in half. Wouldn’t purchase again for my disabled mother.",2021,01
"Just ordered this as a nice wireless mouse for my Surface Pro. It works nice but when I went to pull the USB out of the Surface pro, part of it stayed stuck in the port.  I had to use pliers to pull it out. Not sure if this just a tight fit or poor workmanship.  Other than that the Mouse works fine.",2021,01
Love this mouse,2021,01
Its fast,2021,01
"I don't normally like using a mouse when I am on my laptop, but they built in keys on my laptop were starting to go so I decided to purchase a mouse. When looking for a mouse, I wanted something sleek and able to take with me to school and back. It fits my hand perfectly and I enjoy how sleek it looks. The only thing that I would change is being able to decide the color(s) and color patterns. Other than that, it was worth the purchase.",2021,01
Product stopped working shortly after a month. Wouldn’t click properly.,2021,01
I love this mouse but hate it at the same time. I love it because it’s cute and it functions well.....that is if it doesn’t run out of battery charge. During normal use the charge only lasts for about 3 days. It’s good that it can be recharged I just didn’t think I would be recharging it that often. You can tell when it’s running low because it starts jumping all over the place. I just try to remember to charge it while I’m charging my laptop. Also I was under the impression that it came as a usbc to charge and it does not. It comes with an adapter for usb to usbc. I could’ve just got an adapter for my old mouse had it been made clear.,2021,01
Love for the most part charges fast but runs out fast. Hard to see the pointer arrow have closed lots of things by accidentRn,2021,01
"Slightly annoying that it had to be recharged to even use it but the design is sleek, good size and QUIET!!",2021,01
I bought this. Love the looks and the feel however I used it for 4 days and it quit working.,2021,01
"Sensor doesn’t always pick up movements. To clarify, I am not using this f gaming but as a wireless mouse for work and coaching speech and debate. Sometimes when I sit for too long, the sensor takes time to come back online Andreas movements. This can be super frustrating when you are working and you need to move with alacrity but such is the life that one would expect from a $13 mouse.Overall, I’d you are doing menial office tasks, this is probably an okay mouse. The rechargeable batter is cool and I am happy to not have to replace batteries but I would probably go with a wired mouse in the future.",2021,01
"Nice, the only problem I've noticed so far is it's really hard to click the scroll (middle button). It's just really stiff.",2021,01
Works great and battery lasts a long time! I’ve used it everyday since i purchased it a month or so ago and havent had to charge it many times. Clicks are very quiet as well and the light setting looks amazing,2021,01
Product works great love it.,2021,01
It work super great. i recommend for other to buy,2021,01
"The click isn't loud but it does get picked up by my gaming computer recorder. The battery doesn't last near long enough, not even a whole day, even when you don't have the lights on. It does feel nice in the hand, it does track well but I would say a mouse pad isn't optional with this one.",2021,01
"I like it, it is true to no noise",2021,01
"Great product, delivery and price!",2021,01
"I'm not a mouse person, I prefer the track pad but need it for work. Absolutely love it, even use it on my personal computer",2021,01
I never write reviews. As a matter of fact this is the first I have ever written but due to the danger factor I felt compelled to.My son plugged in his mouse this morning and walked away and within a minute my husband smelled something burning and fortunately was able to get to it before the flames- yes flames reached the drapes because the charging cable caught on fire.,2021,01
Works well,2021,01
I got this mouse for my daughter and she was beyond excited when we finally received it. Well day 1 it wouldn’t charge. So i gave it a break and decided to try charging it on my Mac (she had originally tried w/ her school chrome book). Few seconds of it being plugged in & it started SMOKING. It smelled like burning plastic so I quickly just unplugged and didn’t bother doing anything else with the mouse.,2021,01
"Great mouse for travel as it is very slim and ergonomic. Perfect for the bag that has just enough space. When you’re on the go and you need to pack up and move quickly, it’s sleep mode feature is a nice adage, increasing battery life and usability. As far as gaming goes, I would recommend only lite/casual games only, not for gaming on the heavy side. Overall 9/10 would buy again",2021,01
Scroll stopped working after 2 weeks of use,2021,01
Got this to match the skin.  Works great,2021,01
I love it best mouse I've had.,2021,01
Like it,2021,01
this mouse is amazing. it has completed my work from home station and has made my desk look less cluttered. what i love about it the most is the led lights. i would never definitely buy and recommend this to other people.,2021,01
Bought this mouse for my wife to use with her new MacBook Air. I must say this mouse has exceeded all expectations! Very happy with my purchase and will refer anyone looking for a quality mouse to this business.,2021,01
My daughter use's it for her laptop an plays a few games on it the battery life is fair since she does use the mouse alot i say about 5 to 6 hours countulessy,2021,01
I love the feel and look of it,2021,01
Purchased this mouse for my son to use for his school work and he loves it. The colors are fun and it moves smoothly! He also loves that it doesn’t make a clicking sound. Would recommend.,2021,01
mouse was great for about 24 hours when it stopped working.  a mouse even a snake would not like.  worthless.,2021,01
Perfect!,2021,01
"Pretty good. Was hard to use at the beginning seemed like it didnt work. It has sensitive spots. But once you get used to it, works just fine.",2021,01
It's A great mouse to have if you are trying to have a mouse that can be used on a type c only device while keeping the option of normal USB open.,2021,01
"I was looking for a wireless rechargeable mouse because I recently lost my old mouse but I’m kind of glad I did because I really love this one! It’s super cute, sleek and the lights are so pretty. The clicks are quiet like it says in the description and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a mouse.",2021,01
"This mouse is sleek, slim, and so pretty! I love the lights! The battery goes pretty quick when using the light changing setting, but has a lower setting it lasts quite a while. Would definitely recommend it!",2021,01
"I like this mouse.  The light colors constantly scroll through a rainbow and aren't static on just one color.  My office is in my bedroom, and if I leave the mouse on, it makes a great nightlight -- not too bright, but just light enough to find my way around if I wake up during the night.  I especially love the fact that it's rechargeable and that I haven't had to put any batteries in it since I bought it several months ago.The thing I don't like is that it has a tendency to do its own thing sometimes.  If I'm working on the couch and put the mouse down next to me (flat and completely still, not rolling backwards or moving at all) the cursor on the screen will sometimes take off at a diagonal, stuttering its way up and across the screen.  At other times, I will be using the mouse to click and drag something or draw a line and the cursor will suddenly jump to a completely different part of the screen, or it will ""hiccup"" and lose the hold on what I was clicking and dragging or cause the line to wobble (sometimes quite sharply, kind of like trying to draw a straight line in the car when the tire hits a pothole).It's a good little mouse, and aside from the spastic glitches, I'm pleased with it, but I am getting tired of not having full control right when I need it most.  I may keep this one for its nightlight capabilities and shop for another rechargeable mouse to use with my computer.",2021,01
It does not work and I have tried to reach the seller. Instructions in chinese and simply poor poor service. Purchase at own peril. great disappointment for my kid.,2021,01
"it was going well for a few weeks then, my son dropped his MacBook and the usb type-c connected BROKE! its so easy to break and I would not recommend",2021,01
"My daughter needed a wireless mouse for her laptop. I came across this one and bought it for it's cool features, size, and price. It is so smooth and she loves using it along with that fact that it lights up; goes with her LED lights in her room. You won't be disappointed with this mouse.",2021,01
"I really like how sleek this mouse is, it extremely functional and the lights add a cool “futuristic” type of vibe making my experience enjoyable every time. Another neat function is the silent clicker, I work early mornings so to not wake up my family with the constant clicking of a noisy mouse is definitely a luxury. I’m happy with my purchase.",2021,01
Like,2021,01
"Absolutely nothing i disliked about this product. Its better than advertised - only thing is it looks as though it was made in China, yeech. But it is a very good product, going to get another one",2021,01
Easy to use,2021,01
"This is the coolest mouse I’ve ever had. Sleek, modern, high tech and sexy lights! Everything. Slips in my briefcase with my new ultra thin laptop. Sweet!!",2021,01
I purchased the rose gold and it matches my Airbook 13. Charges fast and lasts a long time between charges. Glad I bought this wireless mouse. I use it for 8 hrs a day 5 days a week.,2021,01
"The mouse is a colorful addition to my desk and, unlike other computer mice I have owned, it does NOT have thumb-operated controls on its left side, where a left-handed person like myself would unintentionally press a button and start a function they didn't want to activate.  I've only had it for about a week, so it remains to be seen how frequently it needs to be recharged; the light display draws a significant amount of power, so I need to remember to turn the mouse off whenever I shut down the PC.",2021,01
Love it,2021,01
" The black feels super soft. I just plugged it into my USB-C on my computer. It also comes with a USB adapter Incase you don’t have that. Left and right button clicks softy not annoyingly. Middle scroll works great, the click is a bit louder and it won’t click onto a document so that click that doesn’t do anything. Happy with this purchase, it looks great at night and it’s such a gamer / music producer look.",2021,01
"great mouse for price, thought it was bluetooth, but its not. still good though",2021,01
We tried several different ways to charge it and it would not hold a charge over 30 minutes. :(,2022,10
It is sleek and I like the fact that I can charge it on my computer. It does light up and it works great. After sitting for a while the mouse needs to wake up by pressing the right click.,2021,01
"Some of the reviews on how this mouse did not work after the first use caused me apprehension, but given the price, I took the risk.  It is just what I needed, and it is really pretty as well.  Great product.",2021,01
Purchased as a gift for my nephew. He really likes it.,2021,01
"3 month update: This thing squeals now! It took me a week to figure out why I kept hearing a high pitched whine every time I moved my cursor, and eventually I realized that something inside the mouse is creating a very high pitched squeal every time I move it -- that, on top of the mouse dying in about a day of use now, means that this thing is a no-go. Definitely buy something else, this thing has been a total headache since I got it.The battery on this mouse doesn't seem to last a very long time, after about two days of usage it'll die. I find myself plugging it in every night to make sure I don't have to deal with that.Additionally, the thing goes to sleep after about a minute or two without movement -- super annoying, you have to click the mouse to wake it up again, and doing so registers a click wherever your mouse was left on screen before it went to sleep. Can't recommend it for any type of work that requires small periods of typing or reading, you'll end up waking up the mouse from its weird sleep about a million times.",2021,01
My mouse decided to stop working and forced me to have to get a new one. I found this one and thought I would give it a try. I am so glad that I did. It's sleek and stylish and I love that it lights up. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a sleek and fun mouse.,2021,01
"Love this mouse. Makes my productivity rate hight while using my laptop and glad the light doesn't have to be on, because it can be very distracting.",2021,01
Item received Charger Does not work,2021,01
I used this once and when it died I charged it for a few days and it still won’t work.,2021,01
"This is an excellent product. It’s lightweight, has a very smooth rolling actio , and I LOVE the way it looks!!! I highly recommend this mouse!!!!!",2021,01
It only worked for 1 month. Do not recommend.,2021,01
The metal casing for the USB remote came  off and is now stuck  in the USB port of my computer,2021,01
"First, the left mouse click is not sensitive enough, requiring a longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click. Annoying, and I'm betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder/longer. Another less significant annoyance: make sure you don't turn on the light feature. It looks cool, but the thing acts like a lava light night light, continually changing colors of light even when not in use (even with the computer off), which will run down the battery. I like the rechargeable feature, but I will be looking for another mouse.",2021,01
The mouse is sleek and comfortable. I enjoy the sleep mode because I am terrible about turning off my mouse when I'm not using. Setup is simple since it has an adapter.,2021,01
Got it for my wife she seems to like it it looks nice and feels good in hand.,2021,01
"I love this mouse , I've had others before  but never like this , it was so easy to connect,  just  plug in the USB connector and thats it , no drivers to install  or to download  , works  right out the box .. its so natural  when using  this mouse  , I even used it when I was in the coach and it worked perfectly on the arm rest , I would  recommend this all day , good product..",2021,01
 I was in the market for a new mouse as my Logitech wireless was going bad on me. I was red to stay wireless and had a budget. The Logitech and other named brands were just too expensive when I wanted one that looked cool. And the cheaper ones were too normal looking. I got this one as it was cheap and the led lights were a cool feature. I got it and it feels great. It feels like an apple mouse and the buttons were really quiet and didn’t have the typical mouse click sound.Edit: I had to get a other mouse as my first broke. It was completely my fault as it had fell and was stepped on by accident. Since it was so cheap I just bought another and it works as well as the first.,2021,01
Very smooth use love the different colors.,2021,01
Lasted 4 months,2021,01
"Hi,I have purchased this product for my daughter, so happy with the overall looks and performance. I will recommend you to buy... great buy.",2021,01
"The mouse only works if directly next to the usb port it is plugged into, so it is useless if using it a foot below (on a keyboard tray).  The instructions are not in english to try and troubleshoot.",2021,01
"Love it. It fits my hand, just right. Only issue is that it came in another language..",2021,01
I have been needing a wireless mouse for the longest and this product was definitely what i was looking for. Nice sleek feel and has a long battery life so I'm glad I bought it.,2021,01
Everything went smoothly! The mouse looks awesome and works perfect!,2021,01
"Decent while it worked ( though waking from sleep required switching it off & back on underneath ). The laser stopped working ( fully charged up ), only color lights work, making it useless.",2021,01
This mouse is perfect!I bought it to match with my keynote light up keyboard and it matches better than I expected. The colors change while gaming just as my keyboard does and it works perfectly for gaming and normal day-to-day use.Would buy again.,2021,01
This mouse worked one time and hasn't worked since. I have tried charging it and flipping it to different settings. It lights up and that is all that it does.,2021,01
"I'm not rating this one star because it is a cute mouse and I like the design. For some reason, I found my MacBook trackpad more comfortable to use than this mouse. My wrists were hurt within a couple hours of using this mouse. That being said, I used it in moderation. I wanted to like it. However, I received this mouse January 4th. As of January 31, responsiveness has gone downhill. After taking it off the charger (it has a short battery life), it takes about 30 seconds and moving the scroll wheel for it to respond again. Even then, it might have some hard to ignore hiccups.",2021,01
i have one and my grandson liked it so i got him one for his birthday,2021,01
"For $10, you are better off getting a wired mouse. This thing is so bad, the sensor light bleeds through the top  shell of the mouse. Worse is that the actual functionality is very poor, if your are looking for an accurate mouse, this is not it. I have a multi colored mouse pad and the sensor struggles between the change in shades making this mouse difficult to use. If you have a plain color mouse pad this may be acceptable, but if your on the go, this will not do.",2021,01
"Highly recommend, silent click is great. You have the option to turn off the color changing mode.",2021,01
Would recommend and would buy again.,2021,01
"Easy to setup, just plug in the USB and it works. Smooth cursor movement and clicking, but the wheel does not scroll very well. Only moves the screen a few lines and then it quits scrolling all together.",2021,01
"Great so far, I use it for my MacBook Pro and I'm really enjoying it. Great touch and super lightweight.",2021,01
Super quiet! You just don't hear any clicks.  Love that it is rechargeable instead of replacing batteries. I have had it for weeks and I have only charged it twice.,2021,01
Great mouse,2021,01
"I really enjoy the feel of the mouse, it's slick which has put less strain on my wrist but I'll still be getting a wrist support. The colors don't need to be turned on and when left in middle, it keeps the mouse on with only the red light from underneath.",2021,01
"Could use an instruction sheet.  Also, what is the expected battery life on a single charge.”?",2021,01
I love the color and the light the most. It’s so easy to use and the best part is not having to download drivers.,2021,01
"I am old school when it comes to navigating the screen.  I work much faster with a wireless mouse.  Everything about this mouse is great EXCEPT you gotta to charge it.  Mouse that require batteries work for a very long time. Months in fact.  The charge on this mouse doesn't last long.  I have to remember to turn it off when I'm not using it.  I also have to remember to plug it into charge after long use.  Starts acting sluggish as power runs down.  My old mouse is 15 years old.  I wanted a cool new one to match my new laptop.  This one has a soft smooth click.  The LED lights are really fun.  However, I threw away the box before I tried it out.  I would send it back if I had kept shipping material.  I'll just keep the old one close when the new one is charging.  So much for progress.i",2021,01
I made sure that this product was gonna be a good one and i was not disapointed. It's silent click which is nice. The lights look awesome on it. It was just worth it.,2021,01
WENT THROUGH BATTERYS LIKE CRAZY . AND DID NOT LAST LONG .I WAS DISAPOINTEDIT IN IT,2021,01
"It took less than a day for the receiver to fall apart in my usb port, now the shell is stuck and I have to take my computer to get it pulled out.",2021,01
I love the lights and the easy set up.,2021,01
"UPDATE: I have upped my review from 2 to 3 since I reached out to the seller and they offered to send a replacement USB dongle. Will update the review again once that has been received. **I would have given this mouse five stars a month ago, but yesterday when I removed the USB dongle from my laptop the thing fell apart in my hands and the mouse is now worthless. I tried to piece it back together but it won't stay together. It's a shame because this mouse is really cool looking, feels nice in my hand, and holds a charge a long time. Very disappointed!",2021,01
"This is a very user friendly modle.  Very light weight, silent, rechargable, and easy to move around.  Just one suggestion, it will be better if the instruction has English version.",2021,01
"This item is very good.  I haven't used it enough to determine the capacity of the battery, but I'm happy with it so far.",2021,01
Needed a mouse for my laptop. Lights are awesome.,2021,01
Works great,2021,01
I bought this for my daughter who received a new laptop for Christmas.  She loves the led lights.  It was easy to set up and use.  Works wonderfully.,2021,01
"I bought this mouse because mine went bellyup.  I am thoroughly pleased with this one.  It's easy to use, easy to charge (a plus) and a all around nice mouse and YES, I'd buy it again!!!",2021,01
It’s wireless but not Bluetooth very misleading as it was  recommended with the other mice that was. A total waste of money but fits nicely in your palm with small hands.,2021,01
Stopped working after a week even if I plugged it into the computer,2021,01
I love it!,2021,01
"pretty good for price, works",2021,01
Soo cute!!! Very sleek design.  I love that it came with the Type C attachment.  I have a new laptop that doesn't have USB ports.  Oh yea!! The rose gold color matches my laptop perfectly!!! The color changing lights around thw mouse are to die for.... very cool feature,2021,01
"was very hard to click,not worth $ 15",2021,01
"This is an awesome little mouse; connection was super easy, it’s quiet(as a mouse) and compared to my last mouse, silent ❤️. The buttons work great, it feels really smooth and I think the size is perfect for me :)",2021,01
"My old mouse needed 2 AA batteries and they always needed changing because it didn't sleep. This mouse is awesome. Holds a good charge, falls asleep, mulitple dpi and cool lights too. I should have gotten this sooner!",2021,01
Beautiful wireless mouse. Makes a day in the office brighter,2021,01
Truly amazing product,2021,01
" Love this mouse; and I don’t believe I have ever said that.  Great economic shape, love the color, and the light feature  is almost mesmerizing... AND rechargeable!",2021,01
Goes through batteries like water,2021,01
"Is almost tiny for my hands and very light. Works so good and decently priced I'll learn to use it for surfing the web. Yet let me mention it seems the curve under shape is fine for my thumb side, but the pinky finger side is going to take some getting used to. Many times my pinky then fingers slide right under it or lift it off the surface slightly no matter how gentle I think I'm holding it.  In the past I've had taller models that have a flair formed to keep the fingers in position. In construction using stuff that requires a good grip, makes this like using a feather I barely feel. Makes me wonder how it would be for gaming if you got excitement and need to make a lot fast moves. Elves would love this thing though and it scrolls and moves around so good, I may even make a flange for my fingers and to give it some weight without an old fashioned battery weighing it down. It is cool with the lights no joke,  a good choice since many look just like this and perhaps everybody else has more grip control, lol, yet thank you, I found another fun product on Amazon again.",2021,01
"I purchased this mouse for my chromebook which only has a mousepad. I enjoy that it really lights up. It is lightweight and an easy glide finish. It's wireless and rechargable. The wireless adapter fits in the bottom of the mouse. So, you don't lose it.",2021,01
I absolutely love this mouse!! It’s so quiet and I love the different color lights as I use it. I salís like how comfortable it is to use. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.,2021,01
love this mouse havent had to charge it at all since i got it amazing,2021,01
Wish you could select the color of the rgb light. It just cycles through all of them. Nothing in the instructions so it must only cycle. Besides that it’s nice. Super quiet click. Clicking the scroll wheel is loud and hard though.,2021,01
"The right click button stopped working within a few weeks.  Troubleshot by reboot , control panel settings, and even  recharge overnight.  No luck.",2021,01
 Although it's pretty it works great and I love the colors I got it for asthetics but it's very functional I work at home 8 hours a day and the charge is lasting quite long.,2021,01
"I have many wireless mouses (mice?) trying to find the right one for my home office/studio.  I bought this one for the slim design in the matte black finish.  It arrived and I have never used a mouse that's this quiet before, it's insane.  It feels great when I use it, it's smooth and very ergonomic.  This was definitely worth the price, and I may replace my other wireless devices with this model!",2021,01
Best mouse I’ve ever bought so glad I got it perfect for my job.,2021,01
The top is not opaque like the photos. It's translucent. There is only one lighting mode. There is no rainbow effect on the edge like the photo.,2021,01
It's cheap. My right click requires more Force than my left. The LEDs aren't that vibrant. Not ergonomic. It's a decent mouse but I wouldn't recommend it for gaming.,2021,01
"The calibration on this is terrible. I can’t even use it. It goes all over the place, doesn’t go where im directing it to go. I make calls for work on my computer and it’s hung up when I was clearly going to the opposite side of the screen. It’s terrible.",2021,01
The battery life on it is crap. You have to recharge it every few hours. It’s not worth the hassle. When it’s charged it also has some pretty bad lag or just doesn’t move the cursor the way you move the mouse.,2021,01
Granddaughter likes the lights,2021,01
you get about 8 hours use time on this and then you have to charge it up separately. Not worth the trouble.,2021,01
"The mouse lasts a good while on a charge, as it shuts itself off.A good product.",2021,01
"Stopped working after a few days of use on a brand new laptop. Will turn on, but does not function properly/lags.However great the first few days.",2021,01
"It doesn't have a tail, so it's more of a hamster, but it is a very nice hamster! It lights up really nicely and it is very accurate control of the cursor. I can't speak on it for gaming as I only use it for working from home, but I did like it enough to buy one for my work desk as well. Obviously, 10/10, did indeed by it again!",2021,01
 Small. Lightweight. Charged pretty fast and lasted quite a while. Perfect for what we need! I recommend!,2021,01
the pictures aren't accurate. It only lights up and changes as solid colors,2021,01
My daughter love the mouse.,2021,01
Don’t bother doesn’t work,2021,01
So I really like it. I like you can shut of the lights if you want.  It is sensitive so your mouse moves very easily and it's very easy for a person who has a laptop.,2021,01
Second one. Same issue.  The mouse wheel just stops working.  Do not order this product learn from my mistakes.,2022,09
"I use this mouse for work and it holds up for 8 hrs. It doesn’t take long to charge, and the changing colors is a plus! Glad I purchased",2021,01
"This is a great little mouse. It is small, responsive and I love the way the light changes colors. My hand is more relaxed when I'm using it than with my previous mouse. I have had no issues with it so far. Overall, based upon my experience thus far, this was a good purchase and I would buy it again.",2021,01
"I only used it once until it was dead and then I charged for hours, it wouldn't even turn on. So in all the charging feature does not work. :( It was a cute mouse though, but it doesn't work.",2021,01
"I did not like that it made a very faint squealing noise. The colors are pretty and the clicks are quiet. But everytime the mouse moves, you can hair a high pitch noise. The instructions were all in a foreign language as well",2021,01
" UPDATE to prior review: This mouse started out great, was so excited about it at first. Then after a couple months in, all of the sudden, the usb that goes into the computer just snaps/breaks. And, I'll add I did nothing to it. One day while working from home I moved the laptop to start work and noticed the mouse wasn't functioning. I looked to see why, then saw the usb had just cratered into a couple pieces. So now I paid $16 for nothing! Good Lord my own money too, not something my office will reimburse me for either. Nice work.",2021,01
"Clicking this mouse takes so much force I have to physically move my arm to get the leverage to do it. And if I ever pick the mouse up off the pad, my cursor moves erratically around, even if it's pointed at the ceiling.Literally the 2 most important things for a mouse: pointing and clicking, are useless on this thing.Looks nice, though.",2021,01
"On my laptop, it skips/doesn’t read about 10% of the time, making it unusable for gaming or pretty much anything that requires quick response time. I tried it on several types of mouse pads and surfaces, and it does the same no matter what.",2021,01
"VERY DISAPPOINTED I RECEVIED THIS ITEM DECEMBER 27TH , I UNOXED IT ON DECEMBER 30TH. TODAY IS JAN 20TH AND THE MOUSE STOP WORKING .",2021,01
"Not a fan. Wouldn’t sync with one computer. Worked great with the other computer, but it didn’t “sleep” when I was done with it. So the next day, the battery was dead. I’ll never remember to turn off the mouse when I’m not using it, so this is not going to be very useful.",2021,01
"Works great, just feels a little flimsy so I'm not sure how it will hold up.  I suppose it's a good value for the price.  The slowly changing colored LED lights are pretty cool.  I like that, unlike the Apple Magic Mouse, you can use this mouse while it is charging. The seller extended the warranty another 6 months after I registered it, so that gives me a little more confidence in the quality (or at least the customer service).I was compensated by the seller for this review with a refund of the purchase price of the mouse.",2021,01
The Mouse Is AMAZING You Can Pick Out Diff Colors And i LOVE How It Glows Rainbow Greatest Purchase Ever!!,2021,01
Love it and the colors❣️,2021,01
"Really like array of colors so I purchased mouse for every day workflow not gaming. The scroll wheel is a bit squeaky, that’s the only flaw. Not sure if I will keep it or put in ‘file 13’.",2021,01
"No stars will be given, this item holds no charge and interferes with the rest of my computer. This item is not useable it trusted",2021,01
"I originally ordered the white version but when I got it, I realized it was see-through. I asked the shop owner whether this was just an issue with the version I ordered or what all the white mouses look like. They’re all white, according to the shop. Because I raised concern, they were so kind to ship a different color to me free of charge. I didn’t even have to return the original!",2020,12
This mouse works excellent. It’s easy to move. Very lightweight. I love the way it lights up. Excellent buy.,2020,12
It works great. Fits my hand great. Only thing is the lights don’t work at efficiently. Happy with the product overall.,2020,12
If you need a mouse just for making your life easier while working with spread sheets or any other microsoft office tool this is perfect. I'm not quite sure how comfortable this would be for gaming though.,2020,12
No instructions in English. Sleep mode??? No ideaWorks fine and the color changing is cute,2020,12
"Using the type c port as its plug-in method does not work. While plugged in, my computer does not detect or accept the plug-in. If this is your main use in mind, do not use it.",2020,12
I really liked everything about this product!!,2020,12
it's easy to use and works well there is no loud clicking when using it. to get it to change colors you must push the on button all the way up to the top. and it changes color when you touch it which I find pretty cool,2020,12
This came with an c3 charging attachment but why? This uses a normal cell phone charger port. And all the intuitions are in Chinese. Theres a random button at the top and when I press it Nothing happens. And I dont know how to tell how much charge there is on it. Other than that I really like it so far. Its very sleek.,2020,12
This mouse is very sleek and comfortable to use. The click is very quiet. I highly recommend for the price!,2020,12
The LED lights are pretty but otherwise this mouse is not responding well and overall does not handle too well. I am disappointed and would not buy it again.,2020,12
The wheel button feels like it requires 5x the force to activate and makes 10x the noise of the other 2 buttons. Whoever approved this should be fired straight into the sun. The wheel button gets more use in CAD software than any other button and not even 5 minutes of use and the wrist is already strained to the point where I can not continue to work.,2020,11
"I was skeptical at first that such a small ergonomic mouse would work, I’m pleasantly surprised and have really enjoyed using it. I forgot to recharge it but it lets you know before it goes out by slowing down or moving from one screen to my other. I got it plugged in immediately and it kept right on working while it charged. I highly recommend this Mouse and plan on buying another to have as a backup for when I forget to charge. I really love the color changing sequence the colors are bright but not overly so just enough to make it fun.",2020,12
I use this with my macbook pro and its a good eye catcher when I'm djing.,2020,12
"This mouse is very quiet, just as advertised.  I was shocked at the lack of ""clicking"" when you push the right or left side.  That was my main push to purchase, besides the cool colors and LED lights.  I must say those are just an aestetic  bonus, but it kind of makes working fun.  This mouse is plastic, so the ""gold"" tone you see is gold plastic and the underbelly is white plastic.  It charges fast and it responds just as quickly as my older battery powered wireless mouse.  Overall, this mouse is really great.  I am glad I bought it and if you are sitting on the fence, just go ahead and get it.",2020,12
Really great for the mouse really light and wow just passed my expectations would buy again.,2020,12
USB got stuck and broke inside my computer,2020,12
The mouse was shipped fast and the packaging was in good condition. The pairing was fast and easy. I spent $100.00 on a razer mouse with the same functions and lighting it broke in six months! I'm very happy with my purchase.,2020,12
Love this: it feels like an extension of my hand!,2020,12
This broke after 1 day.,2020,12
Works great! And looks classy!,2020,12
"It's cute I guess. It is pretty cheaply made. You can just tell by the feel of it. I got the matte black one. It charges pretty fast and lasts for hours on one charge. I love the nano USB plug. It came with a cord, but I just use my phone charger. It does change colors and also has the option of turning the colors off with the little button on the bottom. The instructions are all in Chinese, but using it is pretty easy. The nano fits in a little spot under the mouse for storage and also comes with an adapter. It is quite flat, so not the best for long term use like with gaming. I'll keep it, but wouldn't purchase it again for the price.Update:I have used this cheap little mouse for HOURS every night since I got it. I've only had to charge it maybe once a week. The charge is phenomenal. Still works perfectly!!",2020,12
"I wanted a wireless mouse and this one fit my needs. It is rechargeable and can be turned off which helps save battery power. It can also be used while the charging cable is plugged in if necessary. The colors are a great touch and I use them depending on the mood I'm in at the time.  I also like being able to choose the resolution ""on the fly"" with the button on the top. I have already recommended it to a couple of friends.",2020,12
The mouse looks nice HOWEVER the instructions are in Chinese.I struggled with connecting but once I figured it out its working awesome so far. I will do an update in a few months.So far so good!!,2020,12
For gaming and sleep mode helps out a lot in college,2020,12
"its so cute, slim and pretty.",2020,12
Great product for the price...my daughter loves it! It is so quiet when you're clicking the buttons that you can hear it at all so I have decided to purchase myself one as well!,2020,12
"This mouse is amazing. I work in IT and have been working from home for quite some time. There are days where I have to work 10-12 hours. My hand does not get tired at all when using this mouse for long periods of time. It is super easy to setup...just connect to the USB and you’re done. The BEST part that I love about this mouse is that it is superrrrrrrrrr quiet! The weeks that I’m on-call, I do not have to feel discouraged and walking on eggshells when I have to respond to an urgent matter in the middle of the night and having to risk waking up my partner with the continuous mouse clicking sound. I will definitely buy another one just in case if I lose it.",2020,12
"If you are looking for a mouse that is small and slim, pretty color and one that lights up, this one does all of that and it is quiet.While the little booklet is in a foreign languageI am satisfied with my purchase and even though the seller offered,  no refund is necessary.",2020,12
Very cute but the cursor for the mouse didn’t work. All other buttons worked thou,2020,12
"Pros: matte feel, slim profile, quiet clickCons: instructions were in another language so there wasn't any information on how to set up (I guessed), came with a scratch on it, track wheel DOES NOT WORK!!",2020,12
"There's nothing majorly, egregiously wrong with this mouse but it doesn't necessarily excel at anything. The mouse is pretty light, the buttons are reasonably clicky and responsive. The sleep mode is a bit aggressive, and I find myself often annoyed with how quickly the mouse goes to sleep and I have to wait for it to reconnect before using it again.The DPI is by far the biggest problem, it doesn't feel like the DPI switch on the mouse actually does anything, and it almost feels like the DPI changes randomly while in use. I've noticed this behavior with a mouse mat, and on a flat desk alone. This may be just my unit but beware it nonetheless.Overall, it's definitely good enough for what I needed - a cheap, wireless, rechargeable mouse that is passable for office work, however I wouldn't use it for anything beyond that.",2020,12
"Sweet sleek mouse with nice color, can't wait till its nighttime to show it off",2020,12
"I like how smooth it is. It moves across the screen easily.  The buttons click nicely. My hand doesn't hurt after hours of gaming.  The sleep mode is a great perk to save charging time.  Overall one of the best purchases I've made for myself in a long time,",2020,12
My son has been using this for school for just under a month and the USB has stopped registering so it can't be used anymore,2022,11
"I got a new MacBook Air and I wanted a wireless mouse to go with it. I found this one and liked the color-changing lights, so I bought it and received it quicker than expected, and am enjoying it. It has a rechargeable battery, so no changing batteries, which I also like. I plugged it in and it worked immediately, the only thing I would change at this point is the connector. The USB connector is standard, but it has to be plugged into another connector to use it with the USB-C connector, which is all the new MacBook has, and it sticks out an inch and a half.Overall, I am pleased with the mouse and its lights, and it works as expected.",2020,12
"Stopped working, very disappointed.  Was enjoying using the mouse. Working from home and only used for that purpose.  Charged every 2 days. Very disappointed, the lifespan was short.1.30.2021 Review update  on product: Very happy with the customer service.  They reached out and provided a refund. Customer service goes a long way, when you receive services or products.  Having great customer service make you more confident in the company, due to nothing is perfect.",2020,12
Left it on overnight and then tried to charge it up for work...Now it doesn't work,2020,12
it's not what i expected but it work,2020,12
At first I was happy with the product but now when I try to click links I have to press super hard to get it to work.  Will probably return it.,2020,12
"The description says that it is C adapter for Macbook Air. This is NOT true. You have to plug C adapter into laptop and then the USB wireless tab into the adapter. Had I know I had to use an adapter, I would not have bought this. Can not return as I need it now. Very disappointed.",2020,12
Never worked had to return. It wouldn’t connect after charging 5x,2020,12
"It works well, lights up very pretty, rechargeable, very quiet",2020,12
It’s good,2020,12
My daughter loves it. No complaints here.,2020,12
This mouse was terrible.  It worked very inconsistently and I have already replaced it with one that actually works.It was very disappointing.,2020,12
"Clicks are very Smooth and responds Great , Plus you never need BatteriesJust what I was looking for & at a reasonable Price",2020,12
 So it’s extra light easy to work and I love it for the price no pesky batteries,2020,12
"OMG this is literally one of the best mouse I've used in quite a while: I previously was using a small HP mouse and it gave me hand cramps over time. However, since switching, this mouse has revived my fingertips to give me better mobility as I complete my college assignments, or even surf the web.",2020,12
Works great,2020,12
Its lightweight. I absolutely love the changing colors.,2020,12
"My sister loves her mouse, she uses it with her laptop.",2020,11
"I use this mouse for casual surfing and scrolling, no gaming but it’s smooth and responsive and looks awesome.",2020,11
"I BOUGHT THIS MOUSE FOR BOTH MY 11 YEAR OLD BOY WHO IS A GAMER AND MY 6 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO WE JUST BOUGHT A GAMER COMPUTER FOR. SO FAR, THIS MOUSE IS AWESOME. WE LOVE THE LIGHT-UP OPTION ON THE MOUSE. IT ENHANCES THE GAMING EXPERIENCE. THE MOUSE IS LIGHTWEIGHT AND WORKS GREAT IN TERMS OF FUNCTIONALITY. SO GLAD I BOUGHT IT!",2020,11
"Mouse works good so far. Only thing that is disappointing is when I put the switch to the color setting it starts to change colors but also stops working. While its on the ""On"" position it lights up red which is better than nothing at least.",2020,11
"The dpi sensor stopped working after a couple of days, don’t buy it",2020,11
Great,2020,11
"I just got the mouse today and so far so good. It didn’t take long to fully charge . It’s sleek , lightweight & Love the different colors that it alternates. One of the best things is that the clicking sound of the mouse is not even noticeable. It’s super quiet.",2020,11
Works great! Lights are not too bright. Goes great with the gaming pad!,2020,11
"no complaints with this purchase, slim design makes it easy to pack and go",2020,11
"1) When I opened my mouse, I noticed there were scratches on the top of the mouse, towards the area where your palm would rest when in use. I also noticed that the adapter that arrived with the mouse did not fit the USB that would make the mouse compatible with my MacBook, so I had to use a different adapter. Considering I paid for a NEW $14 mouse, I was expecting to get better quality.2) Gave the mouse a second chance and this time I received one that didn't work.",2020,11
Broke after 5 days... wheel broke and went down into the mouse and doesn’t work. Wouldn’t recommend it’s cheap for a reason. I knew I shouldn’t have bought anything other than a Logitech!,2020,11
I love it! The colors make me happy it’s so comfortable to use!!,2020,11
I love the color options. It's very sleek and feels good in the hand. Battery life is also a plus. My kid uses it to game and for school. Been using it daily since Christmas and only charged it once. I definitely recommend.,2020,11
Disliked,2020,11
Started out and I loved this mouse butwithin 2 months it would not hold a charge for more tha a few hours.Annoying having to use it plugged in. I bought this for the convenience of only having to rechage every couple of days to this in unacceptable. If it was even once a day I could handle it since I like the mouse but can't stand charging every few hours. So sad.,2020,11
"This mouse was driving me crazy at first in that I thought it wasn't working. But it had gone into its 'sleep mode'. Just give it a click to wake it up. Now that I know that, it works great. Go figure... user error.",2022,11
"The good thing is this mouse is cheap, but it feels like it too.  The wheel is terrible and the buttons are not even or flush and when moving from the wheel to the buttons your finger catches on the button.  other than feeling really cheaply made it functions as it should",2020,11
"Very good mouse, excellent",2020,11
"I bought it for work. It's so smooth, color is a matte black. LED lights are so cool and fun. Doesn't make any clicking sound. Is rechargeable. I'm very happy with this purchase.",2020,11
"If you get a white mouse, be prepared that you could get one that actually looks solid like it should or transparent like the one I got. I guess sure it's pretty interesting that instead of only the perimeter of the mouse lighting up, the entire thing does. But at the same time, it takes the focus away from the design for the rgb. It makes the mouse look cheap, being able to see the skeleton of the plastic's interior. It even feels like a $7 mouse. It's only doubled the price tag bc of 2 obvious-to-see rgb leds. I would've liked it more if the leds at least blended colors, but with an obvious wall of plastic in the way, they don't even do that.Despite its looks, the mouse worked great for a couple days. The movement felt smooth, the clicking felt good and it was quiet. I noticed the red laser id not shielded at all. Also, the rgb lights stay on even when the mouse falls asleep. And unfortunately after a few days, I noticed the movement isn't very good. It may be okay for normal use but it's not acceptable for gaming. I thought it was because of the low battery power, but even at full power and changing the dpi around, the issue remains. This is gonna have to be returned.",2020,11
This mouse is awesome.  Its sleek and it works so well.  It also looks great!,2020,11
"I purchased one of these before and it was really nice .I like the way it looks and feels it's pretty accurate and has a good sensitivity and this one I got a card in it that said I get this one for free I don't know how,.  cuz I can't read Chinese and the instructions are in Chinese.!",2020,11
" I like it, easy to use and carry around if needed. The box comes with a nice short charging cord and a USB --> USB C adapter for use with either the Bluetooth receiver or the charging cord. Nice addition that's come in handy. I don't like how long it takes for it to wake up, though. Not sure what the time frame is on when it goes to sleep, but if I'm reading something or just have my computer on for a video or music, I just turn the mouse off all together. It's quicker to just flick it back on than it is to jiggle it around to wake it. Rainbow colors are fun, holds a charge for a long time. I can work pretty much the whole week before noticing its lagging and probably could use a charge. This makes it a lot friendlier to use over batteries. I'll take the sluggish sleep mode over the clunky mouse styles with repeat battery replacements. Good find for the money!",2020,11
"its so quiet and you dont have to click so hard, its going to save me from Arthiritus",2020,11
I got to use it for one day. Better to get one from walmart.,2020,11
"its quiet, smooth, simple to use, conveinent.",2020,11
I really like the rechargeable feature. Instead of going thru all the batteries.,2020,11
"This is really a ball to use. It does exactly what the description says: change colors slowly and continuously. Also it has two modes: color change, or battery-saving single color. But the battery lasts for hours and it is as easy to recharge as a cellphone. In fact, you can plug it into a USB outlet on your laptop or whatever and it will charge in no time. The only problem I have with it is that, occasionally, the cursor on my laptop will jump from one side of the screen to the other, or from bottom to top, etc. I have no idea why that happens, and it can be annoying, which is why 4 stars instead of 5.",2020,11
came with a big scratch.,2020,11
Received with everything shown. Even came charged and ready for use! I gave this to my boyfriend for Christmas and it was a great gift. It can be used from far away (for when your laptop is connected to the TV through the HDMI cord) with no problem.,2020,11
Works Great,2020,11
 So cute and very easy to use!!! I really recommend it!Battery last long!,2020,11
I like the movement of the mouse. I have bought two of them because of price and needed both for two of my computers. Great Wireless mouse with added bonus of Color LED's which change,2020,11
Excellent using for exam practice and love the lights! Great product!,2020,11
This little mouse is great! No need to use batteries. Connection was easy peasy,2020,11
Great wireless mouse. Use it on my new HP stream laptop it does great. It’s light weight and easy to use. The lights on it are cool too.,2020,11
"I like that this mouse has rechargeable feature, which makes it super lightweight and slim that makes super easy to carry. Color options are nice as well. I would definitely recommend this one!",2020,11
I got this and loved it at first.  It fit great to the hand and was very quiet.  But it wouldn't keep charged.  it would only work for 1-2 days then i had to recharge it,2020,11
It’s colorful and works great.,2020,11
"Sleek, attractive and the color change option is beautiful.  You can keep solid red, or let the colors rotate.",2020,11
The mouse feels alright in hand but mine has an issue of pulling the cursor to the top left. Looks of the mouse are good though and the lights are subtle yet cool.,2020,11
Very easy to set up and use. I love it,2020,11
Good in battery saving.  Automatically gets in sleep mode if not used. This saves battery.,2020,11
"I believe this is a great purchase, the size is not too small and not too large, its shape is thin but comfortable. The lighting is glamorous. I do use it on my laptop at home, about 3x a week, because of this, I shut the mouse off to save on the charge. But, I have to say that the charge does hold for a long time.  If you forget, a cord is provided and it measures about 10'' long, which is perfect to plug in and continue to use the mouse as you work.  The price is reasonable and worth it. I would like to purchase another for work, but fear that its projected beauty may peek someone's interest.",2020,11
"I got this specifically since it was smaller than the gaming mouse I had, this slim mouse feels nicer in my hand. The only thing is that occasionally the cursor lags/jumps a bit but it doesn’t happen too often. Otherwise I love that it’s chargeable and wireless. I don’t keep the flashy lights on too often to conserve the battery. Nice cheap mouse.",2020,11
Such a cool mouse.  surprisingly good (especially for the pricepoint),2020,11
"I pruchased this because since working from home I have become so tired of all the  wires from mouse. Not only is this a great price, but I plugged it in, charged it from the box and it started working perfectly. It is smaller than my older mouse but I like it! It is silent and feels nice in my hand.",2020,11
I got this mouse for my 9 year daughter for Christmas. She loves how it fits her hands and how is changes colors. What she likes the most is how quiet it is when clicking the button the family wireless mouse is a bit loud when clicked. She will be using it for school and her Chromebook. Not really a gaming mouse and there is only 2 buttons and a wheel.,2020,11
"Kind of flaky. Sometimes it lights up and other times...,,",2020,11
I ordered this wireless mouse for wife's new Windows laptop. Works well and easy to use. It uses a small USP insert in the computer to communicate.,2020,11
This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter to accompany her new laptop. She loved it and the color coordinated very well with her computer and other accessories.  I am very pleased with the item.,2020,10
Doesn't track with with or without the cable. Do not purchase.,2020,10
"I love this wireless mouse! It’s super cute, modern and goes perfect with my MacBook. Love the colored lights as well. And it’s fast!",2020,10
"I know it’s lame, but I don’t like that it looks like it lights up in multi color but it doesn’t.  It’s red when it’s on and blue when it’s charging.  Kind of a bummer",2020,10
Smooth and comfortable..like the feel of ease while using .. definitely recommend this mouse,2020,10
This mouse feels and looks very good!! As a cool affordable mouse I recommend it to anyone looking to buy a rgb wireless mouse.,2020,10
"Don’t expect the Bluetooth to work, it didn’t work for my device’s but it works as a mouse tried it gaming not the best recommend spending the extra cash for a good gaming mouse but if you need or want a mouse for clicking and dragging go ahead but the lights don’t turn off and again the Bluetooth didn’t work for me it might work for you, who knows.",2020,10
Cute and functional.  I bought them as stocking stuffers. I liked mine so much.,2020,10
Beautiful vibrant colors! Great quality mouse Comfortable to use.,2020,10
The lights change colors; distracting or cool?  You decide.  Wireless and rechargable via usb.  Overall:  servicable.,2020,10
Best Purchase ever! I’ve never heard of a rechargeable mouse. I love the light color changing feature which is a bonus. THIS IS A MUST BUY!!!,2020,10
Very quite no clicking noise and it stays lit up all day.,2020,10
"It looks nice but after using it for a few weeks, it hasn't worked for my online work. Sometimes it is not so responsive, which affects my job performance. I don't know if I came across a faulty model. The USB-C adapter was not included.I will try the new one and update my review.",2020,10
Works just fine.,2020,10
I love the color changing feature while using,2020,10
Not sure for games but its really comfortable and pretty cool with the colors,2020,10
"I may have gotten a defective product, but the left and right click buttons rub together when clicking, so you need to press harder than you normally would to select and without the click noise, it’s hard to tell if you actually did select something. I ordered a different one from another company and will be returning this one.",2020,10
Works well with MacBook for gameplay love the changing light and ergonomic,2020,10
I love this little mouse! It’s beautiful and comfortable and matches my new Mac Air and mouse pad perfectly!!,2020,10
Works really well,2020,10
👍,2020,10
I love the feel of this mouth. I love that it automatically goes to sleep and it has an on off button. Best portable mouse.,2020,10
This mouse is cheap as heck. I opened it up and it feels and looks like something good buy from Dollar Tree.,2020,10
This was delivered less than 6 weeks ago. It's barely been used and is already broken. I cannot right click at all.  I would not recommend this product at all.,2022,11
"you get what you paid for lol it worked great at first, but the usb receiver stopped working after 4 months so the mouse couldn’t connect to mac AT ALL. tragic",2022,11
Piece of junk. Already broken. Irritated,2022,09
"I am pleasantly surprised by this mouse!  I don't use them in general often, but ended up buying one because my laptop doesn't love to let me use the keypad and wasd while gaming without delaying one or the other slightly.  I wasn't necessarily expecting transitioning to using a mouse to be easy, but it really has been!  It has no lag while I'm gaming at all, is very smooth gliding, doesn't hurt my wrists at all, and holds a charge for a long time.  I have forgotten to turn it off several times, and gone back to use it a few days later and it was still plenty charged enough for a couple of hours of gameplay.  Highly recommended.",2020,10
"The connection as a wireless mouse works well. However, clicking is a challenge; I am not sure how to explain it. It is not ergometric, and it doesn't click. I am not sure why people would enjoy this mouse. I don't recommend it.",2020,10
"This product is very good. Super light, and sleek.",2020,10
Stopped working after a week.,2020,10
I do have to charge it about once every couple weeks or less. That’s better than needing batteries I suppose,2022,11
I’ve never used this as a game if mouse but I did use it for my kindle fire hd and it was perfect I used it just like I would for a labtop and it worked out so well,2022,11
Buy for work. Fit my hand. Good for my aim,2022,11
The mouse is already broken after a little over a month. Waste of money. The wheel no longer works...smh,2022,11
"I am a college student so naturally, I need a mouse that lights up. The picture made the mouse look so cool with the lights. But the white mouse I ordered was more of a transparent white so the lights made the mouse look like something I bought at a swap meet. Super cheap! Now for the function-- It worked great for a few months then the sensor on the bottom started to get an attitude with me. I wanted to go to the right of my screen and it would want to go left. I attempted to perform an exorcism on it just in case there was a demon possessing it. Either I did it wrong or the demon was too powerful for my faith or the mouse is malfunctioning. I'll let you decide the storyline on that one. Prior to it becoming possessed it worked great and charged up fast. The charger is old school not USB-C.",2022,11
Easy to use very light weight.,2022,11
"Charged according to directions,,, so far ,,,,, using 10 plus hours  four days no problems  thanks",2022,11
I like that the mouse is smooth. It feels nice and light under my hand. It is also a smooth processing mouse. it follows where you direct it with no lagging. I get a lot of compliments on this mouse and it was easy to set it up.,2022,11
"I purchased this mouse and received it on September 28th. I charged it and started to use it, it worked fine up until today 11/8. Now the left clicker does not work, which is the side used for everything. It has been less than two months and I am unable to use the mouse for work. Waste of money",2022,11
It's quiet. You don't hear the constant clicking and I love the different color led lights,2022,11
Great on the hand and adaptability to Surface device,2022,11
Rechargeable,2022,11
Doesn't work on the white surface (white desk),2022,11
"The scroll button stopped working after 4 months.  I bought it in July and now only November, it doesn't work anymore. It's very unfortunate this happened.  I would expect this will last.  The shape is good, It's easy to use and to connect.  But the item I received unfortunately didn't last.  I will try to contact the seller and see what they say.",2022,11
I actually have a pixel slate and it works great with it.,2022,11
One day delivery was great. Well packaged and installed in no time.,2022,11
"The transmitter isn't that strong, the mouse starts to jump and delays so much if it's too far from it. I ended up going back to my original one until I find a new one again.",2022,11
Love Love Love!,2022,11
Stopped working after 1 month.. The usb-c adapter also broke,2022,11
I love that it's rechargeable and you don't need batteries.,2022,11
I love this mouse and it works great.,2022,11
I am so happy with it. It fits well in my hand. It goes in to sleep mode so it saves power and that is amazing cus I fall asleep a lot when I am on my laptop. I am a college student and it is amazing for it its small and really smooth. The light feature is amazing when it is off that when u use it it still has a rad light emit when u r using it and I love it sooo much I am definitely in love with the product.,2022,11
i love it its quiet and rainbows and sleek.,2022,11
Lasted exactly 3 months then stopped working properly.  I really loved the feel and accuracy when it worked but would expect better quality. wouldn't scroll and became jerky.,2022,11
"The receiver is located at the bottom of the mouse, which is theory is a great idea. However, it’s stuck way too deep and I can’t get it out without breaking something. Very sad!",2022,11
Good mouse for the price!,2022,11
"I love how you can plug it into a USB charger or into the USB on the device to charge. I say durable because I have dropped mine, stepped on it, you make it and it still works as good as day one!",2022,11
This mouse is more comfortable than my older model.  It's accurate and quick when I use it.  The sleep mode works great and it holds a charge longer than I expected it would.  So far it works as it should and the colors are a cute feature.,2022,11
"I liked this mouse until it broke. Two days outside of the return window. The roller for the scroll function broke, while I was scrolling. I was nothing but gentle with this mouse and it only lasted 32 days.It is nice looking, the colored lights are not obnoxious, and it is very quiet.",2022,11
"Seems to hold a charge for a long time - so far I've charged every couple of days.I work from home, so my mouse gets a lot of use.  I got tired of replacing batteries in my other ones.",2022,11
This thing is awesome everyone at work has asked me were i got it,2022,11
"First the roller broke, then the left button.  The LED lights are pretty cool though.",2022,11
"Careful with this one.  I bought it last month, the return window closed Oct 12 and it broke today.  Any chance of a good will exchange folks?",2022,11
"Bought this mouse as the color and LED’s were quite cool. Would expect it to work like a normal mouse but when clicking, one has to click quite hard for it to work. Moreover, there is a lag when moving the cursor while using the mouse. Thought it was a battery issue but even after charging it, the same thing happened.",2022,11
It works,2022,11
My son loves this he had another mouse and he lost the piece and this is a good replacement I love the slick design,2022,11
I like the the ease of use. I don't go through batteries because it's chargeable. The light is not over bearing. The lights don't disturb sleeping loved ones. The ergonomic design is easy on the hands. Overall it's a nice and easy product to use.,2022,10
"It's nice. It lights up. Has a good feel while in your hand. Stayed charged for a good bit after the 1st charge. However after it died the first time, it doesn't hold charge for very long now. Its not bad for someone who doesn't use it daily. I'm constantly using my computer so it dying after 1 days use is a pain and I don't have time to let it charge for forever. I went back to using a battery mouse.",2022,10
"My first mouse I ordered in July 2022 started acting wild - not able to control where the cursor went. I contacted the company, and they did send me a new one to replace and did not ask for me to return the first one. Which was great; however, the roller on the second mouse has now stopped working. It is a great looking and comfortable mouse - wished it had worked. Afraid to try a third.",2022,10
The mouse itself is beautiful. The lights make it 10x better. I’m rating this a 2 because it worked good for the first few days but after that I noticed that it randomly stops working even after it’s fully charged. I have to move the switch to off and back on for it to work. Sometimes it still lags or cuts off and I literally have to keep it on charge for it to work continuously. I don’t think it’s going into sleep mode because it does it sometimes while I’m actively using the mouse.,2022,10
Using with my new laptop.,2022,10
Love the lights and it's comfortable to use.,2022,10
I really wanted a rechargeable mouse as I use a lot of batteries in my regular wireless mouse.  I work in a fast paced computer orientated office. I type fast and navigate faster. The mouse couldn’t keep up.  Often found myself turning it off and back on because it just wouldn’t move. Returned it for a refund.,2022,10
Doesn't work after less than 30 days of having it,2022,10
Love this mouse. Just what I was looking for,2022,10
I use this for my laptop I needed a silent wireless mouse. It’s wireless and silent. The roll ball button is loud like a regular mouse but left and right are quiet. I charged it used it once the next day I tried to charge it and cut it on it wouldn’t come on. Or the red light flashed and immediately went off. I wouldn’t buy this.,2022,10
Love the different colors,2022,10
"Not big on the sleep mode, but it does come back quick enough. Good enough for the price",2022,10
Great colors. It's a little difficult for me to click quickly. Wish it held a charge longer.,2022,10
"This is the second time I bought this mouse, very cheaply made, and the scroll wheels broke both times after about 2,3 months of use, do not recommend this item.",2022,10
Works well and is a nice fit for the hand. If you use a mouse for a long time. You want a comfortable fit.,2022,10
Love this thing...no batteries.. just recharge and go,2022,10
"Only lasted about a year, but worked great for that year, so I just pretend they're like the old Bic lighters, disposable.  This is my second one, we'll see if it lasts a year, longer or less.",2022,10
The mouse scroller broke within a month,2022,10
I wish I would have gotten one earlier. I love it and it makes working in my laptop so much easier,2022,10
I had no issues with the mouse but I dropped it from not even 2ft from the ground (on accident of course) and the spin wheel and the left clicker broke. I’ve ordered another one and I hope it lasts longer than this one did.,2022,10
Bought 7 months ago now I have to charge it every other day.,2022,10
Does what its meant for,2022,08
"I've learned this lesson (again). Open the package and use the product right away. I ordered this mouse in August as my 'travel' mouse and just packed it away in my bag. Now, I've been visiting family in the PNW since mid-September. The mouse took a charge and worked fine for a couple of weeks. After I recharged the mouse, it worked for a day or two and then ceased to function. The optical light will flash once when turned on then.... nothing. Of course, the return window is well past.",2022,10
It is so slow and lags find a better option,2022,10
Roller ball stopped working within 4 months of minimal use.  Piece of junk.,2022,10
I like the color and size but it’s a few days out of the return period and it will not hold a charge,2022,10
"Overall I love this mouse. The size, weight, clicking is all fabulous. However I’ve had two of these now and the middle scroller has randomly fallen in without rough use, it wasn’t dropped, literally was not even touching it the second time and I heard it fall. If you need to use the middle scroller a lot I do not recommend purchase. If you don’t use that feature then it’s a great mouse.",2022,10
It stopped working,2022,10
"My son uses a school issued Chromebook for school work and hates using the touch pad to navigate the mouse. So we looked into a wireless mouse and found this one had so many good reviews. Unfortunately, the scrolling wheel has already broken and he has only used it a month. Since he only uses it for his school computer it mostly stayed stored safely in the carrying case. He was not rough with it and it was stored carefully when not in use. I am really disappointed because he loved the color and paid for this with his own money earned helping his grandmother over the summer at a campground. There is an email on the bottom of the mouse that says lifetime replacement but I have tried twice now to email them about it and it keeps bouncing back as undeliverable. I am sure this has been a great product for many and we likely got the dud so I am not telling anyone not to buy it but I am sharing our experience for others to consider.",2022,10
Loved this cute little mouse but it broke after 2 months. The wheel broke off from the gear.,2022,10
Should've spent the money to get a quality product. This thing stopped working after about a week. Worthless,2022,10
"Beautifully produced and lovely to look at for a mouse.  The lights are a welcome addition to an otherwise drab workspace.  I did notice that it tends to go into a sleep mode quickly, but takes a longer ‘wake up’ time than I expect.  On a screen busy with windows, the cursor freezes in position until the mouse fully comes back to life.  It’s frustrating for anyone who isn’t patient.",2022,10
"Loved this at first. However, battery is pretty much shot. I am only using it with a home entertainment system (computer), so it isn't getting used a lot. However, in less than 3 months, I new need to charge it daily or at least every other day.I'm not sure the sleep function is working. I may try turning it off after every use to charge it less often, but that will become annoying super fast, even if it does work. It will likely end up in the trash before long.",2022,10
First one broke in 1 week they sent a replacement and I returned broken one and it still hasn’t processed return now new one broke 2 weeks later.  I would not recommend this mouse,2022,10
I don't typically write reviews but I keep having this issue with tech products from amazon. The mouse stopped working after 2 months of use. It charges and sometimes I can get short term use out of it but it's very glitchy and lags across the screen.,2022,10
I liked the wireless mouse however after 3 months the roller on the mouse stopped working which leaves me not being able to scroll up or down on my pc. I’ll have to look into buying a more sturdy mouse.,2022,10
The wheel from the mouse not working anymore. It only lasted for about 2 months. Really nice mouse but doesn't last.,2022,10
"Nothing but issues the scroll wheel broke for no reason at all, no longer holds a charge. Would not recommend!!!",2022,10
Wouldn’t recommend have been trying to charge it for days!,2022,10
"I bought this in late June, it looks cool with the lights and all. It doesn't give a warning that the battery is low, just stops working. Now it is doing all kinds of weird stuff, clicking on items that you didn't, etc. Too late to return...oh well...not recommended.",2022,10
After a few weeks the scroll wheel stopped working. I'm returning it.,2022,10
This is the second time I have ordered this mouse. I actually really like the mouse except for the fact that they keep breaking and I have to order a new one. So for that reason I am only going to give you two stars. I ordered this particular mouse only two months ago and it’s already broken.  I should get my money back.,2022,10
Excellent for price!,2022,10
Disappointed in this mouse. The wheel broke after 7 months.,2022,10
It felt like it would break easily and the texture of the mouse would get dirty quickly.,2022,10
"Bought this mouse on December 2021. Its October 2022 and no matter how long I charge it, the only thing it does is blink the red light once and die. Don't recommend this at all.",2022,10
"It works ok.  Nothing spectacular.  If you're a gamer or use the mouse quite a bit, you have to charge it about once a day, or it starts lagging and causes things to crash or freeze up due to the lag.",2022,10
Unfortunately this mouse stopped working after a month of use. Can I replace the item or get a refund?,2022,10
I bought this mouse to go with my work laptop when I have to travel to sites. I HATE using the pad that is built into the laptop. This is cute and little. I am thinking about using it for my personal laptop when gaming or doing school work.,2022,10
Got two of these with colors that matched out tablets. Easy to transport and just right feel in my hand. So far they work perfectly and at what I would consider a great price.,2022,10
The mouse wheel broke and just spins now.  I used this for my work laptop and loved it but if this is the quality it is I will not buy another,2022,10
"I liked this product, until is stopped working 4 months later.",2022,10
"I’ve actually purchased two of these and both broke in the same way, the scroller. I do not recommend if you need them for any kind of gaming that requires the scroller. I need to use it for camera angles in game and without it gameplay is awful. I won’t be buying a third one, BUT if that’s not gonna be a problem for you then these will probably be great. They hold a charge well and the light show they put on is really cool.",2022,10
Easy to use,2022,10
" It's an excellent product. If you're looking for a wireless mouse, a good price and with high load durability, that's correct. I use it for work in ArcGis. Excellent service",2022,10
"As a lot of other reviewers said, the scroll wheel broke. I have had a different USB mouse for years without this problem. I'll be going back to it.The battery life is also very short. I'm constantly having to recharge it.",2022,10
FIrst time that I need to change the battery and it doesnt work anymore!!!  NO duro NI 6 Meses!!!,2022,10
Quit working after 6 months. Can't get it to work anymore charging port is messed up I have unplugged it once.,2022,10
Repeatedly and without proper functioning my mouse turned on for 1 second then turned right back off again after being plugged into the laptop overnight.  I searched for power issue reviews and found I am not the only one.  I cannot recommend this product and feel it should be taken down due to this.,2022,10
Stopped working 1 month after I received this,2022,10
"Didn’t, work, would not charge",2022,10
This is exactly what I needed. My favorite features are the quite clicks and the led lights.,2022,10
I got this less and two months ago and I LOVED it.... until today when it broke when I touched the wheel.,2022,10
"It was cute and worked super well while it lasted but about 6 weeks into using it, it just stops. Doesn’t hold a charge, doesn’t stay on. Of course it lasts beyond when you can return it so just don’t take the chance.",2022,10
It already doesn't work,2022,10
"I have had this a few months and loved it, but now the roller to scroll is not working.",2022,10
Haven’t had it long. USB-C adapter is already broken so my mouse is currently unusable on my MacBook. Mouse is decent but seems to not hold a charge very long when I was using it.,2022,10
I purchased this mouse back in June of this year. It is now October. The battery life is soo powerful. The color changing is the best experience I could have ha with a mouse. I can't believe how happy I am with this purchase.,2022,10
"The center scroll wheel broke in 3 weeks for no reason. Mouse was not dropped and barely used. Garbage, so you get what you pay for.",2022,10
"Charged all night, and only last few minutes.This mouse has pretty design, but it's too thin to hold.Just asked for refund but not replaced.",2022,10
This worked for a few months. I had to charge it overnight 2x a week as I work from home and used this mouse for my work laptop. After several months it stopped holding a charge and would have to be charged daily. Now it won’t charge or work. Super annoying because I really need a mouse and now I have to order another one. I had hoped this would last a LOT longer than 5 months but now I’m putting plastic into the landfill and it sucks.,2022,10
"You could think it's a decent mouse for the price you paid. But, in reality, it is an uncomfortable mouse and barely works. The only good thing about this mouse is that it comes with a USB to USB-c adapter, which comes in handy.",2022,10
"A very reasonably priced cordless, rechargeable mouse with 3-button control with scroll wheel, which is my preference rather than the MacBookAir track pad or the Mac Mouse for the desktop Mac.",2022,10
"I would buy it against n. It’s pretty, not really bling, just sleek.",2022,10
Its a nice mouse but i'm not sure if its good for gaming.,2022,10
cool and easy to use at first. but broke with in a few weeks of use.,2022,10
This product simply doesn’t work. The charger connection port is mishapen.,2022,10
"I hated this item, they described how easy it was to use and I received mine and it does not connect. after doing my research on it , its suppose to be compatible with my laptop and its not, so now I have to order a different one, im very disappointed in this product.",2022,10
"Feels very cheap. Wouldn’t charge on my laptop, had to plug it in on my desktop to charge it. Finally got it charged just for it to die after 2 hours of non-continuous use. It’s getting returned.",2022,10
" Bought this mouse for my office to go with the theme and love it, was kind of frustrated at first because it was tricky getting it to come on but after holding the two buttons it worked. Great purchase.",2022,10
My first one I had about 2 weeks and the wheel broke loose and it would not work. I received a replacement in two days and it's perfect! Can't blame them for a manufacturing issue. I love my pink mouse. I highly recommend it. I use it 8 hours a day 5 days a week.,2022,10
It works well.  It does what I purchased it for.,2022,10
Scroll interior post broke causing the mouse to no longer work. Bought in Jan 2022 broke Oct 2022. Otherwise nice functioning overall,2022,10
"I purchased this mouse as the wheel on my old one quit working, I loved the design and wanted another so I ordered it and received it Aug 31, 2022 It is Oct 17, 2022, and the wheel just quick working again.  I would recommend looking at a different mouse if you prefer your scrolling feature.",2022,10
This item is poorly made. Battery died within 40 minutes after full charge (3 hours) It was returned the same day it was delivered.,2022,10
"Mouse worked fine for 3 months, charged it every week or so. Then wouldn't charge via USB. Not good option for those who need something reliable.",2022,10
"Received product on the 12th, charged it and started using it. The charge didn't last that long maybe a day at most. But today (10/17/22) it doesn't work at all. Glad I kept my old battery one.",2022,10
"This mouse was great, up until today when the scroll finger pad completely broke? The scroll function is loose and now wont work at all :(",2022,10
I've had this for a month and a half it's stopped working.  I've tried charging repeatedly and it does nothing.,2022,10
This worked great for 5 months then one day just stopped working...,2022,10
Worked well for the first few weeks then Broke right after return window closed.,2022,10
"It was ok for a cheap mouse, it started lagging after a few months, and eventually quit working over all",2022,10
Broke in less than 2 months. Scrolling won't workWouldn't recommendQuit right outside the return window,2022,10
Ergonomic and fits my hand well.Pretty when charged.***mine doesn’t hold a charge well. It only lasts a couple hours at most.,2022,10
Certainly helps to look at instructional pictures and to try to translate what the instructions mean,2022,10
The little wheel broke within the 2nd day,2022,10
Performs as expected,2022,10
"Mouse seems to work ok. Looks nice, easy install, etc, Biggest complaint is the time out and wake up feature. Every time I go to use the PC, it's asleep. Then have to either click a button (which may/may not cause an action on the PC) or pick it up and down several times. Too annoying so stopped using it. Might keep it aside for use with my laptop when traveling, Definitely not for daily use.",2022,10
"Not bad, would rather have purchased apple",2022,10
"This is slim, quiet and I absolutely love the changing of colors. Best mouse I've had !!",2022,10
This worked great at first but have to keep it on power or it will only last about 2 hours after about 5 months.,2022,10
I bought this mouse to match the keyboard I bought for my daughter to use with her laptop. She does online school and likes having a mouse as well as a keyboard. She likes that they match and both light up. I didn't know how it would be for gaming.,2022,10
Very easy to use and sleek design. It is small enough to fit easily into my computer bag when I have to take it with me.,2022,10
Good feel and ergonomics but scroll wheel broke at six weeks. Design/plastic quality selection does not live up to common everyday use.,2022,10
"This is nice little mouse, very quiet clicking, and I get lots of compliments on the changing color lights.",2022,10
Did not work with intended laptop,2022,10
"Sleek, ergonomic feel, quiet clicker. Easy to charge, USB easy to install. Would definitely recommend for the price!",2022,10
I just purchased this mouse to use with my new laptop and am impressed with the quietness of the buttons and it has helped me win on my games,2022,10
"Love the clickity clicks of the mouse, got it for my daughter for online school work and she loves the damn thing.",2022,10
"This mouse would not connect to my compute despite multiple attempts following the instructions given. As is typical of many Amazon products, this product is cheaply made and not worth wasting your money on.I would suggest avoiding making purchases from this brand in the future, and strongly suggest NOT BUYING THIS MOUSE. Unless throwing money away on broken pieces of junk that don't work is a past time of yours. Then knock yourself out.",2022,10
Bought the item and scroll button and left button stopped working after about 3 months of use,2022,10
"Item worked fine for 5 months and then no longer would turn on. And yes, it was fully charged. Of course it was past the return date, so its basically junk... Save your money and buy a name brand",2022,10
"The mouse is very slim but is so cheaply made don't dare drop it or it's going to break, I won't by another one",2022,10
"It doesn’t work anymore! After a month when the return is no longer allowed, then it stopped working.",2022,09
"These things stop working after a few weeks! I got two and one it just refuses to charge or stay on. The other, the scroller fell! Very poorly made! DO NOT PURCHASE!",2022,10
"I like how slim it is, and the colors are a nice touch without being distracting. Clicking is responsive, though the movement was a little glitchy (for me) sometimes. My biggest complaint is that the USB sticks out super far if you have to use the USB-C adapter.",2022,10
"Love the color, love how it changes colors and love how it holds a charge!",2022,10
"I bought this mouse because it said it was rechargeable and I wouldn’t have to remember to always have batteries around. I used it for a few days and once the better inside died, I went to recharge it. I charged it for 5+ hours (even though it says the charge time is 2-3 hours) and then went to go use it and it does not work",2022,10
"Put one star because this store sent me a bad mouse twice. the first was working, then not working. the next did not work at all. Just wasted time and money.",2022,10
I love the sleep mode. So easy to use.,2022,10
Works on MacBook Pro.,2022,10
"I loved this little mouse. It looked great. It felt great in my hand. The wheel was nice for scrolling. The battery even held a charge for what I thought was a reasonable amount of time. I would categorize my usage as light-moderate use (and no abuse).Then came the day, about a month after arrival, right after the return window closed, that it started glitching. Now, it drops off, not responding, then will work again, then drop off again and I’m not talking about sleep mode- this is during active use. Back and forth. Back and forth. It’s frustrating, probably more because I so desperately want a mouse instead of my laptop’s trackpad.All that said, I didn’t spend a whole lot of money on this mouse, so I get what I pay for. I just wish I had gotten a little more than a month before the glitching.",2022,10
The scroll button broke after just a month. Would not recommend,2022,10
"I was happy with this purchase until the mouse wheel quit working. I purchased this device on July 24, 2022 and a week ago (September 2022) it quit working. After looking through the questions, I see others have experienced this too. I wouldn't purchase this item. It's a known issue.",2022,10
"I got this for my mother because she wanted something pink and cheap. It really feels like its made of trash. It does seem to work well enough, though the tracking is inconsistent at best. The ergonomics are really non existent, doesn't seem like it's made for human hands.Overall, if you're buying for somebody who wants something cheap and pink and cant tell the difference go for it, but if you actually care about having a half decent mouse skip this one.",2022,10
Like it’s size. Perfect fit for laptop bag,2022,10
"Nice mouse, a little too lightweight for my liking. Battery lasts a while.Track wheel already broke, unfortunately.",2022,10
"The on/off switch often feels like there is sand in the mouse when moving it, it’s not a smooth move like I would have expected. I like the mouse but that roughness is annoying at times.",2022,10
It’s taken me a while to remember to turn it on after it sits awhile.,2022,10
you get what  you pay for,2022,10
I bought one and the piece going into my laptop didn’t work. The second broke easily.,2022,10
very good product.,2022,10
I love this mouse it’s quiet and pretty and the battery lasts a while I probably charge it once maybe twice a week,2022,10
"It’s ergonomic and stylish. Very cute colors and cool lights. Comes with all the attachments like cords for charging and it has a small indent under the mouse to keep the part that plugs into your laptop. I’m forever losing mine so that’s a great feature. Very quiet as well. I recommend it for a nice, cheap little mouse.",2022,10
Amazing feels cheap but is very durable,2022,10
"Very nice mouse , love the size and feel",2022,10
Very cheap mouse. Connectivity is poor at times.,2022,10
love the colors so far ok,2022,10
"i love the different colors, easy to find at night.  holds a charge for a few days.",2022,10
"Soft, light, smooth.",2022,10
I like how light and easy to handle is!,2022,10
Love it,2022,10
"I only had this item for a month if that, and it has already stopped working. It will not hold a charge and it is not the cable. I shouldn’t have ignored the other comments about it not working. Don’t make my same mistake!",2022,10
"I really liked this mouse when I first got it. It was low profile, had a nice soft and quiet click, had rainbow lights, and was available in a rose gold color. I thought I'd made a great purchase. Now, I've had it for less than 2 months and the scroll wheel is so squeaky. I can't stand to hear it when I'm scrolling through documents. Bummed it was a lemon!",2022,10
i use the mouse instead of mousepad,2022,10
very nice,2022,10
Prompt delivery on an awesome product,2022,10
"The colors were great while it worked. The wheel broke, and the usb fell apart when pulling it out of the computer.",2022,10
Bought one at first broke within a couple of months thinking maybe it was my daughter Bought another and broke again within a couple of months  the middle wheel on the mouse is defective and it the same problem from the first one I bought,2022,10
"Lightweight mouse, easy to charge, CAN USE WHILE CHARGING, and I like the teal color I got with fun colors lighting up. Makes my office work and time at the computer feel a little less boring. Easy to connect and works well with iMac.",2022,10
"so sad - been using for ~2 months only, and the scroll wheel broke already. bye bye scrolling feature. kind of a turn off to use it now that its broken",2022,10
"You have to press down very hard on the mouse, it gets very annoying. I wish I still had the box I’d return it",2022,10
Perfect little mouse! This mouse is so easy to use and to charge up it’s lightweight I love the little colors and it fits my hand perfectly,2022,10
"This product only lasted 4 days, I thought it was not charged but it not that",2022,10
"I don’t use this mouse often, and the mouse has completely failed. Won’t turn on, it does light up when it is charging but won’t turn on and stay on. Completely unusable. Pretty big bummer since I’m past return.. I do not recommend.",2022,10
Perfect in my office love the lightweight and easy to use.,2022,10
The mouse has good shape and charges quickly but the roll just broke after one week of use,2022,10
Sleep mode works well,2022,10
"Simple to use.  Long battery life.  recharges by plugging into your computer.  This is the first mouse i've enjoyed using that wasn't wired.  This works much better than the old battery opperated ones, and has a much longer battery life.",2022,10
It's a no for me.,2022,10
Lasted a little over  a month and the scroll wheel stopped working.,2022,10
It doesn't stay charged for very long,2022,10
"Just plugged it in and it worked perfectly.  I wanted a small, low profile mouse to use when I travel, so far this one seems great.  The Chromebook I travel with only has usb-C ports, and I did think that that this mouse came with a usb-c receiver, but it doesn't.  It comes with usb receiver and an adapter which works fine but together they are over an inch long which is a little awkward.  It means I have to be very careful not to bump it and beak it.  If the receiver were smaller this would be ideal.  Overall, great value.",2022,10
Quiet and just what I was looking for,2022,10
"It was great to begin with. For the price I wasn’t expecting a lot. However, the scroll wheel quit working within the first 5 times of using it which is one of the reasons I purchased it to begin with 🥲",2022,10
The mic stopped working and charging after a few weeks,2022,10
"It looks awesome and is really quiet. only had it for a short time, but I love it.",2022,10
Terrible product!! First mouse broke within a week. Second mouse broke within 6 months!,2022,09
This is broken within a month.,2022,09
Mine stopped working… it doesn’t work on a mouse pad. And freezes when I use it on top of a flat surface.,2022,09
"Cheap, broke after 2 months",2022,09
The product is cheap and worked well for the first 2 months,2022,09
Stopped working in less than a week.  Just up and died...and now it has to be returned and look for another one.  Save yourself the effort and keep on lookin'...this ain't it!,2022,09
"Battery takes forever to die which is great, sleep mode helps a lot. It’s thinner and smoother than any other mouse I’ve own. Love the lights!!!!",2022,09
Purchased two. Works as described.You can't beat this price.Highly recommend!,2022,09
"I got it for my husband, he chose his colors lol It worked with daily use for about a month until it died. That's when we figured we have to charge it, which was fine. But we cannot figure out how to tell when the battery is low and it needs charging.",2022,09
I like that it does not need batteries. The battery lasts a long time.,2022,09
"I read the other reviews and it seems great.I fully charge mine and it last a few hours.If the charge lasted, this would be a good mouse.I have to rate mine a 'one'.",2022,09
"Right out of the box, the mouse never worked. The buttons activate, but the mouse never moved the cursor.  Junk.",2022,09
Very good,2022,09
"I bought one for my laptop and 2 days after I got it, the wheel stopped working and I could hear something loose inside it. I returned it for a replacement. The new one seems to be working fine, although sometimes the cursor glides smoothly across the screen and other times it jumps around a lot. Maybe this is just something wireless mice do? I don't know; I've never had one before.",2022,09
Tried 3 times using this in the week I've had it.  I even checked to make sure it was fully charged.Turned it off/on several times and no improvement. Movement of cursor is very slow/delayed.  Very disappointed with functionality.  I went back to using my battery operated mouse.,2022,09
"Sleek and nice, love the colors! Great buy!",2022,09
"Initially I thought it’s a great piece but slowly I am struggling to use it as it stops working or goes to sleep for long. I does not get activated by just simply moving a bit, has to moved few times or even hit it on pad at time.",2022,09
"I bought this for my work laptop and I really like it.  The coloring changing option is fun, but I don’t turn that on very often so the charge lasts longer.  I have small hands and it fits my hand comfortably.",2022,09
"I got this in June and it’s now the end of September. It was great at first and lasted multiple days on a charge, but now the battery dies after just a couple of hours. And it dies randomly without any warning so it’s always in the middle of using it. Frustrating, this lasted maybe 3 months in totalUpdate again a month later, this is dead and battery lasts a few minutes at most even after charging up fully",2022,09
The c-type converter from this item wasn’t working so I had to use the one I had. Everything else was working good other than that.,2022,09
Love this mouse it has a sleek design and works wonderful! Love the quietness and the perfect fit for my small hands.,2022,09
Nice mouse and l like that the mouse sleeps to save the battery.,2022,09
"looks like the track wheel is connected to an internal device using a very fragile thin piece of plastic.  I was simply using the mouse (I didn't drop it or slam it) and suddenly the tactile feedback of using the track wheel stopped and the mouse would no longer scroll the screen.  too bad, I actually liked the mouse until then.",2022,09
Mouse is nice and lightweight and quiet. But its lags and jumps around sometimes,2022,09
Stopped working a few weeks after purchase.,2022,09
"I admit I was going to return this item because I did not understand the little USB attachment was on the bottom of the device.  I had charged it, but was using the little black USB insert in my laptop which did not work.  Once I inserted the white short USB from underneath the pointer, my computer accepted it and it works great!  I am still learning how to use these devices at age 74.  It is gorgeous and works!",2022,09
Mouse works well and is a good value for the inexpensive price.,2022,09
Love the mouse and it's quick connectivity to the computer. Not happy the scroll bottom quit working.,2022,09
glitchy and charge doesn't last,2022,09
"Nice size, color is true to expectation. Easy use and setup. Has usbc adapter included for newer hardware. USB adapter fits in base of mouse. Works well on multiple surfaces. Quick charging.",2022,09
Works great,2022,09
It stopped working within 2 days of use.,2022,09
It felt like a cheap product upon arrival and usage. After 2 months and no longer charges and is absolutely useless.,2022,09
As expected. Would buy again,2022,09
"I’ve had this mouse for almost 10 months. It worked so well and the color changing lights add a little pizazz. Unfortunately, the scroll wheel stopped working. It no longer has tension on it. It just spins now and moves nothing on the screen :(",2022,09
Turns itself off and battery doesn't last a whole work day.,2022,09
I work from home and this mouse is very comfortable and responsive.,2022,09
It did not come with a USB cable to charge the mouse. I wasted my money.,2022,09
This mouse is much faster than my last few. I like the charging system. Drawback is when the charger comes missing( and it will happen in my house) how to replace it?,2022,09
Unfortunately the scroll function is already broken. Otherwise this is a very cute and comfy mouse. I love the lights.,2022,09
I got this mouse and i charged it like it said to but when i went to use it it doesn't even work. I would not recomend anyone to get this mouse.,2022,09
Beautiful!,2022,09
"Didn't hold a charge long, but now won't recharge at all, just threw it in the trash.Had a battery operated mouse for 5 years until I lost it. Going back to batteries.",2022,09
"I purchased this mouse thinking it had a USB-C connector, not a USB with a USB-C adaptor (my bad). I opted to keep it. Three stars on its scrolling as it was not smooth, but it worked.  I would have kept it, but after a couple of weeks, it died and would not charge despite being plugged in for hours.  Don't waste your money; go with a tried and true brand",2022,09
I used it for about six weeks and it stopped working,2022,09
"Honestly waste of money. Didn’t charge, after 2 hours, and just didn’t work.",2022,09
it is easy to use,2022,09
"This works like a normal mouse and everything! However, the light that's in the mouse is so bright, it shines through the white on my mouse. It's not good aesthetically, however, if you want a mouse that does mouse things, this one's fine.",2022,09
Dropped this mouse once from desk to carpet and the scroll button broke. I guess you get what you pay for...,2022,09
It broke after being used for one week,2022,02
"Love this mouse overall- beautiful lights, fits well in hand, responsive - but wheel broke after less than one month of regular use for design work. Very sad. This is the second mouse I've bought (first lasted 6 months, same issue) because I like it so much. Unfortunately, will be looking for something different for my next mouse.",2022,09
Just over a month old and the roller no longer functions.  I realize these are cheap…but a month?  Use exclusively for work…not heavy use…,2022,09
Had it for three months and it was working fine. Loved that the click was quiet and it was lightweight. But it stopped charging and working out of nowhere.,2022,09
This is the worst mouse ever!!!!,2022,09
"I wanted a product that I thought I’d have for at least the semester. Since I’ve purchased it, the ball that scrolls down/up is no longer working. Makes a mouse almost pointless to have. Seems am going to need a new mouse.",2022,09
The wheel for scrolling breaks to easily. This is the second one that I’ve purchased with the same issue. I will try another brand.,2022,09
The scrolling wheel is not working properly after 5 months so have to buy a new mouse. The USB charging feature is nice though and it is easy to carry.,2022,09
VERY COMFOT,2022,09
"Love this mouse. Take it anywhere, it's classy yet a little sexy for my workspace. It's very adaptable to who needs it in my house for their devices!",2022,09
Holds a charge for days!!,2022,09
Works perfectly with my Chromebook,2022,09
For me personally just not a good fit,2022,09
Sensitive mouse. Maybe because it’s new. Works fine,2022,09
"This mouse is very useful and beautiful colors, I thought it wouldn’t fit my Mac but it came with a Mac adapter.  Very convenient! And cute too!",2022,09
"This mouse worked great for 2 months, then the scroll wheel broke.  Don’t waste your money.",2022,09
I’ve had this wireless mouse less than a month and the wheel of the mouse has already broke. Not to happy with this mouse. Won’t buy this again,2022,09
This mouse was great at first but after a week the scrolling part stopped working.,2022,09
Scroll wheel stopped working within 60 days. To long after return time. All other features were good.,2022,09
"The scroll wheel broke after using this for like 3 days, very light use too.",2022,09
Just a garbage. Do NOT waste your money: it is NOT working after couple of weeks.,2022,09
Literally won't charge or turn on. Look somewhere else for a mouse.,2022,09
"I bought this mouse on August 3. It worked well for a while, but today (September 21) the mousewheel spins freely while my screen does not scroll. You get what you pay for, and I guess with this you're only paying for a mouse for a month and a half.",2022,09
Ease of use and portability,2022,09
The scroll wheel broke after only 1 month. :-(,2022,09
Works like it should and it’s super easy to set up.,2022,09
Love it,2022,09
"This mouse worked perfectly for about 2 months. Almost on the 2 month mark exactly, the scroll wheel stopped working...it just spins and doesn't move the cursor up and down the page.  I looked to see if I could return, but the window closed a month ago. Don't be tempted by the cheap price. I should have stuck to a name brand!",2022,09
Not for regular or big hands,2022,09
Bought 2 (8/30-7/1) / exchanged 1 immediately due to sent a broken one.Recieved replacement.  Works sometimes.  Won't always work.The other 1.  (Original purchase) scrolly ball won't register any movent 9/18.Good for 2 months if you get one that works properly from the start.,2022,09
It’s a joke. We tried for a long time to get the mouse to even work and it doesn’t. Even after trying the mouse on multiple surfaces and troubleshooting thinking it was our computer. We plugged in a different mouse and it worked fine.Requested a return of the item and I had to pay for the return shipping and print the label. Absolute joke. Don’t waste your time.,2022,09
This wireless mouse works great ! It’s light and connected right to my MacBook Air with no problem.,2022,09
"I ordered my first one in April and had to replace it in June because I dropped it and the mouse wheel stopped working. I got the new one June 17th and today, once again, the mouse wheel stopped working out of nowhere. It barely even lasted three months",2022,09
"My first internal battery mouse.  I liked the ergonomics, but the charging was more frequent than I would have liked.  The mouse was thrown in a landfill, mere months old, because the wheel broke.  R.I.P. mouse..... I'm not really going to miss you.",2022,09
"It’s beautiful, but it literally stopped working after a month…It charges, but when I turn it on it shuts down right away.",2022,09
Barely had it 3 months and the scroll wheel on top stopped working. Now it's pretty much useless.,2022,09
It’s good for a lighting up mouse but isn’t for gaming really,2022,09
The mouse is not effective.  Charged for 24 hours. Still no life or function. Do Not buy. When I noticed that the mouse was not working I charged it for 24 hours. Tried the mouse again and it still did not work but showed red as one of the colors which may be a warning. The seller did not respond or reply to assist me with any troubleshooting. Unsatisfied customer.,2022,09
This product is slim and doesn't fail. Easy click though and lights up. Charge lasts a few day,2022,09
It works just fine just not practical. I always have to recharge the battery. It is a bit of an annoyance.,2022,09
Works good and plug and play.,2022,09
I love this mouse. I've ordered two. The first one lasted me about ~1 year and the second I've received  just died on me about eight months after purchase. The clicker just stopped working on me! :(,2022,09
"I love the color and how slim it is, I use it for work/school.",2022,09
Super light and cute,2022,09
It works well,2022,09
Liked the recharge aspect,2022,09
"I love this mouse, but I have only had for a couple months and it completely stopped working yesterday.",2022,09
Junk,2022,09
"It's a good mouse, worked very well for the time I had it. Driver broke after two months and it doesn't work anymore.",2022,09
Roller ball broke after 2 weeks of use.,2022,09
Great buy…,2022,09
Purchased in June busted in September.  The center wheel broken inside rendering the device worthless.,2022,09
"Terrible product. Only reason I still have it is because Amazon told me just to keep it when I requested a return and refund. Battery doesn’t last at all. Feels terrible in your hand and the buttons and scroll ball are not accurate. Stay away, there are plenty of other cheap rgb mice.",2022,09
Even didn’t lat a month. Broken. Poor “quality”,2022,09
"This mouse worked great, until it didn’t. The scroll wheel no longer works. I use this mouse at my home office, so I haven’t been particularly rough with it where I could understand something breaking after less that 1 year of use.",2022,09
I just love this wireless mouse.  It's not big and bulky.  The clicking is quite and it's really cute looking.,2022,09
It just gets stains easily,2022,09
"I bought this mouse for work and gaming. The first one that arrived broke within the first week of using it. The scroll wheel broke. Returned it and got a replacement. Now, the scroll wheel on the replacement mouse has broken, and the return window has closed. If you're looking for a wireless mouse, do yourself a favor and spend a little extra for quality that won't break after a month or two.",2022,09
"when I first got this item it worked fine, but after a couple of weeks it was not moving the arrow very well.  I dropped it once and it stopped working altogether.",2022,09
Have not had this too long and I’ve charged it and it won’t turn on anymore. I made sure switch is off I even changed chargers it stopped working.,2022,09
"It's a great mouse, perfect and just what I was looking for. It's really quiet which I appreciate because louds clicks do get annoying after some time but not with this mouse. The lights are cool too! Really slim, so it's easy to pack in my work bag, and it feels great while using it.",2022,09
fits well to contour of hand.  withstands multiple drops to the floor.  battery lasts quite a while after charging.  color changing is pretty.,2022,09
works on phone laptop TV all that pretty cool and lights up so wahoo,2022,09
"I really liked using this mouse. It died a hair quicker than I’d like but I would just use it wired while it charged up. However, a month after using it, the middle scroll circle clicked down and wouldn’t come back up, making it impossible for me to use (as I use that often in playing Sims).  I didn’t expect much as I didn’t pay much, but I was slightly disappointed.",2022,09
Bought this in the beginning of August  and it already doesn't work. Don't waste your money.,2022,09
"I like the fact that it turns off after some time, I like that it works with USB-C and I like that I can use it with my Mac or my PC and I like the charging cable.",2022,09
"I use this mouse with my laptop, it worked pretty good when I first got it, then the wheel quit working. I have no idea why .",2022,09
"I saw all the positive reviews and thought this would be a winner. At first, it was great - loved the colors, it is easy to use, but after a few months the scroll wheel stopped working. I dug a little deeper into the reviews and realized this is a common theme. Now I have to buy another mouse already - and it won't be another one of these!",2022,09
It worked less than a month before it stopped charging and became useless. I purchased a second one and will see how long it lasts.,2022,09
"Worked great for about 9 months. Stays charged for a long time, and like being able to use the C port in my laptop. However now the scroll button moves erratic. Scrolling down the page and the page jumps up., go up and it jumps down.",2022,09
"I love this mouse! Easy to set up, easy to use. It seems to go forever on one charge. And the ever changing light color is really cool.",2022,09
The roller on top of the mouse quits working or falls down in the mouse.The colors and lights are fun but the mouse itself is defective. I have had 2 at this point and will not buy another.,2022,09
"I was so excited when I got my mouse in to go with my laptop and it didn’t even work. I had it charge over night while it was off, and still wouldn’t connect.",2022,09
"the mouse was great, it worked very good at first but one day it suddenly stopped charging so I haven’t used it in a while.",2022,09
I absolutely love this mouse!  Great color!  Matches my laptop perfectly!  I love the color changing mode!  So fun!,2022,09
"Sleek look and Battery lasts extremely long, I’ve only had to charge it once since getting it. Highly recommend!",2022,09
" Feels great, wide and comfortable.  Lights up when you move around.  Likes so much I Bought a second one too.",2022,09
"Do not recommend, I bought it two months ago and the roller part already broke and it is now useless",2022,09
"I got this mouse to use with my laptop, and it's great. Glides easily, holds a charge for quite a while, and enters sleep mode when not in use. To wake the mouse up, you just right or left click. The changing lights are a great and fun touch",2022,09
Roller broken only used maybe 10 times,2022,09
This mouse doesn’t work. I ordered a replacement and it still didn’t work. Don’t waste your money.,2022,09
"I have charged it and when I unplug and turn on, it flashes red then nothing.  Tried turning off/on/* and sitll nothing.  Dongle is plugged in to laptop correctly.  If there is no tip to fix will be returing.",2022,09
The mouse is not chargeable. I don't recommend buying it.,2022,09
After 2 months of use and the scroll wheel is broke,2022,09
This mouse did horrible things to my laptop. I no longer have working USB hubs. Also I get a warning message about a malfunction on the computer and that does not go away and if I get it to go away I constantly have a flashing image in the bottom right hand corner of my laptop screen. I took this mouse and my laptop computer to Best Buy and it was determined that the mouse had indeed ruined the USB hubs and I would have had to have sent my computer off for repair and I cannot do that because the laptop is for business. I would never ever recommend this product to anyone for any reason ever.,2022,09
My mouse broke after having it for 2 months. I’m not happy. The middle part where you scroll up and down is not working.,2022,09
Ergonomic and no need for a mouse pad. Smooth scrolling as well. This mouse is compact and has a USB C adapter. The rgb lights are a nice touch too. This is perfect for a small laptop or a tablet. Best of all is the price and quality.,2022,09
Everything,2022,09
Lights are multicolored and are nice. Goes to sleep on its own and is great. Smooth and works fine. Until it breaks. Had it 4 months and 2 days and suddenly while scrolling the wheel broke,2022,09
This is the worst mouse ever it’s hard to glide and it goes dead very fast. Wish I could return it!,2022,09
Worthless to spend 20 min trouble shooting every time i need to use it.,2022,09
"The center scroll wheel lasted less than a week. The mouse itself still works, but it is aggravating that every time you use muscle memory to scroll with a wheel that doesn't work. Decent battery life. Bought a new, different brand mouse to replace it. The mouse also doesn't have much of an arch to it, so its not very ergonomic. Its better than a laptop track-pad though.",2022,09
I love this mouse. I love how quite it is when I use it. Love the sleep feature on it as well. I have nothing bad to say about it. I use it for my online schooling.,2022,09
Stopped working after a month. Will no longer click down unless heavy force. Very bad product,2022,09
Good mouse,2022,09
gets insensitive very quickly and it's so hard to use; light and small and not ergonomic at all; dont recommend buying,2022,09
"Works great, love the quiet clicks, perfect for school without being the annoying one when everything is silent",2022,09
love it,2022,09
"My husband bought 3 of these in different colors for our children for school last month, yesterday was the first day for our 2 youngest. The 1 mouse did great no problem, the second was dead since our daughter likes colors. So we placed it on the charger last night and it's still charging. I unplugged the mouse to see if it had any any charge.....No charge at all. So now I have to explain to my 10 yr old that the company gave her a broken mouse and try to find a way to to get it work with her device while always charging. Should of just went to Target.",2022,09
"The scroller broke within a week, and the material looked greasy and worn after about a week of very limited use.",2022,09
HP laptop compat,2022,09
"I bought this for when I started working from home, after about 2 or 3 months the middle part no longer would scroll the page which is the reason I bought it in the first place. Very disappointing since that’s the reason I bought it in the first place.",2022,09
"I have to charge this mouse way more than I expected especially since I use it for work. Won't buy this again, otherwise seems to work fine besides sometimes jumping from where I have the pointer on the screen to a whole other area. Casual usage this may be fine for you",2022,09
This was the worst mouse I've bought it goes dead very fast and then you have to charge it all night for it to die fast again. I would NOT recommend this mouse.,2022,09
good,2022,09
or should i say WORKED well. it stopped working after like 2 weeks💀,2022,09
Works as described.,2022,09
I used it for about a month and then the sensor broke and the entire thing is useless now,2022,09
"My wrist no longer hurts after being on my computer. Sexy running lights let me see where it is on my desk. I love the pink color, now no one can take it when there batteries are dead and claim your mouse needs batteries. Gotta love family ingenuity.",2022,09
Bought in February and it worked great until 3rd or 4th charge. Now it’s not connecting to my computer any longer.,2022,09
I liked the fact that it uses no battery.  But the charge does not last too long.,2022,09
"Works great.  It’s a little too small and would stress my hand if I used it all day, everyday, but I don’t. So I’m keeping it and am content.  To be more specific, the buttons are not directly below my fingertips (which would be solved by a longer mouse OR an ergonomic one that has a little more height to it.). I’m an averaged sized male, and to my knowledge my hand is typical of that size of person haha.  Hope this helps.",2022,09
"Don't waste your money. It worked well for a few weeks (long enough to miss the return window), but then got jumpy/erratic and wouldn't hold a charge unless plugged in.",2022,09
"It was cheap and the lights are fun but it was cheap and doesn’t work great. Squeaky wheel as you’re scrolling, sometimes it doesn’t track well so that’s annoying. But it gets the job done if your patient. Select a different one.",2022,09
"Product worked well until it didn’t. After 5 months, won’t charge or power on.",2022,09
I guess you get what you paid for. The mouse will not stay charged and will not connect with my iPad. Super disappointed.,2022,09
"I bought this in August and finally managed to get it to work. After just a few minutes of using it, the the roller to scroll stopped working. You can feel when the spring gave way while I was using.  Not sure if it can be fixed",2022,09
"While it's a nice mouse, fits well, it's junk, it died in less than a month, I purchased two so called upgraded updated...don't waste the money...it's junk.",2022,09
Yeah..no. The roller fell inside. I had barely used it,2022,09
I like idea of not needing batteries but needs approvements.,2022,09
"love this mousepad, the clicking is silent and it looks pretty, but the thing dies so FAST!! I work 40 hour week from home and i have to charge the mouse like every day",2022,09
I bought this for my work laptop and just love it. Easy to use and love that it is rechargeable. Fantastic design so it’s not hard on your hands and connects easily with no issues.,2022,08
"When I first received this, I charged it as recommended and it lit up so seemed to work as expected. After charged, I put the toggle in my USB port and nothing happened. It didn’t download anything. It didn’t pair with my laptop. I let it sit then tried again. Nothing. It won’t charge. It won’t light up. Nothing. I never even used it and it stopped working. Very disappointed and a total waste of money.",2022,08
Ergonomic. I would also like to have a full size for desktop use. Multi-color LED adds a nice decorative touch. Mouse wakes up from sleep mode with first click.,2022,08
This is a great mouse. If only my cat would stop breaking them.,2022,08
"This mouse was a back-to school gift for my 8th grade son. It charged fine the first time. Worked ok.  Never charged again and stopped working. School has only been in for one week and he already needs a new mouse ☹️ I can't give it more that one star, if it doesn't work. 🙄",2022,08
"I bought the mouse and used for 1 day, then it kept freezing up. Had to go back to my old mouse",2022,08
"My mouse, no matter how charged it is, loves to just randomly jump to the side of my screen. It's been like this since I first plugged it in... besides that, it's pretty, and I like how the lights combined. It's also really helped me with my carpal tunnel issues.",2022,08
"I ordered this product but the cursor kept jumping around the screen, even when it was fully charged. I figured I just got a bad apple so I made an exchange for a new one. The new mouse came scratched (not a big deal) and the scroll wheel wasn't as smooth (annoying but its fine) but this one's cursor is jumping around the screen too! I would have otherwise liked the mouse. It charges up quickly and I appreciate the sleep mode so that that battery life lasts longer.",2022,08
"Was good while it worked.  Used for basic office work, nothing heavy.  Scroll 'button' broke despite almost never using that function.",2022,08
"I bought this mouse on the 6th of August and it broke on the 31st of the same month. Basically, it lasted me for less than a month. the lights stopped working properly and then the middle part to scroll stopped working, it broke. I do not recommend at all",2022,08
Broke did not work,2022,08
"Used like 10 times before it died. Don't understand the reviews. Horrible product, save your money",2022,08
"This mouse worked for a while but then broke. The led looked fake and crappy. I wouldn’t buy this if I were u. But if u are in a budget, it would do the job. Just be very careful with it.",2022,08
"Product will not charge (tried multiple outlets/boxes/ cords), product turns on for 2 seconds, has a red light,  then shuts off. Junk.",2022,08
"I used this mouse for work as I am a hybrid worker and do most work in the field or different workspaces. When the mouse leaves my home office to go with me, it has its own individual protective/padded case in my work bag.  Worked great until it just stopped working, which is very disappointing after almost 4 months.The mouse still lights up, looks like it works, took a charge from the charger, but will not move on the screen in my work computer (Thinkpad) or personal computer (MacBook). That said, either the mouse internally stopped working in some aspect or the USB dongle is defective per my IT consultant. I tried all possible USB ports, even those on my Apple Magic keyboard and still does not move on the screen. I also tried every idea I could find to reset/repair the issue in line to no avail.It is disappointing and a huge inconvenience this happened. You would expect a product to last more than 4 months. For my coworkers that asked about my mouse as they thought it was cool, they will now be told it died only after a short period of time and cautioned if they decide to buy one.I have yet to hear back from their customer service. And not sure I ever will. Maybe it is true after all, you get what you pay for. Now I need to buy another new mouse, which was something I hoped to not have to worry about for a long time.Please keep in mind, I do not leave this review to bash the company. This review is to let people know my experience with the mouse. Like I said, it worked great until it just stopped working (still lights up, just will not move on my screen) for no apparent reason as it work the night before (8/30/22).Buyer beware.",2022,08
I haven’t used the “sleep mode “ and don’t do gaming,2022,08
Real light weight. Easy to use. Connects quickly,2022,08
I love that the color changes. I haven’t had any problems with it,2022,08
Love the size of it,2022,08
I have bought several of these since this first one.  They work amazing.I have had no issues and I recommend this seller and mouse brand alot.The price is so good!,2022,08
"A few days after the return window expired, the scrolling wheel stopped working.",2022,08
"I like this item a lot. Very fairly priced and the low profile makes it easy on my hand. I don't have the largest hands, but not very small either and a mouse with a high hump is very uncomfortable. This solves that problem nicely. I could do without the sleep mode; I am still getting used to waking it up, and i understand the value of sleep mode so I deal with it. Never having to deal with batteries is also a bonus. Charging it overnight is ideal but I have already forgotten a couple of nights and it's fine. If necessary, you can plug it in and use it while it charges.",2022,08
This product is a piece of junk. It does not work.,2022,08
"Had this mouse for about a month, And the center wheel broke as I was scrolling. Used daily for work.",2022,08
It used to be good until this morning that I couldn’t use the roller since it’s broken. It broke on its own because it’s bad quality,2022,08
White button spin wheel broke 2 months later too late to return!!!,2022,08
It was nice and sleek. It felt very cheaply made though. And it died within 2 weeks of having it. Wouldn't turn on even charged it. Would not recommend buying it.,2022,08
I was concerned that this would be difficult to setup. But I was shocked on how easy it was to connect.,2022,08
"I loved this mouse so much that I bought one for my daughter and my mom. I’ve only had this for less than 2 months and it just stopped working. Tried charging it in multiple outlets, switched the usb around and nothing. It just flashes red when I plug the charger in and goes off. So very disappointed because I’ll now have to buy another and can’t return this one.",2022,08
"This is a cheap product, don't buy it",2022,08
"I bought this mouse to replace one that had the mousewheel break.  To be honest, I loved this mouse  at first - the lights, the feel, everything.  However, I was not a fan of the extra added adapter to make it USB-C compatible.  Here I am 2 months after I bought it and the mousewheel no longer functions on this mouse as well.  For some reason the companies that make these portable mouse (mice?) cannot make one that has a sturdy mouse wheel.  Oddly enough, the one thing I didn't like about the mouse originally, became my favorite thing now that it is broken - the adapter to allow me to run regular USB on a USB-C port.",2022,08
Within a week of my son using it the scroll button broke. Somehow it’s outside the return window so now we are stuck with it.,2022,08
"I ordered 2 - the track ball broken in the silver one within 60 days, the right click broke on the rose gold one within 90 days. I only use them for light use - no gaming and they are not sturdy at all. They were both difficult to charge",2022,08
Skips around and freezes when clicking on things. Save your money!,2022,08
I’ve used it only for 6-7 times from Jan to July. Now it won’t on. Don’t buy,2022,08
This product is very cheaply made. I purchased this mouse because my daughter liked the lighting on the side of the mouse.  However the wheel that controls how you scroll up and down on a web page easily  breaks off and you have to return it or buy another one.  Buyer beware take it from a father who has went through 3 of them.,2022,08
I use this for my laptop mostly when I'm creating designs on my cricut. Works good! Lights up very nicely.,2022,06
I use this mouse for work. It didn’t require any weird setup like downloading software. It’s super comfy and has a sleep mode that activates after about 15 minutes. A click of the button wakes it up and it’s ready to go. I don’t regularly use the light up mode but it is a cool feature that is fun to show off. I have carpal tunnel and it’s so much better on my wrist than a standard wired computer mouse. Most definitely worth the purchase!,2022,08
The scroll wheels does not work on this mouse,2022,08
The mouse itself is great - works well. however the roller ball on the top of the mouse broke and no longer works. It has only been 6 weeks since purchase.I do like that the lights have an on/off function so you don't need to have it lit all the time which makes it more appropriate when in a work environment.,2022,08
I use this in class and at home and there is not any noise when you are clicking the buttons. Which is nice when we are quietly working on things. I would highly recommend! The color changing is also great!,2022,08
I guess almost a year for under $10 is good enough.  Especially if you want one that recharges because you don't like fooling around with AA batteries. Battery life was good. I could use it all day with no problems.,2022,08
"About 7 weeks, after return window closed, quit working completely. I should have returned sooner as the charge lasts only about one full work day. Spent a lot of time fooling around with a mouse, a tool that should be something you don’t have to think about or make plans to be available for use. Going back to tried and true battery wireless which lasts about a year and no hassle.",2022,08
Good,2022,08
It was most important to me to have a quiet scrolling mouse for my laptop. This mouse has quiet/silent scrolling and silent clicking. Very impressed! The mouse is more of a flat design. The lights around it are pretty neat. There is an on/off switch on the bottom of the mouse that includes an option for the lights as well. Nice mouse for a great price.,2022,08
It was fine until it just stopped working 3 months in. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get a well known brand like Logitech.,2022,08
"I bought five of them this year and three already broke after a few months of light use. Two had the plastic wheel axle broken, the another one just stopped charging and not recognized by Windows anymore. In addition, the USB dongle cover separated and got stuck in the laptop USB port. This mouse is flimsy and does not last. Not very ergonomical as well. Cool lights is the only positive thing to say about this mouse, but it eats battery. Avoid.",2022,08
"I Purchased this for my office work and it broke down after 2weeks, the scroll wheel stopped functioning. Be aware of this and look for something else with better quality.Thanks",2022,08
Do not recommend! Just purchased in June and it's already broken in August.,2022,08
"I have logitech keyboard that I use with no problem with my other mouse, but when i plug this mouse in, the keyboard stops working. The dongle is also hard to remove from the back of the mouse. I had to get something small to pry it out. I little space for your finger to grab it more easily would have been nice.",2022,08
Don't buy...Scroll not working,2022,08
"It’s rechargeable, and the battery lasts quite some time, of course I always turn it off once I’m done using it. But no more batteries. Comes with the charger as well. What more could you ask for!",2022,08
This mouse lasted 31 days just passed the returnable date.Just quite working no matter how many hours I let it recharge.,2022,08
Mouse will not work. I have only had it for about 45 days and the mouse just stopped working. Will not charge either.,2022,08
"I feel like I won this out of a cheap Gumball machine.  Plastic, doesn’t feel like it’s going to last long.",2022,08
"I ordered my first mouse, it broke in two weeks. Returned & reordered- this one broke just a few days after the return window closed. Don’t waste your money.",2022,08
So I loved this and I use a computer daily so you could say it is only intended for rare usage. It broke within the month. I was sad. Specifically the scrolling button.,2022,08
"LED Wireless Mouse, Rechargeable Slim Silent Mouse is easy to use, lightweight, and easy to recharge. The charge last a long time.",2022,08
"I was super excited to use this mouse for my MacBook, but it won't even charge. I would return, but do not have the packaging anymore. DO NOT BUY.",2022,08
"It does not move correctly. When you move the mouse the cursor doesn’t move same thing when you click on something, you have to click a million times before it opens up what your doing or closes what your doing.",2022,08
Ease of installing and very super cool looking at my laptop!,2022,08
I have been using this for less than a month and it doesn’t work. It doesn’t hold a charge.,2022,08
"This mouse has The Quietest click of any mouse I've ever owned. And it puts itself to sleep if I don't move it for a while. It's magical. I wasn't sure about the color changing light, but it's not overpowering or distracting. I've had a very long line of previous wireless mice, but I think this is my favorite. Very pleased with this purchase.",2022,08
Broke within two hours of using it you really gotta watch the Amazon return policy on electronics I have a tendency to buy it and I leave it sitting in the box for way too long.  Bad me because this is the second or third time I’ve gotten burned on crap like this.,2022,08
"Love this mouse! I got it to replace my Logitech mouse because it was glitching. You can’t beat the price for this one, it’s light weight, and the colors are nice!",2022,08
" The ergonomic feel of the mouse is great and the battery life is amazing. It is lightweight and feels cheap. White matches my setup but it’s translucent and takes way from the aesthetic. It is connected less than a ft away and it still loses connectivity which causes it to lag. It makes it completely useless to me. I don’t recommend you buy it, at least not the white one and be aware of the lagging.",2022,08
"Great product, very competitive price.",2022,08
I really like this. This is a replacement for a broken battery operated one I used to have. I love that this can charge from a USB port and I'm not having to rely on batteries or worry that they might run out at an inconvenient time. It's got cool lights around the side and it works well on a lot of surfaces. I use my laptop in a recliner chair and this works running on the edge of the chair just fine. I've also used it on wooden table top and vinyl countertop surfaces with good results. It does take just a second when the laptop boots up to locate but that's minimal. The USB wireless component is small and fits really inconspicuously into an unused port on my laptop without being in the way at all. All in all I've been very happy with the quality and efficiency. This was a great purchase.,2022,08
I have never used it because everything is in Chinese even the machine it self .,2022,08
I like that you change button on the back so it stays red and that the blue light stops showing once its done charging. The only thing is I wish it would show you how much battery it has left.,2022,08
Good for the price. It also doesn't make the typical mouse clicking sound. You can barely hear it.,2022,08
"I bought one to try for myself at home, and loved it so much I ordered two more to use at work. This is the best wireless mouse I've ever had. Great value, too!",2022,08
Precise! LED optional  ...  lightweight ~ mouse has a slot for Bluetooth and is rechargeable! No more batteries!Stellar with the 3M precision mouse pad,2022,08
"I didn't realize that it was rechargeable vs a battery.  However, it gets the job done and it comfortable to use.",2022,08
It looks great and feels good in the hand but the scroller broke after a couple months.,2022,08
"I was not fond of this mouse - the ergonomics too flat or charge life. Now after 5 months of average to minimum use it will not charge. My system gives an error message of ""malfunctioning device"". I tried a different USB cord with the same response.I DONOT RECOMMEND THIS MOUSE!",2022,08
"Exactly what I was looking for, but get a longer micro-USB to USB-A charging cable. The one it comes with is only about 3 inches long—just long enough to charge off your laptop.",2022,08
Appearance & size with built in charging.,2022,08
"Loved this mouse. Worked great. After having it for 4 months, the scrolling piece in the middle broke. I was not rough with it. I did not drop it. Just stopped working out of nowhere.",2022,08
I loved this product when I first received it. It lit up and lightweight and just pretty. But that was very short lived. It stopped working after just 2 weeks of using it. Good thing it was on the cheaper side. Maybe it was a disposable mouse that only was supposed to work for a short period?,2022,08
"Don't buy it! For one is very inconvenient rechargeable - you never know when mouse is out of juice. Two, mouse is dead after just 2 MONTHS",2022,08
I've had the product for less than two months and it no longer works. Really disappointed.,2022,08
Super sleek and super quiet. I love this mouse!!,2022,08
"I bought this a first time and after a few months it died completely, even after being charged it will not respond when turned back on. I thought it might just be a one time defect and bought another. This time it died completely after 1 month. Nice while it worked, but will not be buying a 3rd time.",2022,08
More technical trash,2022,08
"It’s lightweight, colorful, and it charges using a usb. No more changing out batteries. I love that!! It does go into sleep mode when I haven’t used it for a period of time (meaning it’s just idling). I haven’t found out how to wake it up so I just flip it over switch it off and on back again to resume using it.",2022,08
Worked great while it lasted. The roller wheel stopped working first week back to school after summer break.  The roller wheel just spins in place. One of the “arms” snapped. It has been kept in a protective pouch.,2022,08
"Love the LED lights, connects quickly. The rechargeable feature is great until you forget to recharge",2022,08
"I have small hands and my old mouse was too big for my hand.  This mouse is lower, so I don't need to move my wrist and fingers higher to click.  It's not a cure, but it's great that it fits my hand much better and doesn't put as much strain on my hand.",2022,08
nice comfy and also very smooth,2022,08
Should have had a usb-c charging port on it instead of micro USB. Otherwise it's great for my daughter's 5 year old hands.,2022,08
"Scrolling roller ball doesn’t function, just freely spins without engaging.",2022,08
"I bought this mouse and the thing barely moves across the screen not traction! It's very cheaply made, would not recommend at all! I needed one fast cause my old one is going I've had for years. This mouse will not last four years!",2022,08
"after 2 months of somewhat daily usage just for checking emails occasionally or something fast, the middle wheel stopped working making it a pain in my ass to use. I would recommend staying clear since it only has a 30-day warranty.",2022,08
"The mouse functions well. However, after a few days, I noticed that the multicolor lights no longer changes. I hope to find some way to fix it.",2022,08
"Bought this in June ... IT's DEAD. Plus when in wireless mode, frequently ... multiple times per day, the mouse drops connection. Cheap product, would rather have a working product!",2022,08
"The charge for this mouse only lasts a day. Very annoying. And it isnt the most quiet either. Feels cheap, performs meh. Dont waste your money.",2022,08
Not functional for gaming if the charge doesn't last.,2022,08
It works great & is fast.,2022,08
I love how cute this mouse is.  I use it for work.  It goes into sleep mode pretty quickly but one click and you're back up and running! I charge it once a week.,2022,08
"When my 5 year old wired mouse finally died I started looking at replacement options.  I have never liked wireless mice due to the constant need for batteries and finding some in the office or while traveling is always a huge pain.  Finding out that there are rechargeable options out there was a game changer.  So far after about two weeks of use I love feel of the mouse, the pointer speed which is adjustable, and well the fact that I just plug it in to charge.  While the receiver is USB A and comes with an adapter for USB C, the charging port on the mouse is micro USB, the charging cable that comes with is USB A to micro USB (~6 inches) incase you want a longer one like I did.  One thing though, I do have small hands so the size is perfect, someone with small to medium sized hands will like the feel and size of the mouse, if you have large hands it may feel to small.All in all I liked it so much I ordered a 2nd one for my work laptop bag to replace the wired mouse that I travel with.",2022,08
"Not worth it, I had this for only 3 months and it broke. It just stopped working, I could not scroll at all no matter what I did. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Then after contacting Amazon I was charged a 2 dollar restocking fee, for them and had to send it back on my own.",2022,08
The different colored lights stopped working after a week and it only had a red light. After two months the mouse stopped working entirely. Sucks because it's too late to return it,2022,08
great product,2022,08
"I really like this mouse, it is low profile and fits my small hands perfectly. The only thing I really don't like about it is all the flashes of different color lights on it. I need to check to see if there is a way to disable the light feature. Otherwise, a very nice mouse !!!",2022,08
Scroll button stopped working within 2 weeks,2022,08
Won't hold a charge,2022,08
"This mouse is wonderful to use for precise things such as line drawing and making flow charts.  It is super comfortable to use.  Unfortunately,  I bought this at the beginning of the year and now it will not charge, so I basically now have a corded mouse which is what I needed to avoid.  So, until I find a highly rated cordless, or a battery operated one, I will be tied to the computer (literally)",2022,08
I started using this product exactly a month ago. It will not work now unless it’s plugged into the charger. Which defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse. Can’t recommend.,2022,08
I bought this for work..I had it maybe couple of weeks and it stopped working..couldn't get it to hold a charge..,2022,08
"The mouse worked well for 1 day, but nowhere cursor is non-responsive. I checked to make sure it was fully charged, did some troubleshooting, and moved the USB to multiple ports on the laptop. Nothing worked. I'm guessing I just received a dud? Or maybe the mouse just isn't compatible with my laptop? I've used multiple wireless mouses with this laptop; this is the first time I've ever had an issue. Make sure you try the mouse out right away (after charging) upon receiving it (incase it doesn't work and needs to be returned).",2022,08
Stopped working in about an hour.,2022,08
The mouse worked for a couple weeks but now the scroller just spins freeling and won’t scroll one through pages. Really disappointed because the mouse as a whole worked pretty well for the last couple weeks. Hopefully just a defective model. Will be returning the item and seeking a replacement,2022,08
" Light pink, quiet when I click. Smooth across my mouse pad and does not get stuck. LED lights change often. All as advertised from my concern.",2022,08
Does all the things a mouse should.  The sleep mode is a nice touch.,2022,08
Worked great...for a month then the center button stopped working.,2022,08
It was working well until it just stopped working after 3 months. It won’t charge and turn on anymore pretty much useless now. Not well made and it’s a waste of money if you’re looking for a reliable and and an item that will last long do not get this one coz you will be disappointed. I tried my luck and didn’t listen to the reviews I read now I am so disappointed. Could have spend $10 more to a most reliable and long lasting one.,2022,08
I charged this mouse one time for an hour and it’s been going for a month now on that one charge. The clicks are silent. I love this comfortable mouse!Edit: loved it until the scroll wheel stopped working.,2022,08
Scroll bar broke a month after getting it.,2022,08
Purchased for daughter and she didn’t like the ergonomics of it. I threw it in my work travel bag and have ended up using it. Works well and battery lasts a while. It’s also a nice conversation piece in meetings ;-),2022,08
"I tried to give this mouse some time. I tried it on different surfaces. In all cases it skipped around and was very hard to work with. Unfortunately,  because of vacation and because I tried to make it work,  I missed the return window…., By one day! That just frustrates me even more.",2022,08
"I purchased this in February 2022, it began tracking poorly in July and stopped scrolling in August.",2022,08
"Was decent first month, very flat so not ergonomic but that's personal taste. Issue is this is already broken. The scroll wheel no longer works.....even for a $10 mouse, that's pretty pathetic since I've had other mouses for years at a time. I had the same issue as other reviews with the cursor randomly jumping too so there might be some design issue with the sensor.",2022,08
"This mouse was purchased for a 10 year old girl.  She loves the colors, the fit, and the fact that it works without making noise.",2022,08
I bought this 5 weeks ago and now the scroll doesn't work.  If you need a mouse choose something other than this.,2022,08
Junk,2022,08
don't spend your money on this crap,2022,08
"I am very happy with this mouse, the colors are interesting and the fact that I don't have to buy batteries is an added plus!!",2022,08
Perfect,2022,08
It says it is supposed to install hardware automatically and should work once completed however that is not the case for mine and it doesn't tell me what should be installed for me to try to find it on my own,2022,08
I hate this product,2022,08
Bought this on Prime day and it does not disappoint!  The silent click and long charge life is great.  Love the sleep mode and the slim feel.  Will be buying another one.,2022,08
"After two days of using , the mouse went dead and would not work again no matter how long I charged it .",2022,08
"I'd gotten a mouse/ mouse pad combo at TJ Maxx, but there was no usb to connect it to my laptop-- so i ordered this online. It was a good price and shipped quickly, and I am so glad I ordered it. It's way cooler than the other one I bought and feels like it's made better. It lights up, there's an on/off and sleep mode to preserve battery. Also works so seamlessly and smooth. Great product, thanks!",2022,08
I received this product in the mail and when first handled it felt very cheap.. I proceeded to use it on my laptop and the mouse wheel wasn’t working at all,2022,08
"the mouse itself was fine at first, worked great and i liked the shape and sound. but the wheel started to squeak, and it always scrolled too fast for my liking. and now the mouse won’t work at all, always jumping around the screen, spinning, lagging, or unresponsive. really annoying when i’m trying to play games. it does this when the battery is getting low too. not a fan. it works sometimes flat on my desktop but then it slowly gets worse and worse as the night goes on. and now it won’t even read on my mousepad at all? it HAS to be on the desktop to make it work, even poorly.",2022,08
"I really loved this mouse.  I did not replace it with the same mouse, however because the wheel broke.  I only use this device M-F for work.  I'm not a gamer or anything like that.  I've had wireless mice that do not break for years previously.  Great color, very cool looking.  Will miss using this.  Not sure if there is any warranty",2022,08
"I liked everything about this mouse, was working great the couple of times a week that I used it. Then one day… the scroll wheel stopped working completely. No it’s not dirty, there is no resistance it feels like it is free wheeling in there. No explanation. Past “return period.”",2022,08
Be sure your computer is on in order to see the lights on the white mouse :) was so close to returning it as my other mouse with lights was always on regardless of my computer. But glad I problem solved my own problem!,2022,08
"might work for low use, we shall see and I'll update this review after a week or so of use.Update: received 11Aug  mouse died 22Sep RIP",2022,08
Cute mouse . . . I just love how it lights up with the different colors.,2022,08
It worked for about 3 weeks plus afew days before it stopped working.,2022,08
It had worked very well for me for about 2 years and it’s very aesthetic!,2022,08
"Mouse worked fine for two weeks. Shape took some getting used to since it’s low profile. Charge held up pretty well. BUT the scroll wheel broke after a few weeks of use, so in the trash it goes.",2022,08
"It is quite nice, it has an interesting style and the colored lights give it a special touch, unfortunately in terms of performance is lousy, the sleep mode seems to fail constantly, sometimes it turns off for no reason and stops working for a while (being fully charged) so it must be damaged internally. Very disappointed with this product, no matter how nice it is it is not worth buying if it does not fulfill its main function.",2022,08
The scrolling wheel is already broken and havent even used the mouse for a month.,2022,08
Love how Amazon is fast and product is great,2022,08
It’s honestly awful it won’t charge and I’ve tried four different chargers.,2022,08
Great purchase,2022,08
"Pretty easy to use and set up, comes with a charger. I expected the lights to be a bit more appealing but they’re mainly just solid colors when you have it on the led light mode. Fits snug with my hands and does the job for the most part so complain. Probably wouldn’t use for gaming purposes though.",2022,08
"Nice mouse -- if it worked! The first one I purchased worked for about a month. When the scrolling wheel broke, the company replaced it, free of charge. Now, six months later, the second one has quit working; won't hold a charge.",2022,08
I love it,2022,08
"My son wanted this for his Macbook, so I will tell you it needs an adapter. The Macbook doesn’t have a USB port. But after that he is pleased with the performance. He uses it to play games too and says it is responsive.",2022,08
Mouse is easy to use and works well. However the first time I put it in my bag the color chipped off the mouse. Now I have a teal mouse with white specks. Super disappointed,2022,08
This is the cheapest thing I have ever seen the quality is horrible! Holding it in my hand feels like it weighs nothing it is extremely cheap. The lights are neat tho. They should be ashamed selling this for anymore then 2$,2022,08
Literally will not charge or hold a charge,2022,08
This mouse only worked for one charging. When I charged it the  second time everything works backwards. want to go left it goes right your want it to go up it goes down. I DON'T  recommend this item they say you can't return it.,2022,08
Charge didn’t last all day and then delay kept getting longer. I simply don’t have time to hook it to a cord and there’s no battery charge option.,2022,08
Stops working a week after buying do not waste your money. Mine won’t stay connected to my computer constantly having to reconnect it,2022,08
It broke literally less than a month and ive never even dropped it. Super disappointed and waste of money.,2022,08
"I used this very infrequently, and the spinning wheel broke within a couple months.",2022,08
Great product but a little too flat for me.,2022,08
My son was using it for his laptop for school and it stopped working didn’t want to work nomore .,2022,08
I don't use for gaming,2022,08
"I'm not too happy with this LED MOUSE, when it goes on sleep mode, I have to literally turn it off and turn it back on to boot up again. I'm thinking of returning it and get a full refund on this product.",2022,08
Mouse works well and holds a charge for several 8 hour work days. Only drawback for me is that the scroll wheel is loud.,2022,08
"After exactly two months the roller wheel in the middle broke. I tried prying it apart and it is not fixable and is a pain to always have to use the scrollbar with the mouse. The lights are kind of distracting & not necessary. However, it does stay charged for a week or more at a time. I'm cheap and bought this for data work. It works (other than the middle wheel now) and is okay for the price or if you don't have high expectations.",2022,08
Easy to use and lite weight. I will purchase another one soon,2022,08
"if you want an led mouse for aesthetics, dont buy this brand.this has a flashing red led that is seperate from the rgb leds, & it stays on even when the led switch is not on.",2022,08
"I tried charging the mouse but it didn’t want to charge, tried multiple cables and nothing, light kept switching and when i plugged the adapter in it didn’t pop up or recognized it.",2022,08
"Cheap, flimsy components and the charge lasts about 20 minutes.",2022,08
This mouse is wonderful!  I love the feel of it. It is ergonomically great. I use a mouse all day long and this mouse is light weight and fits my hand. The sleep mode feature is an added plus.,2022,08
Piece of crap,2022,08
Have not even had the item for three weeks and it has stopped connecting.  It was going strong for about a week and then all of a sudden it began to have problems.  I do believe that the mouse is very cheaply made!  Spend a few extra dollars and get a quality product!,2022,08
"Loved the idea of recharging. Had to charge midday, sometimes. Wheel randomly died in the middle of my workday after 8 months.Buying a regular one next time.",2022,08
Is very easy to manager.,2022,08
"It stopped working after 1-2 Weeks. The lights would appear and it looked like it would charge, but the mouse was nonresponsive to movement. It worked for a week or two before this happened, so I know how it was supposed to work before it stopped working. The surface felt silky to the touch, but that's about the only plus I can give this product. As cool as the lights look, I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this. Invest a little extra and go with a more reputable and reliable brand that won't break after 1-2 weeks. I'll be doing the same after this disappointment.",2022,08
Pretty good mouse!,2022,08
Easy and fits my hand. I have some numbness in my right hand.,2022,08
The scroll wheel stopped working 38 days after I bought it.  I used it less than 20 times,2022,08
"DON'T BUY IT. IT CAN'T HOLD A CHARGE, IT MOVES ON IT'S OWN, AND WAS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR HOW CRAPPY IT WAS.",2022,08
Red lights stays on and nothing happens.  Really like this mouse until this happened.,2022,08
Slim in the hand and works great!,2022,08
Stopped working from one day to the next.,2022,06
Really liked how light weight the product is however it stopped working after 2 months. The battery life was great in the beginning but now it doesn't operate even after charging it.,2022,08
"Don’t buy, died as soon as the return period is over! Can’t get a refund for it",2022,08
"I have been using this mouse for 9 days and the scroll wheel broke completely when I pressed it. It was alright in its short 9 days, comfortable. But the scroll wheel clicked very loudly which I didn’t like.Don’t waste your money.",2022,08
"Cute mouse! I love the blue on it, and the lights are a cute touch. Its very lightweight! Very quiet! no clicking sounds from the mouse which is great.",2022,07
"This mouse is super cute! It is lightweight, and the color matched perfectly to the picture (I got dark gray to match my Macbook Pro). The click is silent, which I love. The LED lights are bright and colorful. There is also a setting where you can just have red lights, but I love the color changing. The only downside is that this mouse does not hold a charge long enough to last my entire workday. I've started switching it off when I am away from my desk, and that help some. Charging is simple, though.",2022,07
"I loved the look and feel of this mouse. However, it stopped working after only a week of using. It won’t charge at all and a coworker said she had the same issue with the same mouse. Don’t waste your money!",2022,07
"I was pleased to see just how well made the mouse was when I received it. I couldn't have asked for more for the money. It's comfortable in my hand. The rubber texture really makes using it a pleasure. The dongle storage on the bottom of the mouse isn't covered, but it's nice and tight, so I'm not worried about losing it. So far so good!",2022,07
It works smoothly and the colors are fun. Keeps charged for a good while.,2022,07
"Do not buy! This mouse stopped working August 1st, yesterday, I thought it was just dead so I made sure to charge it. This morning I go to use the mouse and it still is not working, despite it being fully charged. It just doesn't turn on anymore. I am extremely disappointed because I just bought this mouse on June 29th, meaning that the return window closed on July 29th. This mouse stopped working entirely (doesn't even turn on anymore) two days after the return window closed. Do not buy this product!!! If I could give it less stars I would.",2022,07
Loved by Medical assistants throughout my office.,2022,07
While working on my desk a close by book fell on top of the mouse and now it doesn’t take charge. By the way it was the first day Zi was using it.,2022,07
"if you leave the mouse unactive for a minute or two you have to turn the mouse off and back on or the mouse will lag, skip across the screen as you try to move the mouse around. It is extremely annoying.",2022,07
Wet sleek and love the silent clicks and the lights.very satisfied with it,2022,07
"This came with an adaptor to fit the Apple laptop, but is not made specifically for Apple products. The charge does not last long and needs a special adaptor. I prefer a battery operated mouse as maintaining so many different chargers on my desk is cumbersome.  The three settings for on off are also less than ideal. In summary, while this mouse is aesthetically pretty, it is not functional with the Apple products.",2022,07
Quality was not worth it! Stopped working unexpectedly,2022,07
I love it. Easy to install and use. Mouse is soft and movies easily.,2022,07
From what I'd read this would plug into an android tablet I have so that I could control without using the touch-screen. But the adaptor did not allow this. My mistake probably.,2022,07
The mouse broke a couple days after the return window. Reached out and heard nothing back. Not fun throwing money away like that.,2022,07
It stopped working after three and a half months. The scroll button stopped working.,2022,07
"Update - I lost my favorite mouse today. I bought it on Jun 12, 2022, reviewed it Aug 1, 2022, and it died yesterday, Aug 2, 2022. So the mouse lasted appx 11 weeks. Two and a half months is a pretty disappointing lifespan. The battery died so I plugged it in, as always, yet it doesn't connect anymore. I've tried removing the USB transmitter, rebooting the computer, plunging it in and out, and turning it off and on, but nothing. I even tried 're-charging' it, but nope. It's a lost cause.I bought this mouse to replace the wireless Logitech I was using for my laptop. It died and I decided to try this rechargeable mouse from OKIMO. I never heard of the brand but I'm impressed.This first charge lasted so long that I almost forgot it was rechargeable. I bought it in mid-June (It's Aug 1, 2022 today) and I'm just on my second charge. The first charge lasted over a month.This mouse does shut off after it's idle for a while and I'm sure that is the secret to the long battery life. Just a quick left click and it's back in business almost immediately.I love the slim feel of this mouse. It works beautifully.I thought the changing light would bother me (I'm old - 57) but it doesn't. It's more like a pleasant subdued highlight effect.I'll probably buy another one for my desktop but in another color so I don't get them mixed up.",2022,07
Has not even been two weeks and it stopped working. I have it charging it’ll light up blue then it turns off within A minute,2022,07
"Great for the price, hold charge for a good amount of time",2022,07
This lasts quite a while before requiring plug in!,2022,07
It is exactly as pictured. works well.,2022,07
 Aesthetically this is very enjoyable to use because of the changing colors of the rainbow. I like how it's wireless and it can even work from a small distance away on another table from separate from my computer. It works very well. It has an on and off button for storage.,2022,07
Just love the narrow band of changing colors around the mouse. It's so cheerful.,2022,07
"I love the ease of use with this mouse, the ability to charge it rather than constantly replace batteries, and to shut off or put to sleep the noise. It's durable and perfect for my usage, and I was able to get it in Pink!",2022,07
It works,2022,07
"This thing works well most of the time. If you don’t turn it off and just let it go to sleep mode, it dies fairly quickly but you still get a couple of days of use out of it (if you’re not using it 8 hours a day, at least). If you turn it off every time you’re done though you can get probably a month but at least 2 weeks out of it with moderate use. I originally bought it to use with my iPad, however the case on my iPad wouldn’t really allow the USB-C to plug into the charger port. I wish they made an option to get either a USB or a USB-C plug as you get both with this mouse but you have to plug the USB into the USB-C adapter which makes the USB-C plug significantly thicker than necessary. Now I use it for my MacBook. Just a warning, if you want it to scroll like a regular mouse you have to change it in the setting of the computer (but that’s a MacBook problem not a problem with this mouse, not all of Apple’s setting decisions make sense but that’s nothing new). I do really like that I can chose to just turn on the mouse with a solid red color (which preserves battery) or turn it on to change colors (reduces how much time you get out of the mouse but is a cool feature). My only complaint is that sometimes the mouse isn’t tracking perfectly and the cursor is in a completely different place than I would expect it to be (further behind where I was moving it to rather than the cursor doing its own thing), but that may also be a thing I have to change on the laptop.",2022,07
Does not work,2022,07
It’s very cute looks chic. Now I can find my mouse at night with out a problem.🙂,2022,07
"Does not hold charge, dead after 5 months of use.",2022,07
"I've been using Logitech Marble Mice for years, maybe over a decade.  I just love that you control the cursor with just your fingertips.  But it's weakness is that the Marble Mouse's scrolling function is clumsy and jerky as it lacks a legit scroll wheel.  That is probably the sole reason I bought this LED wireless mouse.The LED mouse seems to function well.  It has a sleep mode that easily wakes up and had a pretty color light around it.  I don't use it for general mousing, but for scrolling.  Once i get the cursor in the right window the mouse can be on the desk, in my lap. wherever.  It makes up for what I don't have with my Marble Mouse.  The price was right and I think if it's what I paid for it it's a good, cheap addition.",2022,07
the mouse can use but the back side of the light  is broke .,2022,07
This mouse is extremely lightweight and easy to use. I love the lights that constantly change while you're using it. The best part for me is the fact that it's rechargeable...just plug it into any USB (I plug it into my laptop at the end of the day) battery usually lasts me a few full days of work. Sleep mode is great and helps prolong battery life.,2022,07
I love it !!!!,2022,07
Works well light weight,2022,07
Been trying this for over a month now and have only used it a handful of times because the charge barely last 3 hours at most even after a full charge. Save your money,2022,07
Easy to setup fit nice on the palm of your hand,2022,07
A flimsy mouse that broke down within two months of very light use. I would recommend spending a bit more money and buy a branded mouse and have peace of mind.,2022,07
"I bought the white one and at first it was only lighting up red and thought the picture was misleading. I then realized the on/off switch on the bottom actually serves two functions. One click on will turn the mouse on and glowing red. Two clicks on and the rainbow colors appear. I will say the white mouse is almost translucent, the rainbow colors illuminate the whole mouse, not just the sides. It's plug and play, very easy to use and comfortable.",2022,07
"This is probably my second review in life because I hate leaving them. But I'm very disappointed that the scroll wheel stopped working right after a month of use. I don't even use it every day. Hell, I don't even use it every other day, so this definite came as a shock. Of course, the return window is closed, which go figure when you sell a cheap mouse and the seller isn't easily accessible. I'd like to think out of good character and business that I would be able to replace this mouse as I love the color and the lights on it, but what's the point if it no longer serves its purpose ???",2022,07
"Colors are just ok, I have to position the charger a certain way for it to actually charge.",2022,07
This crapped out within three months. Invest in a better quality mouse. So tedious having to replace these cheap electronics so often!,2022,07
Liked it a lot until it stopped working after only using it intermittently for a couple months.  No longer will right click,2022,07
Beats having to contend with the wire of a wired mouse; as well as having to use your finger on the little laptop control surface.,2022,07
Great purchase!!! It’s so cute and easy to handle!!,2022,07
I initially liked this mouse because it’s cute. It’s too flat to be ergonomic but that was okay. Except I’ve used it for less than a month and the scroll wheel has fallen off its track. It also dies very fast and needs to be recharged often. I don’t recommend it for anyone using a mouse regularly.,2022,07
Made to seamlessly fit hands. A pleasure to use.,2022,07
"My mouse never worked. I charged it the first day for the recommended time. When I tried to use it, it powered on briefly and then powered completely off. I thought it must not have charged completely. So I charged it again, and again, and again. Each time, it did the same thing. I just threw it away. Never even got to use it.",2022,07
Does not hold a charge. Have to recharge every three days approximately.,2022,07
its been less than 3 months but the mouse has already popped open and doesn’t work. I just wish it would last longer.,2022,07
this mouse last me like a month or two . im not able to scroll up using this mouse . will not buy again,2022,07
"Very comfortable to use,  love it",2022,07
"I ordered this mouse in the light blue color for an eight year old girl. The mouse works well, and she loves the bright and changing colors. Highly recommend!",2022,07
Bought this mouse in March and today it stopped working. It will not charge and is now useless.,2022,07
"Battery life was great, worked great for a while, but it will not charge. First time I went to charge it, I plug it into my laptop and a power brick, it lights up for 3 seconds, then shuts off. Now it won't turn on at all. Sadly, I would love to give this product more stars, but now this is useless and I can't even use it while it's plugged in.",2022,07
"Great to use, quite clicks, and looks very cool!",2022,07
"This mouse is slimmer than others, since I have a small hand, it is very comfortable to use.Great buy !!",2022,07
Super cute! But it is really slow.,2022,07
this is an update to my last review.  It has been 4 months and it stopped working!I bought this because of the price and color.Next time I will go with a more reputable company....,2022,07
The c type adapter doesnt work.,2022,07
"Nothing wrong with this mouse, does the job. I use with new laptop.",2022,07
"Simple book up and very responsive. Sturdy construction, beautiful light display and worth every penny. Just as good, if not better, than the more expensive brands.",2022,07
Worked well for a few months now scroll doesn't work,2022,07
"The mouse is ergonomic, very easy to use. The price is not bad either all in all good purchase.",2022,07
" I LOVE this mouse! It’s super cute and lightweight, I love the led lights option. Paired perfectly with my MacBook",2022,07
"I ordered this in early June and really enjoyed the fun color and sleek design.  However now, in late July, about 1 1/2 months later first the USB transmitter broke off and got stuck in my laptop and then the mouse itself stopped charging and no longer works.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Look elsewhere!",2022,07
It works great.  Like the color.,2022,07
"People are right this is a rip off. Waste of money , it only worked for a week. Wow",2022,07
So far so good.  Looks cool and feels good.  Would buy again,2022,07
This mouse absolutely sucks. I've tried charging it and the blue light appears then after 2 minutes it goes out. I plugged it in at 11 a.m. and 3 hours later it's still dead. And they sent it to me again and it keeps happening. It doesn't charge and it doesn't work it's just cheap plastic don't get it.,2022,07
"Battery doesn't last long and sleep mode is annoying so I tossed it. Without warning, it will just quit on you. Going back to battery brand.",2022,07
This mouse is of great quality,2022,07
I use for work it is needing to be charged almost every 3-4 days.,2022,07
"Cheap for a reason, doesnt work after 2 months. I guess that is why the return policy is just 30 days. Do not waste your time on this item. Complete garbage.",2022,07
Purchased May 4th and USB broke apart by July 15th - save your money.,2022,07
i am sick with stage 4 melonoma so i just opened it.  it jiggles.  junk,2022,07
This item came broken. We tried charging it over night but it never worked. Had to return it,2022,07
It never would charge?,2022,07
Right button defective after 1 month usage.,2022,07
Working great. Plugged in or wireless I have no problem so far,2022,07
This mouse is very quiet when you click and is ergonomically comfortable.,2022,07
Works well special features are fun,2022,07
"Bought this mouse, because when my other one died, I remember having to change my battery at least once a month. After getting this, originally charged, and has kept the charge for almost a month now, and just had to recharge for the 1st time. Charged overnight, and working great again. LOVE THIS!!!! small, quiet mouse, easy to hold with a rubberized texture that keeps it from slipping.",2022,07
"If you want to have to charge a mouse more than use it, this product is for you. I had moderate hopes, but this mouse falls short of even those",2022,07
"Yeah, this thing is pretty great honestly. It works really well and is completely silent which I really like at work. I don’t like to be constantly clicking all the time. The rubberized feel is also very satisfying, and I mean very satisfying. Overall, you really can’t go wrong here for the price.",2022,07
"The mouse is cute, has quiet clicks, smooth glide, and is light.  It is also comfortable for your hand.  Like the rechargeable feature, as well",2022,07
If u not right hand suggest don’t buy it,2022,06
I really like the design and feel of this mouse.  I bought 2 in a week!  The lights are cool and I like the sleep feature if it's not used for 10 minutes.  Great price!!,2022,07
Worked fine out of the box until it needed recharging and now won't charge.  It has a blue light on it so I know it's getting power but as soon as I disconnect the cord it's dead.  Worthless.,2022,07
mouse not working properly .,2022,07
"It can also be ""jumpy"" on the pointer. I use it with Linux, so I can't configure it.",2022,07
It’s good size shape mouse. Let’s see how long it last. In my son Gand if it’s not brand name don’t last more then 5 to 10 week.,2022,07
"Waste of money, never charged and never worked. Waited to late to return so it'll go in the trash.",2022,07
The slim design fits well in my small hands,2022,07
"It works well functionality wise for me, but the lights don't work. It just stays red and the light is very blinky/jittery",2022,07
I love using this mouse. It recharges fast and it lasts for days. It's quiet and my wrist didn't hurt after using it for a while.,2022,07
I like this mouse very much.  It moves smoothly and is small so there is no discomfort for my hand.  The only thing I do not like is the on/off switch.  It is very small and hard to make it move.,2022,07
"It is almost perfect escept the assembly gap is big, some dust, dirt & tiny food waste will go in easily",2022,07
It would've been nice if this actually worked.,2022,07
"Very nice sleek design. Was expecting a lot more given the reviews, but mouse stopped working after 2-3 weeks. The USB and USB-c adaptors are very flimsy and prone to bending, so as soon as I go to plug it into my computer it does not connect. Definitely would not recommend unless you are looking for a product to use for about a week or two.",2022,07
Slim design. Comfortable for the wrist.,2022,07
I like that when you don’t use it cuts off for you and it’s long lasting when charged,2022,07
This stopped functioning after one week of use.,2022,07
It broke,2022,07
Had this one for 1 week and it already stopped working. The scroll wheel in the middle doesn't work and half the time the items I am trying to click on I can't because the left click button doesn't work. I have charged it several times from the computer and from a wall adapter and still not any better,2022,07
"Worked for less than a month,  it won't charge. Real piece of junk. Not a great product.",2022,07
WORKS GREAT,2022,07
"Use it with my laptop, works perfectly.",2022,07
Quiet clicker,2022,07
works great,2022,07
"Mouse works great,  better than expected.",2022,07
"It's good but for gaming, I don’t recommend this slim one. It's ok for normal work.",2022,07
Excellent price an very comfortableThere are great,2022,07
Love it...good price and product.,2022,07
"At first, this mouse was the best ever. However, whenever it touches a table, the bottom red light turns on and makes the colors look all messed up. It was still very comfortable, though. However, 2-3 months later, whenever I turned it on, it would start autoclicking, and the only way to stop it is to remove the USB charger. It's great for the first months but then started failing me.",2022,07
"The scroll wheel stopped working after 1 month, very frustrated.",2022,07
I am very disappointed with this item. I had replaced it once and the same thing happened where it doesn't hold a charge after a few months of ownership. I really like this product but the cool rainbow changing lights can only be enjoyed when its charged and working properly.,2022,07
Very satisfied with this mouse.,2022,07
"I bought this because it looked small and exactly what I was looking for. When I received it, I turned it on and it lit up. I got excited to only put it to charge and it completely stopped lighting up. I tried everything to no avail, it either fried during charging or just quit working. Either way, I returned it and got my money back.",2022,07
"First one received only lasted one week, but the return process was quick. I do really like the second one mainly because of the lights...I know, shallow right?",2022,07
"Smooth mouse ,moves nice , great fit . Luv the lights .nice bonus .",2022,07
"Absolutely love it! So slick, slim and smooth!",2022,07
Like the feel and options in this mouse. Happy with purchase,2022,07
Works great for home office and gaming,2022,07
"Just hit, but it is cheaply made. Should hv purchased from best buy vs this one.",2022,07
"The wheel/button broke as it was simply built with a thin plastic rod.  Sent it back, hard pass.",2022,07
Leave it for a few minutes and come back it has to be turned off and back on. Needs FREQUENT recharging.,2022,07
The product seemed good and I liked it until I was just using it normally then it just stopped working I tried charging it turning it off and on and reconnecting it but it still didn't work. I would not recommend this to anyone and I've had it only a couple of weeks.,2022,07
"I bought this mouse because it was rechargeable. It worked fine for a few days, and then just quit working. I ended up having to return it.",2022,07
"This is not for an adult hand, this is better suited for a child’s hand. It also does pretty quickly. It’s very uncomfortable to use and totally not worth it. Even at the lightning price I bought it at.",2022,07
"Starting using on April 2, and when I came back to my desk yesterday it had completely stopped working. I can not charge it (i tried on multiple computers) and the computers won’t acknowledge it if it’s not plugged in directly (which defeats the purpose of the wireless chargeable mouse.Don’t buy if you are looking for a long term option.And I can’t find a way to contact the company. The only option Amazon gives me is to leave a review. I can not contact the seller.",2022,07
I got this almost a month ago and only had to charge it once since then.,2022,07
I use it flowering from home in my laptop l,2022,07
"This is a quick, responsive and easy to use mouse.It can be run normally or with it's built in lights. I sleeps after a short period of unuse but wakes with a single click.A micro USB charging cable (included) charges the mouse in no time. Light is on when charging and turns off when done. With the sleep mode, the battery lasts longer than expected.",2022,07
Works well with windows 11,2022,07
Not very comfy and always disconnected,2022,07
Super smooth operation and super quiet. Excellent battery life. I was very pleasantly surprised. Would not hesitate to purchase a second one or even recommend to someone. Great price.,2022,07
So far I’m very pleased with this product. It connected with my laptop automatically with no problems. The slim line design slips into my laptop case outer pocket very nicely and there seems to be no issues with charging it from a computer port.,2022,07
I like that it’s rechargeable. Unfortunately the scroller on top doesn’t work. I used with both my MacBook and Laptop.,2022,07
I bought this mouse for very light useIt work perfect the first week once I Had to recharge it never turn on againBad quality,2022,07
"Return back in 30days, the 31st day it doesn’t work .how did you make it?",2022,07
Good quality for the price very colorful constantly changing colors. Easy to connect to the computer. Great item!!!,2022,07
Best mouse I’ve ever bought.,2022,07
On-off switch too small. I like the way it lights up. I was always leaving the old mouse on.Add a written review,2022,07
I have had this mouse for less than 3 months that and the rolling ball has stopped working. That sucks.,2022,07
"this mouse is completely useless.the instruction manual has so many typos in it. its not even proper english. even the bottom of the mouse says ""for home and OFFLCE"" use. what??? (see picture)the usb receiver is hidden in the bottom of the mouse. IT DOESNT COME OUT. (see picture) it needs to be plugged into the computer for the mouse to work, but it doesnt come out. i tried everything. i tried to pry it out with my fingernail, nope. tried a pen, nope. i even tried to push it to see if it would pop out, nope. and of course the user manual doesnt explain anything.dont waste your money like i did.",2022,07
Just what I wanted  battery life tbd,2022,07
"I purchased this mouse on prime day, received a mouse that does not work.. no matter what I try. About to send back for a refund. Please don't waste your time purchasing this item. I wish I could relate to the good reviews, I am so disappointed.",2022,07
"Recently purchased this mouse. The look of the lights is cool, I'm not a fan of the sleep mode but I did love the smooth feel of movement and the track wheel was perfect. However, after a day and half, went to charge it and it never came back on. I thought it needed to charge longer, but no. Just stopped working.",2022,07
"I bought this last year not wanting to pay for a premium mouse, and after seeing so many comments. Turns out it's a mistake. The mouse stops working after a few months when i work from home. The pointer just doesn't react at all only the scroll works. If it's a functional mouse it's actually quite well made and I like the design overall. My kid loves the color. Sadly I have to put on this review.",2022,07
Great product.  My daughter loves it.,2022,07
I work in a fast paced setting.  Being able to un-dock and move; I needed something small to transport - this fut my need. I actually bought two.  I may buy more for my team.,2022,07
Great little mouse! It does not tell you that it is about to die though and you have to plug it in to charge it (no batteries) which will slow you down if working or gaming with it.,2022,07
"I purchased 2, one for my desktop and one for my laptop. Received them both on June 1, 2022. The scrolling wheel on one stopped working on July 7, 2022 and the scrolling wheel on the other one stopped working on July 16, 2022.",2022,07
"The mouse is so smooth and responsive. When it died, it wouldn’t take a charge so is now useless. About what I expected for being so cheap $. Pretty color though.",2022,07
Dead in 2 weeks,2022,07
"feels nice in the hand.  Lightweight, but not lightly made, if that makes sense.  Smooth flow, nice to have the usb compartment inside of the mouse.  I use it for my latop when I travel",2022,07
"While the shape of this rechargable mouse is nice, the crappy battery refused to be recharged after less than three months. Don't buy this!",2022,07
"I bought this mouse so that I could use it with my MacBook. Unfortunately it barely works, I have tried for a year now to get it to different surfaces and different ways to try and make it function better but it’s extremely slow and very glitchy and ends up slowing you down so much more than just using whatever mouse pad is on the laptop. It’s extremely lightweight and made from cheap plastic, I was expecting that at least it would work but the lag time is so great that you’re better off not using it at all.",2022,07
Skip it,2022,07
I chose this mouse because it lit up like the rest of my accessories. However the lights are so dim they are barely noticeable. It’s extremely light weight however I feel it is going to break easily since the plastic is so thin. So far for gaming I’ve had no issues with performance of the mouse itself.,2022,07
Bought it in March and now the roller thing does NOT work. Mouse was never dropped. I opened and found that the attachment of the roller is broken.It works as intended and I love that it is rechargeable.I'll buy another one. If it lasts long enough then maybe the first one is just a fluke.,2022,07
"The mouse works great - until it goes to sleep! Agggh!!! Then you have to shake, tap hard, (against your palm so you don't smash it to pieces!), or flip the switch back and forth. It's quite irritating. If it was as simple as on and off, it would be perfect.",2022,07
"Well it's a mouse but doesn't recharge. Has a stupid little white old tech mini USB. Looks like it's charging but it's not.This mouse was so thin it hurt to use for long periods, but only lasted till the battery died, has a charger but it won't recharge. Used multiple cables",2022,07
It is sleek I don’t care that it Hass to be charged every night my other mouse rarely has to be charged I went back to that one so I do not care for this mouse,2022,07
This sister last 10 uses,2022,07
SEE TITLE...JUNK..FEELS POOR IN YOUR HAND...IF A NO STAR BUTTON I WOULD RATE IT 0. DISAPOINTED,2022,07
"I enjoyed the look and watching this mouse light up, but that is essentially it. The battery storage on the mouse is super low, so you'll have to plug it in any way after about a half hour of use, maybe an hour if you turn off the rainbow LED light feature. The mouse's scroll wheel broke on me in a middle of a game, not any aggressive game, mind you, just a house decorating sim and I've hardly used it for the six or so months I've had it.To sum up: For a quick, cheap purchase, it looks great but isn't worth it in the long run, and I regret not buying a different mouse.",2022,07
"The mouse is cool, comfortable to use, but I’m not a fan of the sleep mode. It’s annoying, but I still like the mouse. Love the color shifting feature, too",2022,07
"After charging, it stopped working. So I put it back on the charger thinking it wasn’t fully charged and nope, still didn’t work! This was a waste of money.",2022,07
Once fully discharged I couldn’t get it to work again even after charging for multiple hours multiple times,2022,07
Super easy to use and transport. Works with my PC,2022,07
I love the wireless mouse. It hold charged in a month even though using 8 hours per day. It is quiet and work great. Thanks for good product. =),2022,07
Broke after 3 weeks of having it.,2022,07
"We purchased two of these and the scrollers broke on both of them in less than two months. There was no trauma to them, they're just junk.",2022,07
"It works, lasting charge but it is flimsy. Used for like 2 weeks no problem cool lighting but im not sure how will it will hold up",2022,07
Battery last about 3 hrs,2022,07
"Broke after no more than 10 minutes of use, something on the inside disconnected and the scrawling wheel spins freely…. not only it was a waste of money, I actually needed a compact mouse for my portable office. Forgot all about it in my trip, now it is too late to return it. You get what you pay for.",2022,07
LOVE this remote! The slim design fits perfectly in my hand. LOVE the changing rainbow colors and the ease of using is absolutely AWESOME!!! Would highly recommend this remote to ANYONE with a PC/Mac/laptop,2022,07
"I was really happy to use this mouse. it's light weight and I really liked the color changing light.However, had it a month and the wheel use to scroll up and down stopped working. So, basically it's useless.",2022,07
I liked the size and ease of charging but very dissatisfied with the lack of reliability.  And of course. Both stopped working just past the point I could return.  Waste of money - useless without the scrolling wheel.,2022,07
Yup.,2022,07
"Type C connector was bent, unable to use!  Is there a way to get a replacement Type C connector?",2022,07
"This mouse is very light, almost too light since you don’t place batteries inside. Ultimately that’s why I’m returning bc I need a mouse that I can’t pick up easily. Also the led lights  don’t look like the picture.",2022,07
I have this same model in Bluetooth and it works great. Needed it for an old yoga11 win10 laptop - no issues and works great,2022,06
Perfect budget mouse if your working with a MacBook like I am. Very smooth and responsive but I wouldn’t recommend for gaming because any crazy fast movement can kind of lag. But for my online studies it’s been perfect.very very long battery life I don’t think I’ve charged it since I bought it 🤣🤣,2022,07
Great mouse because you don't have to keep batteries on hand. It is rechargeable,2022,07
I loved this product until it stoped working after a month.,2022,07
Mouse would not charge after initial charge.  Only got one days use out of it,2022,07
I like it. Worth the money.,2022,07
"Good mouse, love the quiet clicks for working while kiddos are sleeping. Great price.",2022,07
This mouse stopped working after less than 6 months. Would not recommend,2022,07
"Easy to charge with USB cable, lasts longer",2022,07
Stops working even when it’s fully charged.,2022,07
It works well and easy to use,2022,07
Cheap quality and it broke quickly. save your money for something more durable,2022,07
"its sleek , the blush is cute color, like the colored lights also. works well",2022,07
Dissatisfied with purchase. Mouse works except for the scrolling wheel.,2022,07
Can’t change the color only stays on red,2022,07
The scroll wheel stopped working after 3 weeks.,2022,07
Would prefer to buy bcz its cheap and nice,2022,07
it works for what I need so no compliants  here.,2022,07
Computer,2022,07
"Spacious, still have room for other items",2022,07
I purchased this wireless mouse the first part of May 2022.  It is now early July 2022 and it doesn't work anymore!!  I have charged it and it still doesn't work.  WASTE OF MONEY!!,2022,07
Love it,2022,07
Stopped working after a few months and I haven’t used it that often for it to not work,2022,07
I like everything about this product,2022,07
Have no problems works just fine!!,2022,07
"Easy to use, enjoy how it feels, very smooth, soft click. Holds a charge for a long time. Lights are cool. It definitely made my life easier while working",2022,07
easy to use and charge. works with my chrome book w/o any special effort.  plugged it in it  works,2022,07
I love this mouse. Sleek design and quiet clicks make it perfect! Will probably buy another one!,2022,07
loved it at first sight lol,2022,07
Works great! Charges up after about an hour for a couple days use!! Great mouse!!,2022,07
"Thin design makes it easy to use and stylish. No bother with batteries, just plug in and charge",2022,07
"This mouse works perfectly for what I bought it for. It’s ergonomic, chic, colorful and works a long time before needing to be charged. It came quickly and was packaged nicely. Buy with confidence!",2022,07
Decent mouse… looks and feels cheap and the light show kinda adds to the “cheapness” of the mouse. Cursor tracking is the biggest issue. The cursor doesnt track consistently smooth when moving it around on the screen and the DTS button doesn’t seem to do anything for controlling this.,2022,07
Quiet and smooth,2022,07
" Finally sleep mode works on this upgraded LED mouse, sleep mode is a must for a mouse because not every time you’ll remember to turn it off plus why bother turning it off while your going for a short break or so it does it for you to save battery.Note: sleep mode does work on color mode, the previous mouse wouldn’t sleep on color mode but this upgraded mouse surly does and wish it had Bluetooth it would be the perfect mouse!",2022,07
"ive tried everything under the sun to make it work and alas it will not lol don’t buy it, not worth it",2022,07
"I removed the mouse from it's box, threw the box away and charged the mouse.  I started using it and on the second day, it just stopped working.  Because I couldn't return it in it's original box, I just threw it away.",2022,07
" I bought this mouse as a backup to keep in my laptop bag, and foolishly didn’t try to use it until the return window had already passed.It has never worked. I threw away my money.I’ve tried syncing this mouse to multiple computers and devices, with the same results — nothing. I can’t find any info about the switch on the bottom, or how to troubleshoot, but when I plug the mouse in to charge it, it illuminates blue. When I actually try to use it, it blinks red and shuts off.It has never worked. Please don’t waste your money. Please learn from my mistake.",2022,07
Maintains the charge for a long period. I don't miss batteries. Nice size and easy use.,2022,07
I use this for my second computer and it broke tonight.  Maybe used it a total of 20 times and all of a sudden it broke.  Of course it's out of the return window.  Don't waste your money.,2022,07
"Sleek, lightweight",2022,06
Nothing,2022,06
"The good - has a separate USB dongle that stores away, and charges internally, ie, no need for a battery.The bad - The mouse tracking is very erratic - too fast, too slow, and could not find a setting that suited me. But what renders it unusable for me is the click latency - I have to click multiple times on anything to get it to work, or I end up dragging something I don't mean to. Some people may also find this mouse a bit too small.YMMV - Up to one's taste how they like the changing colors on the mouse light display - either just red, or it switches colors. I wish you could turn it off though, which unfortunately you can't.",2022,07
I like the size and the fact I don't have to change betteries,2022,07
This mouse has been the best one that I have ever used.  I would purchase this again.  The fun part of the multi colors is another reason to purchase it again,2022,07
Stopped working 2nd north of work,2022,07
Fits my hand perfectly.,2022,07
I have a MacBook and it would not connect. I have charged the mouse for hours and still will not connect.,2022,07
Very nice. Responsive,2022,07
This is a nice streamlined mouse. It is responsive and rolls smoothly,2022,07
Functions exactly as described. Love it!,2022,07
I like the size and how easy it is to use,2022,07
Just a great item,2022,07
Works wonderful,2022,07
Good product,2022,07
Love that its rechargable and the led lights.,2022,07
Mouse works good,2022,07
"This mouse doesn't work well at all, I've had it about 2 months and the mouse doesn't respond, it drags and is not worth the money I paid for it...",2022,07
"I bought 4 of this product for myself and my family. All 4 stopped scrolling, just like that. When my first one went bad, I borrowed my daughter's and that stopped scrolling. So did the other 2 and we only had them for a little over a month when they stopped working. There appears to be a major defect in this product.",2022,07
"I love this mouse. The slim designer, color and quick/easy to charge",2022,07
It's very slow at connecting that one clicks on. Sometimes you have to tap a few times to get it to connect.,2022,07
Roller will not work. The mouse won’t scroll. Seems to be very common. It never worked.,2022,07
"Unfortunately I was in a hurry when I bought this and didn’t take the time to read the other reviews. Hopefully, you’re taking the time to read them. I got it and it never even turned on. I made sure I was doing everything right and even got my dad to look too, but it wouldn’t charge. The light would turn on when I plugged it in for a few minutes and then turn off. It looks like other people had this issue but a few weeks into using it, so at least it broke in time for me to return. Still a hassle",2022,07
it's a nice mouse,2022,07
"Lights up for a minute while plugged in to charge and then shuts off, won’t turn on at all and the USB C adapter it comes with doesn’t even fit into a C port / my MacBook A2179",2022,07
"Works like a charm. You can change the mouse speed right from the actual device, love it!",2022,07
Quite and really easy to use.,2022,07
It is a great compact size. Nice features. Feels good in the hand. I like that it is rechargeable.,2022,07
I love it when I first got it. But now it has stopped working.,2022,06
"This mouse was OK when I first got it.  I have a USB C-port in my tablet and ordered a mouse for a C-port.  What I received was a mouse for a USB A port + an adapter.  Not a great solution as it sticks out from the tablet and tends to get hit by other objects plus an additional point of failure.  The mouse worked well for about 2 weeks and then died.  It would take a charge and show fully charged but then when turned on to either of the 2 on positions, the mouse would light up for 1-3 seconds and then die.  I discarded this mouse and used another one I had around.",2022,06
"This mouse is not what i am use to . the arrow moves very quickly, and jerks .",2022,06
The price of the mouse vs the functionality is amazing.  My son is really happy with it.,2022,06
What I love most about the mouse that it’s quiet with you click.,2022,06
"Pretty much right After the return deadline, the thing just stopped working...broke...not worth the  money..should've sent it back to get my money back anyway!",2022,06
It didn't work at all. I already had a mouse but the scroll function doesn't work properly so I thought I'd get a new one. WRONG! It barely turned on and I charged it fully.,2022,06
Its okay takes a bit to get use too.  But it was only being used a few hours for 1 day & it just stopped working. I see it has usb ports but no cord. A waste of money,2022,06
Very easy to use  Good quality,2022,06
"I got this mouse for my daughter. It worked for the first few days, then quit charging. I’ve tried to charge with various cables and connectors, but no success. Total waste of money, I would not recommend this product.",2022,06
Have to bang mouse to get it to wake up.,2022,06
"Works as expected. I like the colors, they puts a little sunshine in my work day.Sleep mode is too quick for me but it wakes up quickly after a good shake.",2022,06
Love the product. Will probably order another color.,2022,06
It works very well with my MacBook,2022,06
Works very well,2022,06
I love that I can charge it and not have to keep going through batteries. Its better than the last mouse I had. Will upgrade my keyboard when it goes out.,2022,06
Was enjoying the use of the mouse until one day the usb stopped being recognized.,2022,06
the type C-receiver doesn't work. DO NOY BUY !,2022,06
"I got the mouse, but the charging cable sent was a type ""C"" charging cable so it wont fit into the mouse to charge.",2022,06
"I bought this mouse so I could have something rather than a trackpad for college. I read the manual and did everything to get this mouse to work. The softwares that are compatible with this mouse are older. I have the macOS 12.4, this mouse is only compatible with the macOS 10.12-10.12!! If you're looking for a mouse and you're in the same situation as me, this one isn't it!",2022,06
"Love this mouse. It works great, has a fun LED light feature, feels good in the hand, and is easy to use.",2022,06
"I bought one of these last year for one of my laptops and I loved it. So when the other mouses, mice, meeces, whatever went I bought 2 more. They are quiet and very easy to use. This time I forgot that the one USB connector was on the bottom so I was ready to send back and exchange it but when I went to pack it up I saw it on the bottom. Thank goodness because I really like them.",2022,06
This mouse is of good quality I am very satisfied,2022,06
You have to have a input for a USB for his mouse to work. It does not connect to tablets.,2022,06
I purchased this mouse 6 weeks ago. I only get on my laptop literally a few hours per week. Suddenly the scroll stopped working. I uninstalled and reinstalled the mouse. There were no driver updates. I changed the number of lines for scrolling. Nothing fixed the issue. Nice little mouse but rather useless if you’re unable to scroll. Naturally the return window expired about two weeks ago. I’d recommend buying another product of quality,2022,06
"Had no problem with hooking it up, the colors are beautiful and vibrant, very nice and convenient when traveling.",2022,06
I received the mouse and it worked great for 24 hours but now will not turn on or function at all. Have tried charging it multiple times with no success. Very disappointed.,2022,06
Close by lacking a quick response while using it. It works but something gf elt off.,2022,06
"Mouse comes with a converted bracket to convert your USB C slot to a regular USB slot so you can use it, but the parts stick way out and are ungainly.",2022,06
Does not recharge never did light up as advertised,2022,06
As expected,2022,06
"This mouse worked well for about 4 months. Then, it stopped holding a charge.  Even tethered to the laptop, it was not working well.  But why buy a wireless mouse if it needs to be used wired. And why use a wired mouse if it doesn't even work. Don't waste your money. I'll go pull out my ancient wired mouse that works.",2022,06
Scroll wheel broke 2 weeks into having it and stopped working not even 6 months later.,2022,06
"This mouse really only worked for about two months. Now, it seems to need to be charged more frequently/takes a long time to charge and does not move smoothly. It sort of sticks to the point that it is very annoying to use.",2022,06
"Worked amazing just as advertised, but after a month, it has not been working anymore. It's not charging, little blue light appears and then it dies when it's charging. Thus, the cursor works for a few mins and then dies. It's really not charging anymore, i'm so disappointed.",2022,06
"Worked perfectly.  Was concerned it wouldn’t work with my new Samsung Galaxy Probook 360, but the little piece for the C drive worked great as soon as I attached the USB provided.  If you’re worried it won’t be compatible, don’t be!  It worked!",2022,06
I’ve had this mouse for about two months or less. It does not work. Will charge but only hold a bit of power for about 20 minutes and die🙁,2022,06
I honestly don’t dislike anything. It holds a charge for a couple of weeks and I also love that it’s slim. I also love how it changes colors. Nice little gadget. I highly recommend.,2022,06
"This mouse worked ok for a couple of months then, it just won't work anymore. I tried charging it and it just doesn't do it. Waste of Money.",2022,06
This is the best computer mouse I have ever bought. I like that you just recharge it.,2022,06
Much better than previous mouse devices I've used!,2022,06
I use this mouse all day every day at my desk job and have had to charge maybe once a week (It never dies on me I just take it upon myself) I keep it on the regular mouse mode as I don’t need all of the colors flashing but I have no complaints,2022,06
"I purchased this mouse for my Thinkpad running linux and it worked like a charm. Set-up was a breeze, I simply plugged it in and it worked. It even works when I'm in the settings. This mouse is hard to beat for the price.",2022,06
"The mouse has a nice, small design, and I like how it feels when you click, but unfortunately the hardware is not high quality. The charging port has stopped working.",2022,06
"I purchased 2 mouse and both became defective after 1 month.  I reached out to the seller and advised me the mouse has a 1 year warranty and will send me 2 replacements. Up till this day, no replacements were recieved and the seller stopped responding to me. ***WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE***",2022,06
"The low profile of the mouse can cause wrist and hand fatigue, and unwanted inadvertent right clicks. Quiet as a mouse, literally. Subdued clicks. Nice led lighting, and rechargeable. Pretty good deal for the average low price.",2022,06
Meets my needs and I really enjoy it goes into sleep mode when not in use.,2022,06
Cheaply made.  USB C port is so poorly made it does not fit in port which makes the mouse worthless for use with my Surface. Mouse does not feel comfortable in hand. Just pass on this one.,2022,06
Long battery life due to sleep mode. Was impressed until scroll wheel stopped working.  Would have otherwise recommended highly,2022,06
The only problem I had with this item is that it doesn’t charge.,2022,06
I love the colors of the LED lights and the sleek size of the mouse itself but you can’t use the feature of wireless because it won’t hold a single charge. I’ve had it charged for 2 days now and it won’t work unplugged.,2022,06
I needed a small mouse for travel. It's working well. It has dpi settings which I haven't explored yet. I'm not crazy about it being rechargeable. I prefer batteries. But the rechargeable battery likely makes it lighter and smaller.,2022,06
"It’s been just over a month and it already broke, so disappointing because i did enjoy using it",2022,06
Just stopped working after seven months.,2022,06
I charged this brand new mouse and used it only for two weeks.; after the second week it stopped functioning. What a garbage!!!,2022,06
"Love th wmouse, but my wheel to scroll broke, so be careful",2022,06
It turns on but the left button does not work,2022,06
Loved at first but I've only used a handful of times and the middle rolling part broke so I can't scroll.,2022,06
I do presentations for work and I can plug my lap top into the television and use the mouse to advance slides…,2022,06
It works well with my laptop for everyday work.Has glitched occasionally when I’ve got the laptop docked with multiple monitors for gaming which is frustrating.For work - highly recommendFor gaming-  NOT recommended,2022,06
The mouse was perfect for travel then my wheel just stopped working 2 months ago.  The mouse is not even a year old.,2022,06
"Works well, plug and play, easy to charge, kids love the color and lights.",2022,06
the light display makes u enjoy it and it fits well,2022,06
If you're looking for an inexpensive basic mouse this one is great. The colors add an extra fun flair.,2022,06
just waited long enough so that the return policy wore out !!!! fantastic. regardless of that the mouse is smooth to hold and i enjoyed using it for the little time i got to use it. make sure to test the charging port if you buy it,2022,06
Don’t buy! Cheap crap,2022,06
I bought one and it broke 1st week.  The second one doesn't work properly,2022,06
10/10 it looks great and is easy to use,2022,06
the clicker won’t work any more because the rolling piece broke,2022,06
"Just received this yesterday and plugged it in today. I have left it on the charger for longer than 2 hours because every time it says it is charged, I can not use it longer than 5 min before it goes dead. Like the look and feel of it but I did not buy it to used plugged in. Very disappointed and will have to buy something different. The box got thrown away so I guess it can not be returned at this point. Will give it one more day to try before choosing something different. I'd like to hope that I just got a lemon.",2022,06
Stopped holding a charge after only one week,2022,06
"I was so excited to receive this mouse. I chose it because the color with so nice ( I bought it in mint green) and the features of the multicolor led lights. However, to my surprise this mouse doesn’t hold charge. After maybe two hours of use it’s done and needs to be charged for a few hours In order to be used again. Naturally I went back to my original Apple mouse.",2022,06
Worked for about a week.,2022,06
Like that when not in use,2022,06
"I like the fact that it lights not only can you see it in the dark, but it alerts you when the batteries or low",2022,06
"The perfect cute little mouse!Update: I had this mouse for a little less than a month, which was so perfect and then stopped working. Definitely wasted my money.",2022,06
Scroll wheel on/off switch broke without much use. It was good while it lasted but nothing too special. Mainly liked the shape,2022,06
The mouse worked great in the initial few weeks but then started having lag in movement and slowly it became so slow in movement that the click also stopped working 70% of the time. Disappointed as I bought this item after reading numerous positive reviews :(,2022,06
It broke in a week,2022,06
"OK I’d like to recommend that you really think about buying a mouse that requires charging via USB cable. Because when this puppy goes dead, you can’t work until you charge it.  I work from home, so I use my mouse from 8 AM until about 6 PM nonstop. I have to charge every day, otherwise I’m dead in about two days tops.So I do like the mouse, But unlike just popping in some new batteries and you’re good to go, you have to remember to CHARGE it!!  LOL!!",2022,06
I like everything,2022,06
Worked well with my laptop until it stopped working 6 months later,2022,06
Very ergonomic. Soft click. Like that it recharges and doesn't need batteries. I can plug it in overnight if I need to. But the charge lasts a long time. It is comfy,2022,06
"For the price, good product. Have not used it much yet, but will suit the purpose for small portable mouse.",2022,06
"Mouse is fine, but my usb c adapter was junk from the start. Be aware if you’re planning on using it in one of these ports.",2022,06
I have a mac book and I have been charging the mouse for 5 hours and it wouldn't connect. I have tried everything and looked up how to set up the mouse. But it didn't work.,2022,06
"I am enjoying my colorful mouse however, my mouse connected to the computer of someone else while in use during class. I have also been having trouble connecting to my personal computer when I am by myself.",2022,06
"I loved this mouse - it was so pretty and the glided really smoothly. Everything worked great for about a month and now the mouse won't turn on. I've charged it fully and whenever I attempt to turn the switch ""on"", it shuts right back off.That being said, I did buy another one. Being under $15, I don't mind having to replace it. Hopefully, it was a fluke with the first mouse and this second one will work for much longer than a few weeks. If the same thing happens again, I will not be purchasing a third.",2022,06
Great mouse overall. But the middle click button needs a lot of pressure to click which is quite annoy. Other than that I would have given it a 5 star.,2022,06
" Loved this mouse, but after a couple of months it started making a weird noise while scrolling. - 3 points for that",2022,06
Lasts long on initial charge. Perfect size!,2022,06
I don't use this everyday. Maybe twice a week.i love how quiet it is. But the scroll button stopped working. It now just continually spins... 😒,2022,06
I just use it as a regular mouse.,2022,06
Product didn’t work. Hard to right click,2022,06
" I decided to buy a mouse for my laptop for college. I really don't like laptop mouse pads. I prefer the click mouse. This one scrolls, right/left clicks, and moves smoothly. I do use it on a mouse pad which helps it move smoothly. It works on hard surfaces like my desk but not as smooth. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a mouse. Makes my online college classes easier. I've been using this for a out 2 months now and I e only charged it twice. Has a long battery life and sleep mode. To exit sleep mode just click the mouse once. Can't say I've seen any glitches that people are talking about. Maybe there's were defective. Mine works great. Thank you",2022,06
"This thing worked great the first time I used it, then wouldn't work at all. Won't charge, won't move the cursor. Total crap.",2022,06
Nice mouse worked great for my needs. Glides smooth holds charge well.,2022,06
"Was great until it fell less than a foot, onto carpet, and broke, the day after my return window. Will not recommend this to anyone due to how apparently fragile it is. Now I’m left with a broken mouse and disappointment.",2022,06
When I opened the box containing the product a bunch of white powder feel out. Not sure what it is but it's very unsettling. I checked for a silica packet or something it could have come from but found nothing. I washed really well but my hands are itching now might be an allergic reaction.,2022,06
I bought this mouse and use it for the first time yesterday and I charged it last night and now the mouse will not turn on. A definite waste of money!,2022,06
USB part broke inside of computer. Hardly used.,2022,06
"I bought this mouse for work, it was great at first. It’s supposedly rechargeable, I was able to charge it once fine. It died again days later, and now won’t charge or turn on. I’ve tried different cords, blocks, and outlets so I’m confident the problem is the mouse. This is useless.",2022,06
"Very beautiful and easy to use, but came apart after few months of using",2022,06
"Easy to navigate, lights add a touch of fun. I use this as my traveling mouse with my lightweight laptop. No complaints and no problems",2022,06
"It doesn’t come with the charger cord it claims to have .. just opened the box .. let’s see how it operates , once I find a charger cord for it 🤦‍♀️ Won’t waste my money here again",2022,06
I DROP IT ONCE... and it just completely breaks,2022,06
Less 2.5 months old. Worked great at first and now it won't charge. It's crap,2022,06
Really like the mouse until 2 months in it started having issues. Just trying to move the cursor across the screen became a struggle.,2022,06
"At first I was a little bit worried about the quality of this product, but let me tell you this worked out perfectly.",2022,06
"Review after 2 months use:I liked the mouse a lot , it was rechargeable, cool with lights. But it suddenly stopped working after 2 months. Very disappointed.",2022,06
The mouse is cute and light but it doesn't consistently work throughout the day. It will be working and then all of a sudden it will be non-responsive and has to be turned off and back on to get it to work again. Would not recommend.,2022,06
"Cute, light weight very easy to use. I love this mouse.",2022,06
iy works so what can one say about a mouse?,2022,06
Purchased as an alternative to a wired mouse along with having a spare to throw in my work bag in case of issues.  Ended up designating this mouse for use with my home security system and it’s working as expected.  No issues after the first charge.,2022,06
Have had this less than two months and it doesn’t work at all after hours of charging. Computer only recognizes clicks but no movement at all. Waste :/,2022,06
Stopped working after two months,2022,06
"Doesn't work at all. The two pieces barely even connect, let alone to the laptop.Waste of time and money.Cheaply made.",2022,06
Worked great until today. Scroll wheel no longer works. This is not even an item I use more than three times a month. Disappointing.,2022,06
"I only have 2 issues for this item.The charging cord fell apart 1 month after I received it.The mouse its self stopped working a few months after receiving it.  After reaching out to the manufacturer who promised to replace the item, which I never received, I am forced to buy another mouse but definitely not from this manufacturer.",2022,06
Love this mouse! So easy to use. Simple set up.,2022,06
"This is cute and slim and I love that I don't have to replace batteries, just charge it up when my computer is not in use. I use it for web browsing as well as basic gaming.",2022,06
"Absolutely terrible. The adapter doesn’t stay in the computer, the mouse doesn’t charge. Not a single good thing about it",2022,06
A dependable mouse for regular use not gaming. Thank you for a smooth transaction.,2022,06
Tiny Great for laptop Size.,2022,06
After a couple months my mouse died. Don’t buy this thing.,2022,06
I love the design and ease of use.  I’m older so I am used to using a mouse.  This works perfectly.,2022,06
"Didn't work very well from the very beginning. Then it was dropped in water, dried out, and was even worse. 😏",2022,06
Charge doesn’t last long at all! Feels cheap. Works for my 5 year old to use but nothing I would keep for myself.,2022,06
Very fragile when dropped.,2022,06
"The mouse is cute and work, but I do feel like there is some delay especially when Im working between 2 monitors. I've been using this mouse for a little over a month now and the right click just broke randomly so theres that.",2022,06
"Literally bought it today, it connected at first and upon turning it off after and turning it on it did not want to connect at all... I gave it a full charge and the battery only lasted up for 5min. Very disappointed",2022,06
"Scroll is not working properly after 6 months of usage, undoubtedly battery is very good though.",2022,06
"After using this product for only about 1 hour the wheel broke , so you can not use that feature. Very poor quality...Would not recommend this product.",2022,06
It's not the best. You get what you pay for.,2022,06
This mouse is the best!!  It's got a quiet click and has sleep mode as well.  I highly recommend!,2022,06
"I initially really enjoyed this mouse, it is a good size, the battery life is reasonable, and I'm a sucker for anything that lights up rainbow. I do wish that you could turn on just the mouse and not the lights without there being a constant red light.However! After using the mouse for less than 2 months, the scroll wheel stopped working and I can't figure out why. I've tried cleaning it out, recharging the battery, and adjusting my driver settings with no luck. I'm definitely frustrated and because my return window has past I'm not sure how to reach out to customer service. :(",2022,06
I was excited to get a mouse that was USB charge instead of batteries. Ive charged it once and it worked great for about a week which is awesome! But I have been trying to charge it now for 2 days and it will not accept a charge. Im past my return window and cannot get my money back or exchange it for a new one. This is a big bummer.....,2022,06
"Didn’t even work, sensitivity way to fast",2022,06
"Was a nice mouse while it lasted. It is not even 3 months old and not working, turns on but then nothing.",2022,06
"I JUST GOT THIS MOUSE AND DOESNT EVEN TURN ON AFTER CHARGING THE USB PLUG DOES NOT WORK AS WELL, THIS JUST ISNT A GOOD BUY IF I WAS YOU I WOULD GO FOR A DIFFERENT ONE CAUSE ITS A WASTE OF MONEY SO JUST SAVE IT AND LOOK FOR A DIFFERENT ONE",2022,06
If you can…spend the extra money and buy something a little better quality,2022,06
Worked for a couple months - doesn’t anymore,2022,06
"I've been through two of these mice. The first one lasted only one day before the scroll wheel stopped working. I opted for an exchange, but the new one had the same issue after about 3 weeks. Looking through reviews, it seems to be a common issue. Returning this for another brand.",2022,06
I love this mouse but I am so bummed it broke after 3 months!!! The roller ball completely stopped working but at least I could still use the mouse to navigate the screen.,2022,06
Scroll wheel completely stopped working after two months. The power cord also stopped charging the mouse after a few weeks of use. A complete waste of money.,2022,06
"Great design, fits great in your hand, easy to use... loved it for the month I've had it but... The scroll button just started spinning the last time I turned it on. That button no longer works, no scrolling for me. Left and Right still work and holds a great charge however I need to scroll and it is just past my return date 😔",2022,06
I was stunned by the quality of this great wireless mouse. With a charging port it never needs a battery since it is built-in. I've used the mouse for months and without recharging it goes and goes. A winner.,2022,06
IT WORKED FINE AND THEN STOP I BOUGHT TWO I HOPE THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T DIED TOO,2022,06
 Pros:-Quiet-Smooth-No delays or lagging issues so far-Pretty colors (when not moving the mouse)Cons:-Seems a bit cheap-A little flatter than I'd like; doesn't fit naturally to my palm so it makes it uncomfortable-The red optical light shines through the other pretty colors when you're moving the mouse.  I want to see the various colors (even when moving the mouse)---not a red LED light shining through which is overpowering.-Some of the colors shine all throughout and for much longer while others barely show.The right side of the mouse (I'm right-handed) doesn't emit the colors as vividly as the left side (next to my thumb).  One small section is almost inoperative.I'll probably be returning it as I have bought another mouse that also changes colors and it doesn't emit the red LED like this one.  It was super cheap fortunately in case I keep it.  Who knows!  I guess you get what you pay for.,2022,06
"I loved this mouse at first. However after just one one of using it, it just stopped working one day. Even after being charged the night before. Nothing seemed to bring it back to life. Very disappointed as I am outside of the return window BY ONE WEEK. Definitely do not recommend.",2022,06
Mouse was working fine for about a week now the middle button to scroll stop working,2022,06
I am big on reviews & peoples honest opinions when it counts. As for style it’s a nice mouse but for the main purpose of the mouse it is not good. Even if it’s completely charged it will only work for about 10/15 minutes before it starts to freeze & then eventually go dead. It’s very frustrating & annoying especially if you work from home. I would of posted a pic but I am in the process of returning it & don’t feel like getting it.,2022,06
"I love the rotating colors on the mouse but it doesn't run by batteries. This seems pretty cool at first because you save money on having to buy double a's but then you have to think about remembering to charge it. If you've been using it all day non stop, it starts to die by the night time. Other than that i think it's super cute. and it's pretty good and accurate with pointing even on shiny surfaces I didn't have much of an issue.",2022,06
I love the sleekness,2022,06
This worked great for 4 months. Then it just stopped working. It's fully charged but won't work. Tryed changing adapter and still doesn't work. Not an expensive mouse but not worth anything if it doesn't work.,2022,06
It stopped working,2022,06
they won't hold a charge,2022,06
It's works okay but my scrool wheel doesn't work and it never jad,2022,06
Love it as it’s multi functional,2022,06
"Got these for the kids Chromebook's, best thing yet.  Kids like the lights and they are easy for them to use.",2022,06
I just needed a wireless mouse for at work because I was sick of the cord the company issued mouse had.  The color is bright and the lights are a nice subtle change to working…they’re pretty.  The only thing I hate is that I have to bounce it on the mousepad to wake it up.  Nothing major but the sensor could be better.  It’s not overwhelmingly wonderful but it’s cute and is a good value considering the cost.,2022,06
So easy to hold. Just plug in the wireless receiver and turn on the power switch on the bottom of the mouse and start using. No batteries to install because the mouse is wireless.,2022,06
"I was using this mouse to play sims 4 on my mac book and it was working great for about a month and then yesterday all of a sudden it just flatlines. The only light that comes on is when i turn it on, I’ve tried to unplug, turn on, and turn off the mouse I even went as far as to reboot my computer. I swear to God of the seller emails me to take this down i’m gonna go off!! THIS ITEM IS TERRIBLE!!!! DO ❌NOT❌BUY❌",2022,06
"Its a good mouse and its different from your standard mouse, I like the fact it lights up.",2022,06
Battery lasted less than 2 minutes after charging for 2 hours. Connected to my laptop just fine.,2022,06
I bought one of these and in three months it completely stopped working. I couldn’t charge it or use it. I bought a second one thinking the first one was a bad one and the second one did the same thing. Buy something more reputable. I would not recommend buying this product.,2022,05
This mouse did not work from the get-go which is why I am certain I was not it's first owner. This mouse was missing the one part it needed to operate (a USB receiver) which is customarily located securely under the unit itself. The mouse was halfway in a sleeve as if RE-stuffed back into it's original packaging. Returning this immediately,2022,05
"Worked for only a week. When I went to recharge it for the first time, the light went on for a minute and then just shut off. One use mouse.",2022,05
It works fine- just seems a little cheap and not real comfortable.,2022,05
Long lasting battery!!!,2022,05
This mouse came broken very upset it was delivered in time but the devise itself was broken the package was opened it wasn’t even inside the actual box it’s ridiculous definitely going to get my money back I gave it a star because I had no choice but too 😡👎🏾,2022,05
"I’m very comfortable ergonomically feel, internal rechargeable batteries, and instant connection while setting up for the first time. Took less than 10 seconds from taking it out of the box to working. The button press is also really smooth and doesn’t feel like a hard click. The roller knob at the top is fairly smooth and the transitional LED lighting looks really good. Very happy with this purchase",2022,05
"It was easy to connect and worked great then It worked for a while , was perfect then it job stopped working out of nowhere",2022,05
It states that it has a usbc converter but it does not work,2022,05
"I do like the mouse, but the usb-c connector does not go all the way in to my macbook, which is frustrating.",2022,05
I wanted to love this mouse. The first one randomly stopped working for no reason. It was past the return window so I bought another one hoping it was just a fluke or that I did something wrong even though I’m sure I didn’t. I bought a second one and that one too stopped working randomly after the return window closed. I won’t be buying this again,2022,05
"Recharges,  easy to use. I use it as my travel mouse. Would recommend it.",2022,05
Do not drop the mouse on the floor. Very sensitive and broke right away after having it for a year. So this is the second one I ordered. Works very well and has cute colors.,2022,05
"Had high hope for this cute product. Was very disappointed. For starters, the charging light did not work so I couldn't tell if it was charging at all. When I tried it the next day after charging it did work (only directly plugged into my mac, wouldn't work in my adaptor which is another issue) and it worked that day. The next day it would not work. Already annoyed as I wasn't looking to charge this all day to work for only work hours. I did turn it off after each use as well. The next day it worked for even less time. Maybe only a couple of hours. This mouse is cheap junk and I don't recommend it to anyone.",2022,05
"The mouse was decent for the price. However I'm now just about 2 weeks out of my return window, and the scroll stopped working on the mouse 2 days ago. Was hoping it was a random, temporary issue but it seems it's permanent. I'm disappointed that I can't at least return or exchange the item and now have to go and buy a new mouse..",2022,05
have had this item since March and now when I scroll down using the roller it squeaks and is very annoying,2022,05
"Really liked it at first, especially since it charges and doesn't need a battery. BUT... the courser jumps EVERYWHERE!!!! I have accidentally closed out my browser and all my tabs several times. Once during a meet with my boss where I was PRESENTING!!! Of course, now that I have definitely decided this mouse sucks and I want to return it, the window is closed. DON'T BUY THIS MOUSE!",2022,05
"I like that is a quiet mouse; however, one side of the mouse stopped working. I was going to see if can get an exchange and missed it by 4 days. broken in less than 1 month.",2022,05
It works,2022,05
works great,2022,05
Doesn’t hold good charge,2022,05
"The laser is broken, it jumps everywhere on the screen.",2022,05
"The mouse seems to work fine and looks nice, but arrived very dirty. The box being dirty I can understand due to shipping, but the mouse itself has lint, a few pieces of pet hair, and the track scroll is dirty as if it’s been used a lot. It was not described as used, but very much appears to be and I’m upset to pay full price for something that has definitely been out of the box.",2022,05
I bought this mouse for my Macbook and it would not even turn on! I charged it all day and it would not work or connect to my laptop. It just flashed a red color like the battery was dead and that was that happened. Save yourself some money and look for another mouse elsewhere. I should've just gone to best buy or target.,2022,05
Worked beautifully for a month and then the roller ball broke. I guess you get what you pay for.,2022,05
Does not last x,2022,05
I admit that I might have overused it since I bought it for my work from home.. BUT my sis got a similar one which is why I bought this one and THAT one actually lasts days without the need of a chargeI needed to charge this one multiple times on the day and at one point it just wouldn't work even while plugged in so I still needed to switch to the old oneIt is really disappointing idk if a got a faulty product or if that is actually the extent of its productivity,2022,05
Ergonomic for gaming,2022,05
The first few weeks it worked great then all of a sudden the scroll stopped working and it just spins.I have to physically grab the side of the page to move down. Really disappointed ☹️,2022,05
Stopped working after a couple months.,2022,05
3 months later and it does not work.,2022,05
"I haven't used this product for at least a day and it is already not working!!!! It doesn't track properly to my computer, this is the worst mouse save your money and don't buy this",2022,05
I purchased gold they sent black. Tried to send it back but Amazon couldn’t afford gas so the place I needed to return it to was inconvenient so I kept it. Big mistake. I got it at end of April  and the scroll portion is already broken. A sham of mouse and company.,2022,05
I have purchased two of this product in the past year (one to replace the other). On both of the the scroll button stopped working. I dropped the first one and I understood why it stopped working. The second one I did not drop. It just quit working after 3 months. Cute and light weight but not long lasting enough for me.,2022,05
Function well at work still.,2022,05
Horrible quality. The wheel stopped working only after a few hours. It is very light and feels very cheap.,2022,05
"My first concern is that it does not give you a warning when it needs recharging, it just dies out, If you are using your USB for something else, you have to stop what you are doing to plug in the mouse.  Second, the charge does not last long. Very frustrating.  And now the most important - It Died!  Just stopped working.  Oh well, so much for fancy; I'm going back to battery operated mouse.",2022,05
"The title of my post says a lot. I also like how lightweight it is. It’s very responsive to movement, but not overly so. It’s as good a wireless mouse as I’ve ever had.",2022,05
"The mouse itself was wonderful! It installed within seconds and was very smooth operating. It fit well in my small hand and there was no clicking noise. I wish it worked out as I liked the mouse itself.The only issue is not the mouse itself, but my sensitivity to the LED/optical lights. I got a  migraine from it. The LED light can be turned off, so that in itself could be remedied. But the optical light which is a bright red showed through the side lights, the gap between the switches and the DPI option switch. There was no way of blocking the light. I was really sad I had to return it.",2022,05
"Works as expected, love this mouse!",2022,05
"I work from home and I work 8-12 hours a day depending if I do overtime or not so I needed a mouse because my wireless mouse of 5 years was dying. Now, I got this mouse in hopes it would work great because of all the reviews. The first day I got this mouse it was very uncomfortable so right off the bat I knew I didn’t like flat mouses because it was cramping my hand. Second, the cursor was glitching. Unfortunately I cannot attach a video because it would be on company property and I don’t have a personal computer. I’ll have it on one side of the screen and automatically it will go to the other. If you like mouses like this and can deal with the glitching then that’s fine but for me I hated it. Very frustrating.",2022,05
"Good size and shape, but unfortunately the scrolling wheel broke un the first month.",2022,05
"Started off great, but the charge stopped working, couldn’t tell if it needing charging, one day it didn’t turn on, left it to charge while it was off and on 2 hours each way and it still wouldn’t hold a charge or turn on. Battery ended up exploding and started leaking acid. Overall horrible product",2022,05
"It worked for the first hour I bought it. I went to charge it. It no longer works, turns on, or charges.",2022,05
Works as a mouse should work.,2022,05
In the second week it stoped to work and the item is very light I wouldn’t never buy it again or from this seller,2022,05
Real good and the charge last a lot.,2022,05
It is so nice to use it with my laptop,2022,05
"The mouse seemed nice when I got it and has a great feel in your hand with quiet clicks. However, after 3 weeks of every other day use the scroll wheel stopped working. I returned it for a replacement and now, 3-4 weeks after receiving the replacement, that scroll wheel has also stopped working. Because the original purchase was outside the return window, a return was not possible. Would not buy again, and am going with a different product from a different seller/manufacturer.",2022,05
The scroll wheel broke,2022,05
The Best! Ergonomic and lightweight. Feels comfortable after hours of use at my laptop. Fits perfectly in the pocket of a laptop bag. Not bulky like others I've tried. Stays charged for a long time. I love the color.,2022,05
It's slim not bulky works well with my laptop love the lights great buy,2022,05
you dont hear any clicking like normal mouses which is nice. The color is good and smooth as well. My only complaint is you have to move it back and forth sometimes to wake it up. Rather than that its a perfect mouse when its awake.,2022,05
"It seems to work fine so far.  The lights around the side are constantly red until well charged, but then they rotate.  Very easy to set up, but does not seem to work when wired.",2022,05
"Mouse worked great! was easy to connect and use. But stopped working and had to throw it away after 3-4 months of use. stopped charging, stopped working all together.",2022,05
looks so cheap. didn't even work properly.,2022,05
This mouse stops working even when fully charged and the light on the bottom is on. This did not start happening until 6 weeks after the return window ended. I would not recommend buying this for these reasons. It was a waste of money.,2022,05
I love the colors.,2022,05
"Purchased December 3 2021 quit working May 5, 2022. Will not hold a charge and will not turn on.",2022,05
"You get what you pay for, I guess. They were great at first. But then one of them, the USB port bent and broke and took the jaws of life to pull out of our USB port; the second one, the top of the mouse fell off.",2022,05
"its not wireless, i use the mouse for my hp elitebook and the only way i can use it if i have the charger connected",2022,05
Excelente,2022,05
Very loud with every click !!!!!!,2022,05
The mouse arrived today. Easy to set up. So far it is working properly. I like the fact that it's rechargeable. No more AA battery to replace. I'll have to get use to its size. A lot shorter than my old Morosoft mouse. Hope it lasts as long as the old mouse. Time will tell.,2022,05
work~ very slow,2022,05
Scroller is squeaky and makes noise. Seems loose,2022,05
Poor quality. Difficult to replace battery,2022,05
"I really liked the mouse at first, it matched perfectly and was very convenient. First thing i noticed was how plasticy it was, that didn't bother me tho. One day as i was using the mouse to scroll, the little scroll wheel fell into the mouse! i tried to fix it and i couldn't. I wasn't pressing hard on it and it always stayed on my desk. Its a cute mouse, love the look of it. But it is very cheaply made and will most likely break!",2022,05
"Not sure why this died after a couple months of use, but it is no longer working. Bummer because it was super cute and added to my office aesthetic.",2022,05
"Worked great initially. It was cute and charged easily and quickly. Now, after 8 months, it glitches and does not glide smoothly and will not hold a charge. Would not recommend.",2022,05
It’s a cool looking mouse but only lasted 3 months until it stopped working.,2022,05
It was good for the three days before it diedBad product or quality control. At least. it was not expensive!,2022,05
"Honestly it’s far less heavy than I would’ve liked. I don’t feel as though this will be adequate for long-term gaming but it’ll be alright for web surfing or writing. It’s also fairly small, then again I have pretty large hands. For the price, I couldn’t ask for much more, but I do think it’s important to inform people of its cons regardless of how cheap it is. Also, it DOES work with a macbook air despite the one star reviews. You have to connect the receiver to the adapter (it takes a good bit of force) and then plug it into the computer. I wish the instructions could’ve been more clear about that, but it’s whatever:",2022,05
This mouse is just trash. It’s lifespan is 32 days. Stopped working just 2 days after the return window closed. I don’t recommend purchasing if you want something that is actually functional and long lasting. Getting tired of Amazon allowing vendors sell junk without recourse.,2022,05
Didn’t realize that there wasn’t a place to put a battery in so it always had to be charged. After two or three weeks I could no longer charge it and could not have it work. Cheaply made would not recommend if you need it long-term or if you spend a lot of time on the computer,2022,05
"While working with MacBook Pro, frequently mouse is getting disconnected. I need to take the dongle out and then attach for reconnection. Wouldn't recommend if you are using type c port.",2022,05
Worked for 2 minutes the first time I turned on the mouse and then it just completely stopped working with my MacBook. Charged it for days and still does not work.,2022,05
I liked this mouse just fine.  I bought it to use at school with my chromebook.  It was fine until a couple weeks ago. I scrolled the mouse wheel and something broke. Now the wheel just spins and spins and does nothing.  I only used it a few times a week for meetings and such. I would buy a better one; don't bother with this one.,2022,05
This mouse is great quality and duration is excellent. This mouse goes uncharged for 2 months while being a university student. I realize recently it have been giving a little problem. Hopefully the seller can assist with this. Great but otherwise,2022,05
I loved the product!!!,2022,05
Great product,2022,05
Mouse battery doesn’t charge,2022,05
"Pretty but the quality is very poor. It is rechargeable, which was a selling point but the quality isn't there.",2022,05
I use this mouse for my laptop.  I love that it’s super smooth and very quick.,2022,05
Very comfortable and feels great,2022,05
"Charged up quickly in a little over an hour.  Looks great, feels great, but the scrolling wheel does not work.  Looking at it closely, it looks like the wheel is slightly off center.  It spins freely, like it isn't connected to anything.  Back it goes.",2022,05
" Absolutely love it! And it is rechargeable, changes colors. The battery lasts forever.  5 stars",2022,05
The mouse itself is nice but the USBc part does not fit into my surface nor does the USB part fit.  I bought this because i have a new surface and needed a USBc to USB connection so i could use the mouse with the surface.  I guess the specs are different in China.i had to go back and buy a USBc so i could use the mouse.  Attached is a picture of the one i had to buy.Do not recommend unless you want a project.,2022,05
"The tracking ball/wheel stopped working after a couple of months. Thinking I broke the tracking wheel, I ordered a new one and it arrived with the same issue straight out of the box. It works fine if you don't mind not having the tracking wheel.",2022,05
The scroller doesn’t work. Mouse feels generic,2022,05
Light and the clicks are very quiet. It's durable. I especially like the fact it light up and change colors,2022,05
love this mouse. its lightweight and i love that its USB charge. A great value for the price.,2022,03
"Just so you know, I loved the simple Amazon wireless mouse, but our cats kept knocking it off the table and the battery cover would come off. Over and over (stupid cats!) But now, with this mouse, the battery is rechargeable, the cats can't tear it apart, and it has cool lights on it. The function is good, the price was low, everything is solid--so, I recommend it.",2022,05
I’ve only had this for a few months now and it is completely broken. The scroll feature lost its traction and no longer works. The battery life wasn’t great and it never worked flawlessly. I need a new mouse now 🥺,2022,05
I don’t like that I need to replug it in my laptop to get it to work every time I use it,2022,05
i like,2022,05
This is a clean simple design.  Completely simple to install.,2022,05
Perfect mouse,2022,05
Horrible. Just horrible,2022,05
"Great mouse, nothing super fancy.  Comfortable to use.  The lights are pretty cool but there is an option to not have them on which is great to extend battery life. Holds a charge really well and will still work with the usb charger plugged in if necessary. I plugged in to 2 different computers and worked immediately on both. Seems quite reaponsive, but I only use it for general computer work so i dont know how it would work for gaming. All in all great mouse for a decent price.Will update if anything changes",2022,05
"This mouse is so cute, the chip is a little challenging to get out but works amazing and the colors are adorable",2022,05
"Mouse is fine, but needs frequent charging",2022,05
Perfect,2022,05
"I have not had this mouse for a little over 10 days. I love the feel of the mouse and how sleek it is HOWEVER no matter how much I charge the mouse, it stops responding after about 5 minutes of use. I have found myself removing the dongle from my laptop several times a day just to make the mouse respond. I bought the mouse to improve my work functionality to no avail.",2022,05
This item only worked for Less than 30 days it was going well and then stopped holding a charge,2022,05
I got this mouse April12th and it just stopped working May 19th so i cannot return it. I loved this mouse but sad it stopped working,2022,05
"Just got the item today, everything works out great but the usb could not fit into the adapter, neither could any other usb's. As seen in the picture they all try to go in sideways and thats why they wont fit. So, even though the product works just fine, I am unable to use it which is why its a three star. Regardless, if you have normal usb ports, this product will work just fine!",2022,05
"Works well, very responsive",2022,05
"It worked good at first but it will not respond anymore, even after being fully charged. Waste of money. It’s cute though. Good thing it stopped working right away so I can still return it 😒",2022,05
This product does not work with my Macbook Air A2337 it worked last night when I first opened the box and it already won't keep a charge or charge at all. Buyer beware.,2022,05
"Worked great, very pretty (aquamarine color), easy you use, precise and then suddenly died today. Stop charging, so after a few months it departed this world without a sound. Not worth it. Wish it did. I'm going to order from another maker.",2022,05
Complete junk. Never worked. Don’t waste your money because it’s pretty,2022,05
Got this to try to alleviate hand pain from using a traditional mouse. Helped enough shape wise but the battery is so short that it doesn’t last a day. I was using for work so that is a problem.,2022,05
"The mouse came as described with the option I chose. However, after letting it charge for the recommended time before use, it would not connect to my computer. Turned it off and then back on and it worked for about 30 minutes. Within that 30 minutes, only showed one color the whole time. It never worked again afterwards. Just went and bought a $10 mouse from walmart and it works like perfect, even more sturdier than this one. Don’t waste your money on this.",2022,05
Don’t waste your money on this. Mine stop working within the first month of having it.,2022,05
Dies way too quickly. The product itself is so light and feels cheaply constructed; I wish I could have returned it.,2022,05
"Have to charge it twice a day at least.It is not comfortable, too small to fit nicely in my hand.The flow is choppy, the cursor sticks.It feels cheap, like it is going to break at any second.",2022,05
"don't waste your time, horrible quality and does not work with macbook air",2022,05
"After only a 3 months.....MY MOUSE NO LONGER WORKS. I am so upset because I LOVEDDDDD THIS MOUSE. It's slim and fits in my laptop bag easily and everything. It checked off everything on my list, but no matter how long I charge it now, it will flash and stop working. I'm so sad, and now the return window has passed and now I can't even return it.:(",2022,05
The mouse is very good and I love the colors but it seems to go into sleep mode way too often??  Unfortunately my mouse stopped working after a few weeks after purchase??,2022,05
Stopped working after 3 months. Trash,2022,05
"Mouse was advertised as quiet, but it is far from quiet. It has the loudest sound I have ever heard from a mouse when clicking the middle button.  Disappointed in the clearly false advertising.",2022,05
"Fits my hand perfectly, the color changing lights are a fun addition to every day boring mundane task! The black mouse is sleek and soft! I LOVE IT",2022,04
"I was so excited, this mouse looks beautiful! But... it was one of the most frustrating devices I have ever used. When clicking to wake it up it would click on whatever may be on the screen at the moment, including email or IM drafts that have not yet been reviewed or perhaps written in anger and did not mean to send lol.When you wanted to click on something, you had to click several times. Overall frustrating. Very good return process, no questions asked and quick refund. That's why 2 stars.",2022,05
Sensor is all whacked out.  Stopped working at 34 days so I’m out the money and have to purchase a new mouse.  Don’t do it,2022,05
 I loveddddddd my mouse super excited 😆 but I’m used to clicking the scrolling piece to create the auto scroll well I did it and now my scrolling piece is broken 😞 .. sooooo don’t push the scrolling piece ! But overall I love it and it instantly connected to my MacBook Pro and everything was working great !,2022,05
It stopped working only after 2 months.,2022,05
"Its pretty, but the charge doesn't last long. I plug it in to my laptop to charge, but the laptop shuts down after a few minutes and the mouse quits charging. There is a short charging cord but no adaptor to plug it into the wall. And it says not to use cell phone charging adaptors.. So recharging was a pain.",2022,05
The scroll broke within 2 hours of taking out of package. Can still use it to open tabs but can't scroll.,2022,05
"Terrible product. Does not work well. Glitches, causes cursor to makes sudden unintended changes in direction without in use. Would not recommend",2022,05
"When I first got it, it did not track properly unless fully charged. I stopped using it and recharged it all last night and now it does not work at all. Lights flash for a few seconds and then it goes black. Wish this product would have worked properly.",2022,05
"I received 2 of these for Christmas, they both stopped working within the first 2 weeks of having them. I emailed customer service as they tell you to and never got a response. I emailed them twice. Junky and a waste of money for the purchaser who gifted them to me.",2022,05
I was a bit too busy with work and school and  missed my window to return this item. The quality of the mouse and USB plug is just horrible. I ordered the mouse with urgency to get a power point project done for schooland had to run to a local discount store to purchase another mouse because the USB piece fell apart and after careful putting it back together the mouse won’t connect.Over I got about 45 minutes of use fromThis product.,2022,05
"I gave gaming 1 star because i don't do gaming. The mouse is worth every penny. Love how it feels, love that it makes no noise. you must use a mouse pad.",2022,05
THIS MOUSE ONLY WORKED FOR 2 WEEKS THEN IT DIED! VERY DISAPPOINTED,2022,05
"Stopped working, very conveniently after return window had closed.",2022,05
"Won’t recharge, lasted not even a week.",2022,05
Works great. Sleeps and comes out of sleep easily. Colorfully not too bright to be a distraction.,2022,05
Works as advertised... Would buy again,2022,05
Great price Great product,2022,05
Tends to lose juice quickly and not so great with my MacBook Pro. Another mouse added to the boneyard,2022,05
Great product,2022,05
"This was a great value and the wireless mouse works well. The colors are fun too, just wish it had a way to keep it on one color.",2022,05
 super cute for the office!  love the one lights!,2022,05
This product is cheap and does not last long. After only one day of use i plug it into the outlet and it does not turn on. I needed a gaming mouse and this one is definitely not it. Extremely upset,2022,05
"The type c extension doesn't work, so it rendered it  useless for my Mac. I am able to use it on my pc for work... just not the intended use I bought it for.. the mouse itself is great. Light, easy to use, fits perfectly in my hand, always connects and is reliable.",2022,05
I bought this mouse a few months ago. It worked very well for a couple of months and now it has quit completely. I’m sorry to say my return time ended in April. Buyer beware!,2022,05
"I like the mouse, it is cheaper quality though, the mouse didnt really look exactly like the picture but overall its not bad.",2022,05
"My son uses it at school. He is 9 years old,  when I asked him this ? He said ""it's good, better than my other one"" that's it",2022,05
"Like other reviews stated this mouse is super nice, smooth, and looks neat but lasted just over the 30 day return window.  I put it on charge for the 4th time since I had received it and the blue light comes on indicating it is charging and goes off some time later indicating it is complete.  When you switch it on the red light flashes and then goes off.  Highly disappointing.",2022,05
The item would charge but then would not turn on or work at all in the computer,2022,05
It's a nice sleek mouse and works relatively well until it stops charging. I had bought it early march this year and now early May it won't charge making it a hunk of useless plastic. Buy with the expectation you will have to buy again and not very long thereafter.,2022,05
"I bought my mouse a few months ago and it was working just fine. Now, the scroll wheel sunk into the mouse and stopped working.",2022,05
excelente producto,2022,05
Doesn’t work.,2022,03
"I tried to get my daughter a nice mouse for her Minecrafting and man, what a waste of $20 this mouse was x 2! It connected to its included dongle just fine, but I almost broke a nail taking the dongle out of the mouse body. If you don't have something slim to wedge in between the dongle and the mouse body, prepare for some ouchies. Do you like the rainbow effect? Well, I hope you also enjoy less than 1 day of battery life. Is your battery dead now? Welp, can't charge and use the mouse at the same time. Do you think it'd be nice to use a long, braided USB cord as a wire for this mouse? Nope, the Micro USB only supports charging...not data. Don't hate yourself? Don't get a budget mouse.If you want a good mouse for roughly $15 more, check out the Razer Basilisk X - it supports Bluetooth & USB, and it has excellent battery life. My son uses it every day for Minecraft/Roblox/YouTube and I purchased it at the end of January. It is now Mid-May and I've changed its single AA only once. You won't be disappointed.",2022,05
Cheap. Charge barely last long and charging stopped working after a couple of months. Don’t buy.,2022,05
My daughter loves it! Cute color and works great!,2022,05
"It’s lightweight, works great, with really decent battery life. I don’t use the lights mode though which probably helps.",2022,05
Really in photo it looks more beautiful and of better quality than when you have it in personThe color has disappointed me since I expected it to be more stylish and with better finishes.,2022,05
Stays charged,2022,05
Piece of junk. doesn't work probably why it's on sale.,2022,05
It stopped working after 3 months right in the middle of my shift at work.,2022,05
Good product,2022,05
We bought this for my son to use and it lasted 3 months before the scrolling wheel broke.,2022,05
 It’s cute and light weight but one drop and it’s done for! I literally dropped it once and it now doesn’t work!,2022,05
"Love the sleek design, easy set up, fast charging, and most importantly how quiet the mouse isIt's not the most ergonomic mouse and it lacks wrist support so I have to stretch a lot more but as long as you're not gaming 24/7 this mouse is great.",2022,05
"It may be pretty to look at but it requires constant charging.  No warning when low on charge so if you are in the middle of using your USB port to hear music or watch a DVD, you have to stop, unplug it just to charge the mouse. Very frustrating.  I'm going back to batteries.",2022,05
 For $10-15 USD you can’t go wrong.,2022,05
"The mouse started off great. I even got two, one for me and one for my son. They both failed about the same time. It charges for hours and then when I switch it on it has a double red blink and does not react. Same thing when plugged in.",2022,05
"It broke at the first fall and it was not a big fall.The inner clips on broke and the other twisted, so I am unable to close it, and simpler does it work.",2022,05
I liked the color and the lights but unfortunately the scroll wheel went out on me. This item only lasted me a little over 3 months.,2022,05
"Laptop slipped of my lap and obviously landed on thw protuding hardware, troubling as i have much to do, ive not  acustomed to the finger pad 100%",2022,05
"Had troubles connecting, when it did finally connect the cursor never appeared only the clickable buttons worked and would access random menus.Returned for full refund.",2022,05
Love it fyi use the usb under mouse and push hard no clear instructions,2022,05
It doesn't charge anymore. . .,2022,05
I was very disappointed when the mouse stopped responding after a few weeks of using it,2022,05
"I’ve had this mouse for 2 months. And the wheel broke. It’s the second mouse I’ve gotten like it and that other mouse wheel broke.It much be cheap plastic.It looks nice, felt nice. But not worth it when you have to buy one every 2 months",2022,05
This has been a great addition to my gaming set up. It's perfect size for my 5 year old who loves using it for homework,2022,05
"The mouse started off okay. It worked like it should for a few weeks but then the battery would not make it through my work day. The charge lasted less each time until suddenly it stopped holding a charge. Like other reviews state, it stopped working literally days after the return window closed. I'll be buying a name brand mouse now.",2022,05
This is the best mouse! Super quite and small. I love it so much! The colors are fabulous!,2022,05
Perfect size for small hands,2022,05
I bought this mouse for my work laptop. The right click on the mouse is constantly getting stuck and the left click seems to take several pushes before it recognizes what it is supposed to do. Overall I wouldn't buy this again. I would definitely recommend spending allitle more and getting a better mouse to get the job done.,2022,05
"This mouse is cheap and I like the colors, but the laser isn’t accurate, so it can be slow and laggy. Occasionally, its entirely unresponsive.",2022,05
Love this mouse,2022,05
I bought this as a wireless mouse. I have used it for less than a month and it doesn’t hold a charge unless it’s plugged in. I will be returning it and I do NOT recommend this product.,2022,05
"Just didn't work for me, could not plug into my Chromebook.",2022,05
Worth it,2022,03
"Very disappointed.  The mouse doesn't hold a charge!  Even if you leave it ""on"" for a short period of time while not using it, you must recharge it.  Would not buy again.",2022,05
I returned the same day received.  Very poor quality and requires a cord to charge - no battery,2022,05
"This lightweight mouse worked fine for about three weeks, then it stopped working. I would plug it in to charge, and after about 20 seconds, it would stop charging. No charge = no power. Disappointing.",2022,05
"cheaply made, breaks after on use. If you want to waste your money get it",2022,05
"My other wireless mouse stopped working for some reason and required batteries, so i had to get another one. I love that it is rechargable and has the lights. the lights change each time you touch the mouse on its side. thats cool. i also love how the top of the mouse is so smooth and the gold color is actually shiny. i didnt know before buying but it has a sleep mode so thats great for if i forget to turn it off. i have to double check the manual but there are 3 switches and i dont know what the middle switch is for since the mouse hasnt worked in that function. i think its cool too that they include the adapter if you need to plug it into a usb-c port to connect to your device. I honestly like it. only other thing is im not sure how i know when its dying, again may be in the manual.",2022,05
I've loved this mouse since I bought the first one. I will continue to use it,2022,05
"I needed a really simple mouse for my laptop, so I got a nice combination for cheap/ease. It fits fairly nicely in my hands, super slim so it fits in my laptop bag without any issues!",2022,05
"Accent lights make it easy to find.  AFTER 97 DAYS THE SCROLLING WHEEL FAILED, not a good buy.",2022,05
It worked very well till it didn’t anymore. I bought this in January and it won’t charge or do anything. Very disappointed,2022,05
"This was a really good mouse, quiet clicks, very lightweight and it moved smoothly over my mouse pad.It fell, opened up a bit, I was able to put it clip it back in, but after the third fall, the ball stopped working. But for the price, it's def worth it.Long battery life, think I charged like middle of every other week. And I used it from weekdays for about 6 hours.",2022,05
This mouse us nit very comfortable.  I keep hitting the R button and bringing up pages I don't want.  The cursor jumps sound the page without my moving the mouse.  Charge doesn't last long.  It's fun to watch all of the flashing colors.,2022,05
"There's a typo on the mouse 🤣Mouse works good, though there is a minor glitch where it tends to not want to move on screen for a couple seconds after touching it after a couple minutes of inactivity.",2022,05
"Cute mouse, but that’s about it. Very flimsy and poor quality feeling. I like that it’s rechargeable. I’ve had this for a few months now and it’s stopped working. It’s charged, clean, clear of debris, and on a mousepad, but still doesn’t work for more than a few seconds. Waste of money.",2022,05
"Got a mouse for my son. The light look cool and it was comfortable. No complaints until the trackball quit working after about 9 days. I contacted the company, they communicated well, and replaced it very quickly. About a week later, the same thing happened again. Great communication and no issues with a refund. So, good communication but not the best mouse.",2022,05
Liked the colors and style east set up but after about 3 weeks of use the scroller stopped working and fell off track only used it a few times out of those 3 weeks.,2022,05
"Bought this to use for my Mac. I'm already on Big Sur (11.x), turns out the mouse is only compatible with 10.x",2022,05
Within 1 month the scroller stopped working.,2022,05
"For a cheap rechargeable mouse, this is great.",2022,05
"Nice size, comfortable,  good battery life and plug in play.",2022,05
I like that I can use the charger it came with to charge it! No batteries required!!,2022,05
It’s work good but not great,2022,05
Use this for my laptop and easy to use and works great. Very smooth. Would definitely recommend.,2022,05
This barely ever needs to be charged for me. I have online schooling so I use the mouse a lot and only have to charge it every once and a while. Its very pretty and good for the price! Makes no sound when clicked which is great.,2022,05
"Great little mouse- precisely what I was looking for except that it only lasted 2 months. I've had it just that long and the scroll wheel is now disconnected and doesn't work anymore. The mouse is still functional otherwise, but I use the scroll wheel constantly for work so I will just keep it as a backup and find something else.",2022,05
The charging stopped working after 4 months and entire mouse stopped working after 5 months,2022,05
It just stopped working out of nowhere. I’m mad I missed my return date.,2022,04
I just received this yesterday and am planning to return it.  Seems very cheaply made product.  Not taking the chance…,2022,04
"So far a great purchase, I bought rose gold and it looks so cute! Mouse works well, slim and compact.",2022,04
When I plug the USB into the computer it takes away my Internet settings. I cannot connect to the Internet and it shows no networks to connect to. I don’t know how to fix it.,2022,04
…..Chinese junk. Lasted 1 month,2022,04
This mouse is great!,2022,04
" So far, so good! Does what it's supposed to do. Worked right out of the box. I like that I don't have to buy batteries for it. It charges quickly, lasts a looking time, and is compatible with my HP Chromebook. It has two settings; solid red color (only when mouse is moving), and slow-changing rainbow (when mouse is moving and/or at rest). The USB tucks away into the bottom of the mouse, which is where you'll find it when you open the box for the first time. Also comes with an adapter and short charging cable.",2022,04
"Loved the product at first, I actually bought two. After a couple weeks they quit charging and now they no longer work.",2022,04
"Ergonomic, smooth, and quiet this is the third one I’ve bought and I’ll never go back to another. One charge lasts more than a week and I never turn mine off",2022,04
I was using it for my laptop that I use for work and school and the mouse stop working in week!! Horrible!,2022,04
The mouse doesn't work now and I am outside the return window. Disappointed beasue i like the feel of the mouse and the sleek design,2022,04
I love this mouse. It works perfectly and I’m not all that tech savvy,2022,04
"Love the sleep mode, keep my mouse charged when I forget to turn it off.",2022,04
Stopped working 5 days after the 30-day cutoff for returns. It worked great while I could use it but of course this is unacceptable. I won't buy from this seller again.,2022,04
"I use it for work! And it’s amazing, glides very nice! I am sure it would be perfect for gaming!",2022,04
Great service fast delivery I got this for my new Laptop I Like it I didnt know that it chages colors I thought that was pretty cool ! when you turn mouse over on the bottom theres a spot where it turns on or off and a picture of a sun and that changes the color of the mouse that is nice Just got this the other day to match my Laptop as its pink rose color and I Love it  it slim and doesnot hurt my fingers when scrollig which I like,2022,04
like it a lot,2022,04
Wanted to match my keyboard and not spend too much money.  This little number is priced just right and the size and shape make it easy to use.,2022,04
 Ive had for about a year and only used it on occasion. It worked pretty good until I started using it on a regular basis. Mouse slowly stopped working more and more until now it doesn’t track any movement at all. Do not buy unless you want to throw away,2022,04
It broke from one say to the next . Sad cause it was cute and very handy but the product just didn’t last long at all.,2022,04
Fun and great to use.,2022,04
It fits my hand and the light show is cool.,2022,04
"battery charge lasts many, many days",2022,04
I don’t like using my mouse on my laptop so having a mouse is helpful. And then it lights up!!,2022,04
I bought this mouse 6 months ago.  I use it CONSTANTLY and have yet to charge it.  For the price point? Steal!,2022,04
"I have been using this with my work laptop, which I use 8-9 hours daily for remote work. I’ve had this for a few weeks and only needed to charge once since then. I really love the feel of it, it’s a near silent and very soft click sound when using buttons. I like the look of it and the lights, so I know when it’s in sleep mode. Turns on and immediately works with one click. Completely operational when plugged in to charge as well. The charge cord is very short but I plugged into the laptop to charge it and it was long enough for me to use it right next to the USB port it was plugged into without being a nuisance. I would love for there to be a way to see the battery life on the mouse, it’s the only thing I would change/add.Very pleased and hope it lasts a long while!Update:This mouse is still going strong, still love it. I use it daily for work, 8+ a day, 5 days a week. Still love the lights lol.My one and ONLY complaint - I wish we could see the battery life of the mouse. I have been charging one every couple of weeks just to be safe (I hate the laptop mouse). It does work when plugged in and charging, tho, so that is nice, I just prefer wireless. Im not knocking off stars due to this at all, just offering a suggestion to somehow let us see the battery life remaining!",2022,04
"Very DISAPPOINTED . . . I bought this for my Kindergarten classroom and the kids loved it.  Last week it totally went black.  No more cool lights . . . No more nothing.  After 7 months, it does not work.  BEWARE if you want to use if for a long period of time.  :(",2022,04
"Bought this to use at work and I absolutely love it! Not only are the changing colorful lights pretty cool, it works really well. However, the best part about this mouse is that it is RECHARGEABLE! Bye, bye batteries!",2022,04
It worked fine until it quit one day. I can't really complain because of the price but I'm going to to try something else to replace it.,2022,04
"Would buy again for $10 if I really needed a mouse. It is not that nice however, it does function so. Cannot really complain. Wouldn't try gaming with it.",2022,04
This thing became erratic after about a month.  I've tried all the fixes I found online and nothing works.,2022,04
This mouse died 6 months after I got it and it spent most of it's time turned off inside a laptop bag.,2022,04
"Fits the hand, charge lasts, however the cord that comes with it could be more sturdy.",2022,04
"Junk.... Charged it and used it several times.... It worked for about a handful of times, charged again. The light on the switch flashes but turns off immediately so that it won't go on even though it is charged. Save your money and by a well known brand",2022,04
Seamless connectivity to my pc,2022,04
"I made the mistake of reading the reviews only after I bought the mouse, because it had 4.5 stars with something like 30,000 reviews so I thought it was fine. I saw a few reviews that said the seller tried to bribe them into removing their review! That made me really regret buying from such an unethical business. I don't think you should buy this mouse even if you're on a budget - there's much better quality mice out there for even less money than this costs.This mouse is very cheaply made. As for performance issues:For one, it's way too thin and lightweight - When using it, it's very easy to knock it out of place and click something by mistake because it's not heavy enough (or grippy enough on the bottom) to stay where you put it. I've never had this issue with a mouse before. The tracking sensor is also way too sensitive - the cursor still moves when you lift the mouse a decent couple centimeters above the surface it's on. This also makes it very hard to put the cursor where you want it on the screen because it's still tracking movement when you lift it up.The cord to charge it is pretty short - although that's not a huge issue, just sort of disappointing. The biggest issue is that the cord does not seem to fit properly into the port on the mouse and takes a bit of manhandling. It felt like I was going to break some of the cheap, thin plastic when I first plugged it in.As for looks:The edges where the ""paint"" or whatever it is on the top are pretty rough, and it even came with some of the paint chipped off. I bought the light pink mouse. It's not nearly as light as it is in the pictures. It's darker and much warmer toned rather than a cool light pink like the picture. It's also not as reflective as the pictures show but that's not a huge deal. You can turn off the RGB lights by the switch on the bottom if you want, but it still emits a red light when using it. I wish it didn't do that - it's ugly and probably wastes more power.",2022,04
Using this mouse for my Dell laptop. Works great!,2022,04
smoothe,2022,04
Very cheaply made. Another you get what you pay for. Suggest you pass.,2022,04
I've bought 2 of these mouses. When the first one broke I thought it might just have been a dud. I really liked the mouse up until that point so I decided to get another one. It's been 6 weeks and the same issues. With both mouses the scroll button broke. While the mouse does still 'technically' work it's super inconvenient and annoying.,2022,04
The mouse is really pretty but the battery life is super short. It doesn't even last my 8hr workday after a full charge :(,2022,04
"When I first got the item the color looked off. I ordered the Blue but I'm fairly positive based on the images I was sent Mint Green. I liked the quiet button clicks and it was nice to have in college classes for a bit because it was so quiet. However, after only a week and a half, the mouse wheel stopped working. I could feel the tension in the wheel was gone so I opened it to investigate and it looked like there was a small plastic rod that rotated with the wheel but the contact point between the rod and wheel was broken so it wouldn't work anymore. I liked the aesthetics of it except for the red led used for the tracking would also overpower the RGB lights. It bothered me but that didn't affect the function. I wish this had worked better.",2022,04
Just wouldn’t connect. Plugged it in and was fully charged. Just didn’t work,2022,04
Worked good for the first 2 months. Used the mouse on a security camera hard drive to review camera footage. Worked fine one time and after that no “cursor “ icon appeared. Tried plugging it back into my desktop and still no cursor icon available. It won’t select anything. Only right click works but can’t scroll to a selection. Luckily my desktop is touch screen so I manually opened up the drives properties and it’s said that All device functions are working properly. Clearly not being able to see a cursor is an issue 🥴,2022,04
"I’ve had this mouse for less than three months now, thought it looked really cool at first. No longer works at all and I’m stuck without a mouse again for my laptop.",2022,04
"Bought in January, it's April and it won't charge so it's useless.",2022,04
wheek scroll was brock,2022,04
"Nice mouse, portable, works great, silent. I like the changing colors",2022,04
"Easy to set up, like that it is rechargeable and don't need batteries.",2022,04
I initially Liked this mouse but after a month it stopped working. Terrible product. Waste of money,2022,04
"I've only had this for a few months, but not only is it really cool looking, it's responsive and comfortable to use.",2022,04
"Perfect mouse for a laptop. I've been using it for a little over 2 months, usually for a few hours everyday and haven't changed to batteries yet. The only ""problem"" I have is I love watching the colors change so much I start to zone out on my work time! Very relaxing.",2022,04
not good,2022,04
"I love how quiet it was without hearing clicking at every move, but unfortunately, it started stalling,freezing and just unusable in less than a month.",2022,04
"Got it for my grandson, for school his chrome book.",2022,04
"This mouse is clunky as it would at times not connect. However, I ordered it in March and now in April, the mouse no longer works… do lot but!!",2022,04
Cool product for kid if the scrolling wheel in middle doesn’t keep breaking.,2022,04
"I got this in the mint green color, and I like that color. The only issue is that it broke in about a month, so if you really need a mouse for your laptop, but if you want a cheap one, then I don't really recommend this product.",2022,04
Great buy,2022,04
"I got this mouse on thursday night. I only charged it for less than 20 minutes (not a full charge) and have been using it for 5 days in a row on the red-light mode only. I thought it would run out of power in a day or two but is still working nicely. The mouse feels comfortable under my palm, not too big or too small. I was ready to be disappointed for the price vs. quality, but so far so good.",2022,04
No complaint.  Great product,2022,04
I like the color and the changing light. The sleep mode is nice and saves battery life when you are not moving the mouse.,2022,04
Sleep mode and charge life is great,2022,02
"Very nice mouse. It's super quiet! Exactly what I wanted. The lights are nice and change on their own. I haven't had to charge it yet, but it gets a ton of time off the initial charge.",2022,04
The scroll wheel broke in the exact same way twice in the last 4 months. We opened the mouse up and it's not a simple fix so the first time we replaced it but this time we're just going with a different brand,2022,04
"When I bought this mouse I loved it. It took me a few tries to get it paired right, but it is a game changer for my laptop. The rechargeable battery life on it is great. I found that if the mouse stopped responding quickly, that it was time to charge it.I purchased it late September and at the end of April my roller has stopped working randomly. It worked and then I went to use it an hour later and it no longer does. The scrolling wheel is an essential feature for me with my laptop. I'm disappointed.",2022,04
"product works as advertised. no issues. until the wheel simply stopped working one day, about 6 months in. you don’t realize how much you use said wheel until um you don’t have that function anymore. otherwise, great product.",2022,04
I got a white one and the LEDs shine thru the plastic. The pointer tracking laser noticeably strobes. I will get something better made,2022,04
A very nice upgrade and replacement mouse with no cords and no batteries. Perfect!,2022,04
This mouse is ok except for the battery life. It didn’t make it through a full 8hr day of work before shutting off and needing to be charged again.,2022,04
"I would not recommend this mouse to anyone. No right click available on the mouse - does not work.  Fell apart already. It is very difficult to ""click"".  The only plus is that it's a pretty color!  Does not work!!!!! Very poor quality.",2022,04
I’ve gone through 3 or 4 of these in less than a year. They are not durable in my teenagers hands. I’m sure they are not the most gentle with them  either. I buy them because they are cheap and we just need to get through the school year. I have switched brands recently to see if it’s them or this brand that just breaks. It’s always the scrollers that break.,2022,04
After the first use the mouse no longer holds a charge!,2022,04
"This mouse works as advertised. The changing lights on the side of it are what drew me in when browsing for a new mouse on Amazon. I don't really like the slim feel to it, I feel like my hand would get tired after using it for extended periods of time. I also was looking for specifically a USB-C mouse, and to make this one work with USB C you have to use the included adapter, which ends up sticking out quite a ways on the edge of your computer. This is clearly stated in the advertisement, I just didn't pay enough attention when I bought the mouse.",2022,04
"The price of this mouse was cheap, and you will get just that with this product. It serves its purpose OK. I like the color changing LED lights. But this mouse is too lightweight for my liking, and my hand is too big to fit on the mouse comfortably. It feels like there is a lag when moving the arrow, just an overall not great feel compared to my mouse on my work/office computer.",2022,04
Mouse stopped working after 3 months.,2022,04
Totally stopped working after 3 months.only a 30 day refund policy.,2022,04
I liked the mouse until the USB C to USB dongle broke it is way to long on a moving laptop,2022,04
Fast charger and beautiful design!!,2022,04
Easy to use,2022,04
Only got to use it for a month and then after that I tried to charge it and but it didn't charge and didn't work. Not worth getting it. Doesn't last long.,2022,04
"I loved this mouse when I first got it. It moves nicely and the colors around the base is awesome. I could tell it was cheaply made, but didn't think more of it. Just went to use it now and the scroller in the middle is busted. It rotates, but it doesn't do anything on my computer.",2022,04
"Literally from the box it won't light up or download the software to be able to use. My mouse won't move and it says ""compatible with mac"" that is absolutely untrue. Can you explain to me why that's stated in the description? It's the only reason I purchased this and it doesn't work. Disappointed.",2022,04
2nd one I bought,2022,04
smol,2022,04
Don’t buy this bought it twice and it broke down quickly! Very cheap product,2022,04
"I like that this mouse os sleek in design has a long battery life, and is easy to set up. I often forget to turn it off but that doesn't matter because it goes into a sleep mode to preserve battery. The only concern My tablet has a C type so the converter is helpful. The only thing that I would change is that the converter doesn't fit inside the mouse for storage so you have to be careful not to lose it if you detach it from the tablet.",2022,04
The scroll ball thing broke and doesn’t work after a month of very light usage. I would definitely not recommend purchasing this mouse.,2022,04
At first it worked perfectly fine. Then I notice the movements on my PC screen became slow and laggy. Then it finally did. Waste of time and money.,2022,04
Nice sleek design however does not hold the charge for long. It’s frustrating when the computer is turned on and it doesn’t come on after switching it on.,2022,04
"It worked great. I liked the low profile.  However, it started to act up a few days before and then stopped working after 5 months.  I tried it on two laptops with the same results.",2022,04
Stop working in 2 weeks,2022,04
"I get so many compliments about this mouse. I move location to location for my job and it’s held up just fine. Quiet click, smooth functionality, fun color changing LED… I love it! The only negative is that the charging cord is short and doesn’t also operate the mouse when plugged in, so make sure you have two USB plugs when needing a charge.",2022,04
"The mouse does not work without a mousepad. As such, I’m going to return this product",2022,04
"I had the mouse working for one day, then I could not use it any further. The mouse pointer had a mind of it's own and would take over it's own movement. What a disappointment! I was hoping not to go back to battery operated mouse.I say do not buy this product!!!",2022,04
was working fine then surly the clicker in the middle stoped working,2022,04
"Purchased this in September 2021, worked great until April 2022, then completely died! Won’t charge or turn on. Doesn’t work anymore. Got 7 good months from it! Won’t be buying another one.",2022,04
Failed after three month of use(from Jan 17 2022 to Apr 21 2022).Charging is not possible.It is too late to exchange.Do not waste a money.,2022,04
It’s good for in the go only thing is I have bad wrists and it isn’t 100% ergo for me.,2022,04
"Used this for work and it’s perfect. Quick and responsive, cute appearance, and very light. Battery life last a good amount of time before requiring charge. Love the lights!",2022,04
"Liked this little mouse.  It holds a charge but after 2 months it no longer works.  Even after fully charging the right mouse button will work so i know it is connected.  Uninstalled the device, rebooted the laptop and nothing fixed the issue.",2022,04
The USB C adapter is ill fitting and won't keep charging the mouse unless it is held and tilted just so.  Luckily I have another adapter and that is working fine so the mouse itself is good.,2022,04
Had a issue and they made up for it. Not sure why it stopped working but they are sending a new one.,2022,04
I only used it for a week and the scroller stopped working,2022,04
"I have had this mouse for almost 2 months, and I use it at least 12 hours a day. I haven't been paying close enough attention to amount of hours until it needs charging, but in the time I have had it I have only had to charge it 3 times, and I was able to continue to use it while charging.I do use it for gaming, but my games don't require fast and accurate like RPG's etc..so I can say yes, it does gaming for me, but I'm unsure about speed games.Pros:*It's slim and long so it feels good in my hand even though it's not ""ergonomically"" built, and it fits nicely in my carry case.*The colors are soothing*You have options for either standard USB or USB-C for chargingThe Cons:*The on/off button is teeny weeny and sits flush with the hole. you need nails or a stylus to turn it on*The sensor underneath sometimes has issues with the mouse pad and it ""skates"" over the pad. A good shake usually gets it right.All in all, it's priced reasonably for what you get.**update: like everyone else, just a few days past the 30 day return cutoff my mouse also died. No power, wouldn't charge.. dead. I contacted the Manufacturer MOTOTO INC and they said they have a 1 year warranty on this mouse and they would be happy to send out a new one.",2022,04
Works perfectly for work computer,2022,04
I bought two of them. We didn't use them every day but they both broke after 3 months.It is a waste of money and you should not buy them.,2022,04
I would give it no stars if I could.,2022,04
nice that you can carry with you the mouse along with its USB key,2022,04
The scroll wheel broke after 2 months. I have food in my fridge that’s lasted longer. Not worth it.,2022,04
This item shuts off and on while you’re using it. I have to smack it onto my desk to get it to wake up. Piece of junk,2022,04
"OMG! I LOVE this mouse!! It works great with my laptop! I just plug in the little key into the USB port and hello!I REALLY like that it's rechargeable, so saving a ton on batteries. I can't use it while it charging though.The clicks are very quiet, so I don't annoy even myself with the noise. And I love looking at it because of the colors added!! Of course, you can turn off the pulsing colors to save charge, but who would want to??? Unless you needed to...Also, it's a bit small, good for travel, and fits a woman's hand. If you're a man, this mouse may be a bit too small even if it looks cool for gaming.As much as I use my HP laptop, this mouse is a must!Christa",2022,04
NO battery life!!!,2022,04
It broke within 3 days of having this mouse. I accidentally dropped it as I was picking up the mouse and my computer. It cannot sustain a fall from less than 2 feet. Definitely did enjoy it for the 3 days I had it.,2022,04
its a cool mouse till i had to recharge it plugged in the cable that came with it and it started getting hot until i saw smoke ripped it out almost burned my self regular phone charger works fine tho...,2022,04
I love this mouse. Its slim and fits perfectly in my hand! Highly recommend for daily use,2022,04
My mouse worked for 2 months and on the third month it wasn't scrolling anymore and the mouse itself was just falling apart. Don't spend you money on this item.,2022,04
"I just received this product today and even though there were numerous good reviews, I unfortunately cannot leave a positive one due to the fact that this is useless due to a non functional OTG plug.",2022,04
Needed a wifi mouse for my HP Chromebook. I liked the fun lights and the price was good. Set up was quick and easy via bluetooth. Works great.,2022,04
The roller stopped working,2022,04
"I bought a different one of these in the fall and it worked for a short time. I thought I was buying from a different company this time, but this mouse also has failed me. DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE! I charged it and still, nothing.",2022,04
I charged the mouse for over 6 hours and never even charged. it doesn't even work. turn it on and it blinks red. I have already started a return. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!,2022,04
I needed a new mouse for work. I didn't want to deal with batteries and this is exactly what I was looking for. It's a light and smooth.,2022,04
The wheel is already broken. I only use it for office use and I bought it about a month ago. Very disappointed.,2022,04
"Started out great but after about 3 weeks and when the return window closed will not hold a charge. It’s charging when the blue light is on … only stays on for 30 second after plugging in. If there were 0 stars I would give it that, I didn’t even have enough time to really use it only got about 5 uses before it wouldn’t charge.",2022,04
slik . nice color. same as photos . I love it also its actually wireless and no need battery. (some still one AAA battery even if its says wirless) . bought so many of this to my whole family,2022,04
We tried and have hard time trying to connect then it disconnects/no light/power for the MacBook. So don’t use this for any apple devices it does it should work but gives hard time get frustrated. Better for those other computers/laptop,2022,04
Regular use,2022,04
"Absolute garbage. Listen to the negative reviews and the ones saying the company is spamming them begging to remove their posts. The lights are haywire with no pattern, randomly switching off and on. DPI is NOT adjustable, pretty sure that's a lie. Feels like the lowest grade plastic I've ever felt. Does not track. Lights will give you a seizure. Without a doubt this company is scamming you.",2022,04
"Great mouse, I like the colors and how easy it was to connect to my laptop and Tablet so I can play Baldurs Gate on my tablet way easier now. Charging doesn't take long at all either. Some with large hands may not like it to much it is a bit smaller",2022,04
When it worked it was good.  Now it no longer connects to the dongle or stays on.  I’ve made sure it is charged both through a wall outlet and USB port.,2022,04
I just got this not very long ago. It just stopped tracking on the page and just out right quit! It is a piece of junk to me and I would never buy this again.I am not happy and wasted my money on this.,2022,04
Very slim. Stays charged for a long time,2022,04
"When this gets low on battery, it starts to ""flicker"" out where the mouse will stop and start sending information. So your clicks won't register and the mouse will stop moving across the screen.The added problem is that it gets to this low battery point after about 45min to an hour of use, and then it acts like that for the next several hours. It's nearly impossible to keep it charged up that long.It's a shame because I love how stylized it is. But it's basically unusable.",2022,04
"Tried this product on three different computers, could not get the unit to work on any of them.  Charged as per the instructions, and using the USB, the driver was found.  However, the unit would not operate at all.",2022,04
This mouse is sleek and has a great feel. It doesn't require batteries so it is a great mouse to have. The LED light is an added bonus.,2022,04
Given to wife as a gift. She loves it.,2022,04
Serves its purpose for everyday use. I’m a teacher who uses their laptop daily. Worked great for about 4 months and then the middle wheel stopped working.,2022,04
after only 2 months it will no longer hold a charge,2022,04
The wireless connection works great and mouse looks sleek and cool. Especially for the price.,2022,04
Mouse works fine and the grandkids love them. They mainly use them for school work and for gaming.,2022,04
"Have used this mouse for more than a month now. The cursor jumps around unreliably on the screen, making it difficult to navigate. Battery life is not very long before needs recharging. Feels very cheaply made in hand. Do not recommend.",2022,04
"Battery inside the mouse is it not recharable. It’s not working after battery life gone. So after 3 months of usage it’s not working. I try to change the battery but it’s very difficult to change battery. Need to open the top cover and removing batter is not easy. Even After I changed the battery also, it not working. It’s looks like one time use only.",2022,04
I bought this mouse in November 2021 and it just died (April 2022). I used this for working 40 hours a week and I even took 6 weeks of for maternity and wasn’t using this mouse. So really this mouse only lasted 4 months. The USB Bluetooth that plugs into the computer died. The mouse will still light up when I turn it Off and on but then doesn’t do anything after that. It was a great mouse while it worked though! I guess I shouldn’t be upset with this mouse compared to the price. You get what you pay for!,2022,04
"This product stopped working for me after two days, it was fine but now it no longer charges and doesn’t even work while it’s plugged in.",2022,04
My son loves his gaming mouse,2022,04
"DO NOT BUY IT!!!  This mouse stopped working. They built it enough to last a few months so it's out of amazon's return policy... After that, it doesn't work!",2022,04
Careful. It's not bluetooth. I had to order my daughter a new one an I kept this one for myself.,2022,04
"Sleep mode turns on too fast for me, however I really enjoy the mouse overall - just use for work/travel, not gaming.",2022,04
"Love how it looks when it changes colors, comes with adapter/charging cord and live the fact that it is rechargeable and the price was amazing",2022,04
Shipping took a long time. If you are wanting a mouse quickly buy some place else. THEN it stopped working after 2 months. Stay away.,2022,04
"Stoped working since the first day ,doesn’t hold the charge and gets disconnected , I have to turn it on and off a few times in order to connect it again to the computer , I don’t recommend to by this product .",2022,04
Mine is not working after a month of use,2022,04
I bought this brand for the conveniance of using adapter provided with the product for USB-C. The adapter is so loose it falls off. Tried in 3 different computers that has USB-CSame problem.I have 30 days to return. Let me check how long the battery holds good before charge.,2022,04
Cute color and lights.Works great.,2022,04
Loved the mouse until the scroll wheel stopped working.  Opened it up and the wheel has broken. Always used with care. I wouldn't suggest buying if you're a gamer or need to do a lot of scrolling.,2022,04
"It was a nice, quiet mouse but about 6 months in, I've had issues charging with different and the original charging cord. The charge does not last very long either. I really wanted to like this but I will be getting a new mouse. I only use this for work as I work remote.",2022,04
I love this mouse. It is sleek and fits perfectly in the palm of my hand. I love that it lights up beautiful colors. It is rechargeable so you don’t have to worry about finding batteries. Best purchase I made. I highly recommend this mouse.,2022,04
"I’ve enjoyed this mouse for the most part, it’s everything it mentions in the description. However my scroll wheel just randomly broke after only a month of using. I purchased the mouse for work purposes and the scroll literally broke during a project.",2022,04
"I have had 2 of these. The first mouse I ordered worked fine until the mouse just felt loose and didn’t respond. I was able to get a replacement and was satisfied. The replacement did the same thing. I got it in Jan and today the scroll wheel just felt loose and didn’t respond. Waste of money, do not recommend.",2022,04
Failed to work in 3 months,2022,04
Its cute but it didn't work for my Microsoft labtop.,2022,04
"This piece of junk must have a program to discontinue working 3 days after the return date YOU put on it of March 31, 2022!battery will not hold a charge.I guess I will go back to buying from Costco they give 90 days return on electronics",2022,04
Looks beautiful but I couldn’t get it to sink to my 2021 MacBook Air. Saddened,2022,04
"I just love this, the lights are awesome….going to buy more",2022,04
My mouse stopped working within two weeks. Waste of money :(,2022,04
"Its a nice mouse, good size but the scrolling wheel doesn't roll anymore, I've only had it for a month and it broke.",2022,04
"Normal daily use for a few weeks. Scroller suddenly caved in today and stopped working. Positive reviews must be from people who haven’t owned it for long, or mine was just damaged during shipping. Nevertheless, I honestly didn’t know computer mice could even break. Returning.",2022,04
I bought this for working at home/general use. I was sick of my old mouse running out of batteries when I didn't have any. Works great for general use and battery lasts a while but I haven't done any button mashing games with it. My only complaint is the USB remote plugin fits tight into the underside for storage. You have to dig with your nail to remove it. Small infrequent task but for me if it was corrected its an ideal computer mouse.,2022,04
"Really liked this mouse for the first week. It then became pretty useless. Tried to recharge, reinstall and all the other hacks. Still won’t accurately track worth beans. Off to the donation pile. Can’t recommend",2022,04
"When I got it, I was excited for the USB charging and the cool lights, but this mouse has been a lot of trouble. It will lose connection easily and I'll have to click 4 or 5 times sometimes before actually clicking on what I want.",2022,04
"Okay, so, I cannot answer honestly about the gaming capabilities of this mouse. My husband is the gamer. I can however, let you know about my general usage opinion...First off, it's pretty. I love the color and I love that it lights up on the sides. There is a setting on the back that allows you to turn off the lights to save battery drain. I've been using it for 4 days, pretty consistently and haven't needed to charge it.There wasn't any software or drivers that needed to be installed in order for it to be used. I just plugged in the small USB and it immediately worked.That's all I can say at this point since I haven't had it that long. I will update this review in a few months and include any issues I may experience and any new opinions I develop...",2022,04
"I bought this on October 29, 2021 and it stopped working on April 6, 2022. It started acting up on the 5th where the responsiveness was sketchy. I charged it that night and the next day it didn’t power up.",2022,04
It only worked for 6 months and then it died. I have used different mouses before for years  and I have never experienced moused died until this one died.,2022,04
"It last a long time ( I charge it maybe every 3-4days ) maybe once a week; I go to school 3 times a week and I’m in nursing school so a lot of homework, just purchased but it’s already making a noise when I scroll up or down. :/",2022,03
" If you have big hands, I don’t recommend you buying this. Also with the lighting I really dislike it! If you look at the video it goes through the mouse and you can see all the the stuff inside! Very disappointed. Overall, it’s a good and sturdy mouse, just thought they could’ve worked on the exterior more.",2022,04
"I'm a teacher so I don't want to be attached to my computer at the front the whole day. This mouse keeps a good charge, allows me to walk around my class the whole time- stays attached to me, & the colors just add a bit of fun to it.",2022,04
I really like this mouse. It's perfect size and I love that it charges. Holds the charge for a long time.,2022,04
"It is exactly as depicted.  My old mouse just wasn't working correctly, even with a new battery, I was banging on it to get it to respond.  This one is just as advertised, changes colors and responds on just a slight touch.  I LOVE IT !",2022,04
"I like the shape and the way the mouse works, unfortunately, I can't even make it through a whole day of work without it needing to be charged again.",2022,04
I use it for working at home and it gets the job done for the cost. It's not extravagant but it does what I need it to do. I would recommend it!,2022,04
Easy to use  and light,2022,04
No dislikes,2022,04
I like everything about it,2022,04
It worked well for a couple of weeks but now there is a significant lag between where I move the mouse and where it actually goes. Do not waste your money.,2022,04
"THE SCROLLING FEATURE STOPPED BY APRIL 5,2022. THE MOUSE WILL NOT SCROLL A PAGE USING THE SCROLL BUTTON ON TOP OF THE MOUSE. NOT GOOD!!",2022,04
"I loved this mouse--it is super lightweight and the color is lovely. Sometimes I would forget to charge it after a week/week and a half, so that was on me to try to remember. But just yesterday, it stopped charging. Usually the light turns blue when it's charging, which is a great indicator, so I left it overnight to charge while plugged into my laptop. This morning when I tried to use the mouse, it didn't work. I thought maybe I hadn't plugged it in properly, but just now when I plugged it in (tested out several different USB ports on my laptop), the blue charging indicator light flickered for a second and then went out. It seems that this mouse is not charging anymore, making it basically useless. :(",2022,04
I like the sleek feeling and the multi-colour while in use and very very soft clicks💜💜💜,2022,04
"Good product, awesome price",2022,04
"I like the feel and look of this mouse. I bought it as a deal of the day. I really like how it changes colors and how smooth it feels. I also love that you can recharge it. Only dislike is that I review and edit important documents for work and sometimes the cursor would move unexpectedly and will cause me to type something I wasn't trying to type. I'll have to  undo whatever I did. Other than that, good price and quality!",2022,04
"This mouse worked just long enough for me not to be able to return it.  Not sure what went wrong, but it just gave out and that was it.",2022,04
Loved the change of lights and the fell under my hand. Great mouse.,2022,04
"Wheel stop working after a few months. Wouldn’t recommend, now unable to get a replacement mouse since it’s outside of the return window.",2022,04
This mouse is junk. The battery charge does not last. It is rechargeable but you can't use your computer while it is charging.,2022,04
This mouse is so slick and smooth. It is very quiet with the clicking. Love it!!,2022,04
Nunca funciono,2022,04
"Loved at first. Very cute, loved the scrolling and clicking. Bought for work and used for a couple of weeks and noticed my thumb hurting a lot. Felt like I pulled something in it. Noticed it was worse when using the mouse. Switched to my old mouse that is ergonomic and my thumb is improving. If it’s for minimal use it’s probably ok, but definitely not for daily use at the office",2022,04
"This is for doing school work and casual browsing. Being a gamer, I wouldn't use this for gaming for anyone who is asking, but as a standard wireless mouse it works great with no concerns as of yet. I like that you don't have to replace disposable batteries and it charges quickly via a charging cable that comes with the mouse, as well as instructions (you won't need them as it's very simple to figure it all out). The color changing lights are a nice touch that my 9 year old loves. Would strongly recommend, especially for the price. I enjoy the product so far, especially for school work and internet browsing.",2022,04
"I use this mouse for my laptop only when I travel.  After about 3 times using it, the scroll no longer works even when completely charged.  unfortunately with such little use I didn't have much time to notice the defect and the return window has closed.  Wouldn't recommend it.",2022,04
"I get it as a spear mouse, so I didn’t start using it when I get it. It only worked for one day. I didn’t drop it or anything it just stop working.Update: the seller reach out to me after seeing this review and agree to refund for the purchase.",2022,04
Too much bother to charge when at the office cannot leave on my desk for fears of loosing it,2022,03
"I love it silently clicks, automatically goes to sleep conserving battery and slick design",2022,03
I bought this to use at work as they only provided a wired mouse. I charged it before taking it in and it's been 2 weeks now and I haven't had to recharge it yet. It fits comfortably into my hand and is lightweight.,2022,03
"As with several other reviews here, the one I purchased lasted several months, until it just stopped tracking mid-swipe.  I thought maybe it just needed a recharge, as that's what it has done in the past when I forgot to charge it overnight... but no, it's more like it just shorted out... works for a swipe and a click and then stops again. Kinda sucks because it's a really cool and fun mouse with the LED lights and the charging vs. batteries. I guess I'll look now to see if the warranty will help a girl out...",2022,03
"I have only used this a shirt time, it's alright, it does take a minute to get used to the low profile.  My biggest complaint is that it didn't come with a charger as stated.  I now have to find a charger that will fit, or spend more money to purchase a charger just to ensure I can recharge it.",2022,03
First one broke immediately - same day! For another one sent as replacement and that broke in 3 days. Garbage . Do not buy.,2022,03
I’ve had the mouse for about a month and it works great. I use it everyday M-F for work (8+ hours) and I’ve only have had to charge it once after the initial charge. I recommend for sure.,2022,03
"Unfortunately I missed the return window by less than a month - I do a lot of panning around for my work with the middle scroll wheel button, and the button has issues about half the time where it doesn't register that I clicked or gets stuck. It's cute, but I wouldn't buy it again.Update:Just wrote this review a couple days ago, the scroll wheel just broke fully, no more intermittent use. I use it a lot, but I bought it literally two months ago.",2022,03
I love this mouse! It matches the decor in my home office perfectly!,2022,03
"I purchased this mouse on March 18, 2022. All of sudden the mouse just don't want to move in the directions I need it to!!! Each time I move the mouse to different templates or screens it move, then pause, then move a little, and pause again. I would not recommend the mouse to anyone. Worst mouse I've ever purchased.",2022,03
"The fact that it has a quiet mechanism -no sound whatsoever during clicking- was great. But even though I only used it for my desktop computer at work (4-5 days a week), it is not working right now! I did not carry it around or used it for more than a hour during each day, basically because I use my laptop most of time. 10 months is a pretty premature time frame to not function.",2022,03
Very cheap quality.The lights don't look like the photo. It just changes from one color to another and never looks rainbow like in the photos.Also buttons are not silent.,2022,03
It’s okay not quiet at all,2022,03
Used for my MAC Latop,2022,03
"I could not rate the other categories (ergonomics, sleep mode or gaming) because it never worked!Wish I had paid more attention to the 1star reviews😡Unfortunately I missed the return by date.Wish I had paid more attention to the 1star reviews😡DO NOT BUY!!!",2022,03
I use my mouse pretty so often and it’s lasted about 3 weeks before I had to charge it!,2022,03
I like that this cute mouse holds charge for days and is rechargeable. No more batteries dying on me.,2022,03
I really like this mouse.  It works great and is really cool looking.  I love the alternating color lights around it and since it's rechargeable you don't have to worry about a short battery life.  I work on my computer 40+ hours a week and I find I only need to charge it every 2-3 weeks.  So periodically I just plug it into my laptop when I go to sleep so it is always good to go.,2022,03
Stopped working in 29 days,2022,03
The scroll wheel stopped working right after the return window closed so I can't even return it...,2022,03
Sadly the roller ball stopped working 😒,2022,03
Smooth Glide,2022,03
"Did not function, even after charging and plugging it in.  Returned.",2022,03
This mouse looked nice and felt comfortable but the usb-c adapter did not fit so I had to return it,2022,03
Really cute mouse but only used it once and now it wont even turn on.,2022,03
I have been using this mouse for 5-6 weeks now and I have no complaints! It goes to sleep on its own and comes back on easily with a click. No delays or problems connecting to Bluetooth! I do wish I had a way to know what the battery life was but I just hook it up every 3-4 days and it hasn’t died on me yet!,2022,03
I absolutely love this mouse. It's well built and has so many features that similarly priced mice don't have. It's so whisper quiet and smooth as can be. It's also rechargable which helps out a ton.,2022,03
The mouse scrolled only worked for one day then stopped. Everything else works and lights are very pretty,2022,03
I love this so much. I’m so happy with this that I order two.,2022,03
Didn’t last.  Worked for a short while!  I guess you get what you pay for! 🤬,2022,03
"I absolutely loved this mouse. It worked great, the battery lasted for days, and it fit my hand so well. I'm only giving it a low rating because after a month and three days, it quit working. It will not turn on anymore.",2022,03
Straight out of the box the left click button doesn’t work. Completely useless. Sending back. Don’t waste your time like I have.,2022,03
"I haven’t had it long and it just stop working. It’s not in sleep mode, It also says that the port has used all it space for the usb.",2022,03
 Product is not compatible with the the description started for this item. I Will be making sure to get my refund returned.,2022,03
"I really want to like this mouse even more than I do... the colors are cute, but it has a flicker that just goes consistently. I wish I could continue to use this but I think I am going to have to get something else. The flicker drives me nuts. I charged it fully and there is no reason it should not work when I just got it today. it would also be nice if the charge cord was long enough that you could use it while it was charging.",2022,03
Came like this. I tried popping it back in but it keeps on popping back out. Wouldn't recommend.,2022,03
"Returned since it was missing the USB-C adapter, this is the only reason why I purchased it since I needed USB port for my flashdrive.",2022,03
It Works Excellent. It is very awesome,2022,03
The usb dongle broke for the mouse and is now completely useless. I wish the seller sold replacements so I can use my mouse again!,2022,03
"I only used this mouse a few times, and the wheel scroll broke after 2 months; would other wise be 5/5 stars",2022,03
" Was hoping for a light weight mouse to use with my laptop. Instead I seem to have purchased a red dead mouse. The only color it has is red, and it doesn't function at all besides a weak light. Not impressed.",2022,03
Its perfect,2022,03
"Directions suck, charger sucks, pretty color",2022,03
"Worked great at first.  After about a month the sensor stopped working.  Too late to exchange or return now.  I use this for work.  Might be worth it to invest in something of better quality.  Looks nice, that’s about it.",2022,03
"The mouse is comfortable to use. I notice while using it there is a bit of lag. I would recommend if the slim design is what you are looking for. I would not recommend for gaming, I use it for work.",2022,03
Just as advertised.,2022,03
Use at work works great,2022,03
"Third different one I purchased like this because of all the positive reviews, can't believe them. Garbage right out of the box again, won't pair with the USB receiver & won't hold a battery charge. All done with these rechargeable garbage wireless mice.",2022,03
I bought this for my grandson to use with his Chromebook for school.  He is loving it.,2022,03
I have held back writing a review on this mouse based on some of the comments that it would die on them or it became unreliable after a while.  It has not been the case for me.  I have had it for several months now and it is very reliable and maintains all of its functions intact.  I would recommend the mouse.,2022,03
The connection from mouse to laptop isn’t constant. The sleep function is convenient but the mouse doesn’t have a good reaction time. I had to really press down on the left click for the mouse to do anything.,2022,03
"The scroller broke and I only used it about 3 times in total the rest of the time it sits in my bag. The lights are dim, I don't like how small it is. It does not have the best tracking, the clicking is louder than expected. It also just feels cheap. I would not buy it if I could do it again, go for a more quality one somewhere else.",2022,03
 At first I really liked this mouse! It was lightweight and had a sleek design. It ended there! Every time I go to use the mouse throughout the day I have to return it on even when it’s already in the on position. Anyone that is used to any other type of wireless mouse and you just use it anytime will quickly become annoyed with this mouse. The fact that you have to flip the switch on and off every time you go to use it makes it a poor choice!,2022,03
"The scroller broke after 7 weeks of intermittent use (approximately 8 hours per day, 3 days per week).",2022,03
Like how it fits in my hand but it kept stop working. Then after 2 months stopped all together. Do not get it,2022,03
 Love everything about this product. Like the setup and quick syncing to my monitor and system.,2022,03
"After a few months of use, obviously past the return window, the scroll wheel on the mouse does not track any scrolls and spins almost like a wheel on a skateboard. The LED’s also stopped working. If I were to purchase again, it would have to be considerably less with the frequency I’d have to buy them.",2022,03
The mouse worked great and then one afternoon as I was working the middle center stopped working. Couldn’t use it to scroll up and down anymore. Not even two months old and it’s not working.,2022,03
Great most for extended casual use.Love that I can recharge it AND use it at the same time so there's no down time or waisted batteries,2022,03
Love the simplicity of the design and overall product definitely would recommend.,2022,03
Works ok with just the standard USB dongle but we purchased to use with a Mac that only has a usb-c and it doesn’t work with the adapter. I contacted the company through email but they never responded.,2022,03
"After 3 months, it does not work any more.",2022,03
tracking,2022,03
The only adjustment I personally needed to make was learning to work the sleep mode and click the button to wake it back up. Other than that I love this mouse for work. The lights on it still work almost 2 months later with no issue the charge on the mouse plugs into a standard Micro USB cord and the mouse will hold charge with daily use for about 3-5 days. I usually just end the evening plugging in to a micro usb port and I am always good to go. grat buy and will replace with the same when the time comes.,2022,03
"nice size, fits the palm very nicely.  LED lightshow superfluous but i can live with it.  my old mouse went to mouseville, you know...the one down in tallahassee, FL !  LOL.  nice mouse for the buck.  could do worse.",2022,03
Stopped working after 4 uses. The scrolling wheel isn’t working.Update:I told the company about the issue with my mouse. They immediately sent a replacement. Works good lets see if this one lasts,2022,03
I can't get through the morning without this mouse losing its charge.  I would rather a battery!,2022,03
"This is cheap quality mouse.After  3 month of using, the rotating wheel broke. Now I can’t return it because it past the warranty.",2022,03
Color ..shape..size..weight everything is okay..but stopped working after few months..Update reviewThe seller has sent me a new mouse and this is working fine. I really appreciate the gesture.,2022,03
I've had my mouse for just over a month and the scroll tracker stopped working. Now I need to buy a new mouse.,2022,03
Worked good at first. Now after only very little use in two months time it won't take a charge. I would definitely stay away fro.this product,2022,03
Could not get it to work.,2022,03
mouse wheel randomly broke 2 months after purchasing mouse...pretty disappointed in this....,2022,03
This mouse worked for a day and then stopped. It was very comfortable to use and silent click which was nice. But it stopped working so it’s pointless.,2022,03
"It's cute looking, comfortable. Except short uncomfortable charging cord (just use battery!), it was great.And then broke after 2 weeks. Just stopped.",2022,03
"This is made with low quality. The adapter for USB-C doesn’t work, as in it doesn’t even fit into a USB-C port (I tried multiple to make sure this was the common denominator). The mouse comes apart too easily. The battery life is poor. Do not waste your money buying.",2022,03
"Buy Buy Buy IT!!!!!!!!Its so quiet, so soft and so comfortable. Its easy to travel with and connectivity is great. Battery life is amazing!",2022,03
I was enjoying the mouse but after 50 days it malfunctioned and the rotary portion did not work.,2022,03
"The mouse worked well for a couple days but then intermittently started cutting out, and after a week it wouldn’t stay turned on for more than 2 seconds despite it being fully charged. It’s very cute but unfortunately will be going back.",2022,03
Randomly turns off/dies after a short period of time,2022,03
Works on my 2022 MacBook Air. Battery life is really good and the mouse feels good and clicks are very satisfying. Only downside is the adaptor is big and ugly.,2022,03
This mouse was delivered missing 1 of the track strips on the bottom of the mouse. I decided to use it anyways since that shouldn’t impact the function. It worked for a few days and then started having problems. I have to click several times before I can get a response from it. It also barely holds a charge.,2022,03
It really lives up to the silent clicking making it comfortable in a way. The batter also seems to last quite a few days if you turn it off when it’s not in use. It also has various light patterns when you click the button in the middle. The silent clicking is what really gets me.,2022,03
Already stopped working exactly after the return window closed.,2022,03
No need for further comments here. This product will speak for itself,2022,03
I really loved the size and feel as well as how quiet it was. But it only lasted about 8 months before it completely crapped out and never worked again. I suppose it’s a good short term solution.,2022,03
"It's size is perfect for both travel and for my hands. The LED is a great feature and works just as well as the wired one for my PC. I even bought my mother one, and she loves it too.",2022,03
This mouse stopped working not even 3 weeks after I started using it. Not worth it.,2022,03
"Love this mouse! It’s very smooth and the battery life last pretty long. The led lights are bright but not too distracting if u like to game in the dark like i do. I ended up losing the small piece that goes plugs into my computer tho i wish i could just order that piece. Also if the charger was a bit longer that would be better, i hate trying to use the mouse while plugged in charging it has no range. Other than that it’s a good buy",2022,03
I charged it. It still will not work. The mouse still will not work.,2022,03
This mouse came in handy when I needed it most after my other one came up missing.,2022,03
"This product works intermittently. I’ve made sure to charge it, and even with a full charge, it won’t click every time when I try to do so or it will get stuck with and without a mouse pad.",2022,03
Worked great till the roller broke. Used 3 times.,2022,03
Not for tablets and won’t accept a return.,2022,03
the mouse doesn't use batteries but if you charge it it dies in like an hour. its a piece of crap,2022,03
"I love this little mouse! Very well built and sturdy (dropped it twice and nothing happened to it), the colors do not fade, fun lighting, reliable, and very long charging/battery life! I use it almost every day, and haven’t had to charge it in weeks! I ended up buying another one for my daughter, and it’s just as well made!",2022,03
I bought 5 months ago and it stopped working. It’s cheap. I suggest not buying this.,2022,03
It's nice looking and the wife absolutely loves it and it's vibrant colors. I got her the mint green one and it works like a champ. I didn't like the feel of a big flat mouse under my hand but she said that it isn't a problem and likes it so that's the important thing.,2022,03
Worked great for about 2 weeks and then the battery kept dying faster and faster.  Now it cannot even hold a charge.  So it now rests in the garbage can.,2022,03
"Really liked the look/feel/quiet click, but it broke on me after a few days!",2022,03
There was no USB C adapter included.  So it’s essentially useless if you need it for a USB C system.,2022,03
Horrible,2022,03
Unacceptable. 3 days after purchase trackwheel stopped working. Everything else works except that. So frustrating to not have that for easy access.,2022,03
I had to return this because it did not connect and the signal was constantly lost. I finally got my money back after 2 weeks -_-,2022,03
"It’s strange to hold but, it works for it’s intended purpose. It’s not completely silent, but it’s quiet and that’s good enough for me.",2022,03
"Great mouse, sleek and fun.  great price!",2022,03
"Bought to replace older belkin that had no wheel.  I'm trying to learn cad so the wheel is necessary... this Mouse is amazing, i can't believe the cost.  My girlfriend stole it to take to work so I'm ordering another one... very impressed.",2022,03
"It worked great, it would get a little slow when it needed charging but all of a sudden it won't come on even after charging.",2022,03
It was ok while it worked. Prefer battery to having to charge it via USB. Only worked 4 months and the roller mechanism broke.,2022,03
I  LOVED this mouse until the scroll wheel broke a week after the return window. Very disappointed!!,2022,03
I have had this mouse for a while and I have barely used it because the lag is so bad. SO SO SO SO SO BAD. It doesn't follow. It's so slow. It's infuriating. I do graphic work and cannot have a mouse that doesn't act in real time. I do not recommend.,2022,03
It broke within 2 days from  falling off a laptop onto table. I've had other computer mice that fell down the same distance all the way up to down the stairs at worknever had an issue do not reccomend,2022,03
"I bought this because it was rechargeable and for the ergonomic design. After using it for awhile, I plugged it in a charged it. Worked for awhile, then it would only work for a few hours, then not at all. When I plugged it in, I noticed that I had to move the connection (where it plugs into the device) to the left, then it would light up, but if I let go, nothing.  I would not recommend this product!",2022,03
I really love this little mouse as it is easy to use and I can put it in a safe mode so I don't have to keep recharging it and saving on having to buy batteries. My laptop is used primarily for embroidery files so I don't use it for gaming and can't address that.,2022,03
"I just used this mouse for work a few hours a day and it inexplicably stopped turning on when I flipped the switch after just 10 days. I plugged it in to charge like I'd done a few times before and the blue light came on. When the blue light went off I unplugged it and switched it on, but it flashed red a couple of times and wouldn't work. I repeated the process with the same outcome. I know it's a cheap mouse but wow, I got less than one day of use for every dollar I spent.",2022,03
I loved the mouse and it worked great for the first couple of weeks. And then the scroll wheel is no longer working.,2022,03
I needed a mouse that was reliable and easy to use. This was perfect ! Wireless and just plug in and use. Love the different colors. Don’t think twice get this mouse asap !,2022,03
Great purchage & very satified,2022,03
Connects easily & super cute.,2022,03
Very easy to use,2022,03
Perfect fit for my small laptop and its case. and it works great.,2022,03
The slime design makes it easy to transport. the usb piece fits nicely under neither. When it goes into sleep move just click the button and its back up and running!,2022,03
Absolutely loved this mouse. But it stopped working all of the sudden. After reading reviews it seems several others had the same issue. But I guess that's what you get when you purchase something that is only $14. 🤷‍♀️😞,2022,03
It’s very comfortable to use. Minimal noise,2022,03
The mouse is exactly as it appeared. I love the lightness and design. I didn't feel aggrevating symptoms of my carpel tunnel as quickly after use. This enabled me to work longer.,2022,03
Works great! Charge lasts a long time. NO MORE BATTERIES!!!,2022,03
Won’t hold a charge. Haven’t been able to use since I’ve got it cause it won’t turn on after multiple attempts,2022,03
Definitely holds a charge. The day it arrived I put it in charge and it's still going weeks later on a single charge.,2022,03
I brought this mouse for my work computer and it works well,2022,03
The mouse is sleek and cool looking especially with the the colors.  But after a few months. It won't hold charge and the input for the charge cable is loose nd won't try charge unless it held in a certain angle nd pushed it with force,2022,03
"I got tired of using my laptop keyboard and decided rj invest. I love the led colors with the mouse although I rarely change the settings. I love that I don’t have to switch batteries and all I have to do plug it in. I could tell after about a week including me leaving my mouse on a few times that it was time for a charge. My mouse began to lag and I went ahead and plugged it up. Also, the color of the mouse matches with the picture well",2022,03
"In less than 2 months after purchasing, the scrolling wheel stopped working.",2022,03
"It comes clean, mine is dirty because I eat while doing homework. Glows perfectly and comes with a charger and plug in for your computer.",2022,03
"Beware, this mouse did not hold up! It wouldn't charge correctly after a week. Had to return! 😥",2022,03
"Bought this 2 months ago, stopped working yesterday. Tried charging it and using it on different surfaces, nothing. Curser won't budge. Definitely not worth it, now I'm looking for a new one.",2022,03
I like not having to replace batteries all of the time and also the sleek design and color!,2022,03
"It works great with lighting up, clicking, speed.. the scroll doesn’t work to move the screen up and down.",2022,03
"It works okay in the first couple of minutes, and then the cursor starts to jump other than moving smoothly as the mouse moves. Also, clicks often fail to work at the first button down. Sometimes several clicks need to trigger an action. I threw it away and ordered other products.",2022,03
The charge does not last a full day,2022,03
"Well I thought it would be clever to buy two of these and rotate them. However not only do they not maintain a charge WHILE TURNED OFF (I literally have to charge both after one dies, and it's not like these things last that long, so that's pathetic). But also when fully charged and following the troubleshooting, the mouse still will just flash red and not work.I got a 3rd to replace the 2nd, but that one was just as bad. They are all bad. This is a waste of money. You're better off dealing with batteries than these cheap, wasteful electronic items that will just end up in the landfill anyway. Please don't buy, because you will be happy with it right until...the return window closes.",2022,03
"The mouse stopped working after a week of purchase, it did not respond to any movement , I cannot recommend it to someone else, cheap product",2022,03
it was a sleek and nice looking mouse but the usb got annoying and broke easily,2022,03
Did the job,2022,03
This product didn’t/wouldn’t charge,2022,03
The scroll wheel broke after 6 weeks of minimal use.,2022,03
"Great mouse - when it works. Sleek design, good performance. Six week after I got it it stopped working. It is  just few days past the product return deadline. I have written to the manufacturer, lets wait what happens.",2022,03
So easy to use and fits perfectly in my briefcase.,2022,03
The wheel just spins and is not working anymore only 42 days after I purchased it.  Returns are only within 30 days.  I can't afford to buy a new one every 45 days so I'll have to try a different brand and seller.,2022,03
"This mouse was very dissapointing. It was hard to use, and finally after a couple of months it broke completly!",2022,03
Bought this in January and only use it tops two days a week and it stopped working.,2022,03
This product doesn't charge at all,2022,03
Mouse is very pretty aesthetics of it is nice it handles well.  But it broke within a couple days of getting it.  The button stuck. I wouldn’t click anymore.  Unfortunately I liked it so well this was the second one that I ordered and the first one that I ordered the rollerball stopped working but it’s too late to return that one so now I have two broken ones.  The lights on at a really cool the battery lasts really long time in between charging but now I have two of them that have broken and a six week. I think,2022,03
"I bought this two weeks ago and it already does not work. It's is cheaply made, and I am very disappointed.",2022,03
"Not worth it, window to return is small, broke in a month.",2022,03
works,2022,03
Good for its intended purpose. Very light and flimsy but it works so far.,2022,03
It for my laptop doing graphic design,2022,03
"The mouse feels amd looks great,that's the only positive aspect there is this thing cannot even connect to its own hardware so half the time you're just clicking happening this piece of garbage connects.",2022,03
Appearance is a bit different than I was expecting. Also doesn't glide smoothly and quickly enough on the screen not sure why. Sending back after 1 day of use. Swiched to my old bluetooth mouse within hours,2022,03
"When I bought this mouse, I really liked it. It felt nice, worked well on a consistent basis, and the colors give my desk a pretty touch. It was cheap so I guess you can't expect it to last but I was hoping to get at least a year. After 9 months of light daily use, it doesn't want to charge. Even if I leave it plugged in all night, in the morning it barely has any charge. This is a decent mouse if you don't mind having to buy a new one a couple of times a year but I'm going to just spend a little more and get one that is, hopefully, better quality.",2022,03
"It's easy to charge and no batteries required, I really like it",2022,03
I bought this for my son and it dies very fast and it does change colors by itself like it shows on here,2022,03
I have been able to use this product since aug 2021 and then out of the blue the roller wheel stopped working like it disconnected from the internal workings and now wont scroll. This is very disappointing.,2022,03
"I unboxed it, plugged it into my laptop after charging it, and it would not even connect to my computer at all. I'm completely dissatisfied with my time and money with this product. If you're looking for a mouse, this isn't it.",2022,03
"Soft click, it's light weight, cute lights! Love it!",2022,03
It is exactly what I wanted,2022,03
"I've only used this product once and it stopped working after only using it for an hour and a half after being fully charged. It says just two hours of charging can last 7-15 days, but obviously that's a lie. The USB receiver also arrived broken. Don't waste your money on this.",2022,03
"I bought one, it didn't work out of the box.. exchanged it for another, and it lasted for 2.5 months before breaking again. Spend a dollar or two more and another brand!! This one might be the right look, but it will only waist your money..",2022,03
"Very laggy, ended up buying a different one. No matter what I did, I had to reset it every 20 minutes because it was so laggy.",2022,03
Love it,2022,03
It was great for the 2 weeks it lasted. After 2 weeks it would light up as if it was charging but never would hold the charge.,2022,03
"This product was great when I got it. It was RGB, however was expecting to be able to change colors, this part doesn't matter as much as the rest.  Received the Item Jan 27th, 2022, worked up until the morning of 3/14/2022 I used it every day.  Not sure what is going on with it.  As I can flip the power from off to on and the red light flickers, but doesn't come on.",2022,03
"Loved this mouse. But I literally bought it in October and today March 14th it broke. Super sad, was hoping it will last longer",2022,03
Just got it. Seems fine,2022,03
Bought it expecting to be able to use it and it didn’t have the adapter like it is stated!,2022,03
It was great until it stopped working! Won’t even turn on. I charged it of course and still doesn’t work at all. Time window to return passed?! Really???!!! Not what you expect from Amazon. I’ll be taking steps to get my money back you can bet on that. I don’t care how cheap it was!,2022,03
"worked great for the first six months--good tracking, long charge--but the scrolling wheel started acting up shortly after getting it, and now the mouse won't turn on even when plugged directly into the computer. should've paid more for a better quality mouse, that's on me.",2022,03
"I’ve used it 3 times and it was fine and now it will not charge when plugged in, shows red for about 5 seconds and then nothing.  Likes the mouse if it would work. Very disappointed in this product.",2022,03
"It looked fine and worked fine initially, but after three months of careful use, the right button stopped working correctly. It acts now as the button is permanently pressed. I wish I could replace or return, but it isn't possible anymore.",2022,03
Cursor would only work a couple minutes & then freeze up. I love the look & shape but it’s completely useless.,2022,03
"I love this mouse,  it's easy to use.  When I don't use it for a period of time it shuts off and with the click of the mouse its back on. I also love the changing colors.",2022,03
"The mouse is aesthetically very cute, and does feel nice on the hand. Main issue is for both gaming and other computer activities, the mouse will randomly jump across the screen, which has never happened with any other mouse. It's led to misclicks, I've deleted emails I didn't mean to because of it. Essentially just unreliable.",2022,03
An absolutely great choice for office work.,2022,03
"Great value, Comfortable and stylish little mouse+",2022,03
Broken and flimsy on arrival,2022,03
Scroll function randomly stopped working 2 months after buying. Can no longer return/replace,2022,03
It's a very practical mouse you color is pretty.,2022,03
So I have had this mouse for about 4 weeks and It works perfectly I never encountered the problems people had with it stopping and people say that the battery dies too quickly which I have been using on the same battery without charging it for 3 days. My cursor has also never messed up it works just fine. The only problem I have with this device is the lighting is not nearly as impressive as I thought it would be but I guess that's what you get for buying a mouse for 11$,2022,03
Easy to charge and to use.,2022,03
NOT WORKING AFTER 2 months of use,2022,03
"This mouse is great! I've been using it for a month now and really love it. I was a little unsure about the lack of battery power, but the charge holds for a long time. I've only had to charge it once with daily use. Highly recommend!",2022,03
Great mouse! Works just as described Unfortunately the charging cable didn't work Thank goodness we have extras Great purchase tho!,2022,03
It’s goes on sleep more by it self so the battery last long.,2022,03
I love the colors of the led lights and it works great!,2022,03
Had it two months and it’s already dead. What a piece of junk. So glad it quit working right after the return window closed. Quit scrolling and moving the cursor on the screen. Cheap piece of garbage.,2022,03
"Good product, exceded my expectations",2022,03
"I really like this mouse. It's small and slim, so it doesn't make my wrist sit at a weird angle. It also has a good battery life. I think I've only charged it like once since I bought it several months ago. It's pretty responsive and light, and overall, it's great quality for the money. It does feel a little cheap and fragile because of how light it is, but that doesn't bother me at all.",2022,03
Very slick.,2022,03
Took a chance and ordered this for at the office. Wanted something a little more comfortable and without a cord. Excellent choice love love love this mouse and the charge staying power is amazing,2022,03
This came out of the box not working. Description and reviews are very misleading. Very cheap and glitchy.,2022,03
Just bought this mouse and was really excited to use it but even after charging for multiple hours the mouse will turn on briefly and then immediately stop functioning. Just goes to show that items this cheap often are too good to be true. Save your money and buy a better mouse.,2022,03
"It was great while it worked with the first one that I got. Then it started not working and I messaged the sellers and they send me another one. Tell me how the new one didn't work at Alllll, such a terrible product don't waste your money or your time trying to make it work.",2022,03
I have this mouse for 29 days and now it just doesn’t charge…no idea why and I’ve tried everything. DO NOT BUY. It’s cheap.,2022,03
This mouse is very stylish and ergonomic! It is very responsive. I love it!,2022,03
The thing is just laggy and terrible and you stop using it because it's so frustrating. Junk.,2022,03
Stopped working after a couple of weeks,2022,03
Stopped Working After Two or so months of having it.,2022,03
"After having this mouse for 2 weeks, it stopped working. Computer doesn't recognize the usb and wont pair with it wirelessly. This is the replacement for the original one that broke after being dropped a short distance. No way of contacting the seller.  Very disappointed",2022,03
I use it a lot. Had for over a month. No issues. I have gold and it’s cute. Very easy to maneuver.,2022,03
"Works great, very reactive, colors look fantastic while they go through all the different colors. As well as has an option for just red if you’re not feeling fancy",2022,03
stop working the wheel just stopped working just rolled and rolled,2022,03
I liked the way it fit my hand.,2022,03
"Bought this mouse in January and fully charged it the same day i got it. Until this day, as I am writing this review I haven't recharge it not once. I must say I use it a fair amount of time, not to full extent everday but i do use it. I really like the sleep mode, that preserve the battery a whole lot because sometimes i just get up leave it and go out on the road, spend a few hours and come back and it's still here doing great.I feel pretty satisfied, with what I payed for this I didn't expect it to hold up like this but I give thanks...Five stars for this...",2022,03
I love how fast it connects and how cute it looks,2022,03
Nice little mouse that lasts a while on one charge. I love not having to replace batteries!,2022,03
"Broke within 3 days, didn't think of returning it, just threw in the garbage.",2022,03
" This product is not worth the headache. The first mouse stopped scrolling after 2 weeks of use. I returned it and 2 days after using the new mouse I am returning it and requesting a refund.  The mouse doesn't hold a charge because there is a red light around the whole mouse that is always on, EVEN WHEN SWITCHED OFF. The previous mouse wasn't like this and worked well until it stopped scrolling. Now I have to go to a second location to return the mouse again. They should reimburse the gas I've used returning this mouse. I probably spent more in gas than what I paid for the mouse.As you can see in the video, it is off but the light is on. I turn it off and the light on. I then turn it off again and the light doesn't turn off.",2022,03
"Love using this mouse. The LED lights are fascinating and fun. So easy on the hand and wrist no pressure, no numbness or tingling and my hand doesn't get tired and achy. Have carpal tunnel so love the relief I get now and know that will be really helpful and appreciated after my surgery.",2022,03
Home PC,2022,03
Will not hook up to my laptop,2022,03
"Good value for the $. Looks good, quiet buttons, fancy light up feature, no batteries to replace.",2022,03
Stopped charging after 6 months. Poor quality.,2022,03
Doesn’t hold a charge used it as a mouse for my laptop charged it once and it stopped working,2022,03
It is a little slippery in the hand but I have been using a PC mouse....,2022,03
"I've had this less than a year.  It's been wonderful but is starting to get skippy & glitchy to where it's unusable.  It's a shame, it's a nice, colorful, quiet mouse but evidently not made very well.",2022,03
I just got a new all in 1 computer amd needed a new mouse to bring some life to my conpletely white computer. I love the different colors it lights up. I also love the feel of the mouse and the size is perfect. I would recommend this mouse. It's affordable.,2022,03
i really enjoyed this mouse that arrived so promptly. After my first few clicks i realized it is the best mouse i had ever used for regular writing needs. The design /color is very stylish too.,2022,03
Works perfect.  Smooth no issues.  Battery last forever,2022,03
I was excited for this mouse and it worked well up until now. I’ve only had this mouse for two months. Already stopped working and I’ve only used it 4 times. Don’t recommend buying. Too late to get my refund and that sucks!,2022,03
"Works great, don't have to buy batteries, plug it in and charge it!",2022,03
I don’t like it,2022,03
I had this mouse for two weeks and then it just stopped working which is so sad because it’s so cute,2022,03
"The battery doesn’t even last one day! I pretty much have to keep it plugged in at all times and I have the light setting turned off. It looks like a nice mouse and the wheel and clicking is fine, but what’s the point if it’s never charged?! Don’t waste your money on this mouse.",2022,03
"I bought this in November and it stopped working in January. It also feels cheaply made, I should’ve know this. It does not charge. I’ve charge it for a long time multiple times, it barely turned on before it died again. Piece of garbage!",2022,03
I don't know about gaming but for everything else it works great.,2022,03
"After receiving this mouse, I charged the mouse per the instructions on a normal rate USB charger (non fast charger). This took a little under two hours for a full charge. The blue light goes out when fully charged.I installed the USB receiver into my computer and the mouse was recognized immediately on Windows 11. The mouse seems to work smoothly, and the mouse pointer is swift. You can adjust pointer speeds if it is too fast. The mouse lights up around the sides when in use, it is a bit quirky but it doesn't bother me. Also the mouse will go to sleep if not used for a certain period of time, probably to prolong the battery charge. To wake the mouse I just move it or press a button.Overall it is a decent wireless/rechargeable mouse.",2022,03
Ergonomic,2022,03
Sux. stopped working after a month of use.  will not charge.,2022,03
Scroll wheel broke after very light use.  Would not recommend.  Would have been a nice mouse otherwise.,2022,03
"Bought this to replace my old Apple mouse.  It works well, holds a charge, easy to recharge - no problems.  It did take a little relearning to use the ""wheel"" vs the Apple mouse smooth glide system.  Great price too!",2022,03
This worked great for the first 9 months and then it didn't work at all. I didn't use it daily. Sent an email to the one provided and never got a response.,2022,02
"Love the mouse itself, however, charging wire is too short",2022,02
Does the job !,2022,02
This came all scratched up and feels very cheap.,2022,02
"This mouse changes colors so tweens would get a kick out of it. I love the sleep mode, as it saves energy. I purchased the gold mouse and its very classy looking. I like the fact no battery is required and I've only had to charge once in a 30-day period.",2022,02
"Beautiful and ergonomic, the only thing I would say is the battery doesn't last longer, but in general it's a great product",2022,02
"It was a wonderful mouse when it arrived. However, it quit working.",2022,02
Stopped working shortly after can’t get a refund or exchange,2022,02
It’s very cute but it lags and skips around a lot unfortunately!,2022,02
"Doesn't charge fast, the scroll broke within days, the mouse completely stopped working after a few weeks. It constantly would stick-",2022,02
Mouse stop working after a couple of days.  Feel cheap.  Got what I paid for.Always felt like I was holding the wrong end of the mouse.,2022,02
The charge doesn't last very long so basically its a wired mouse cuz its charging all the time. So disappointing.,2022,02
The mouse stopped taking charge from the charger after 6 months,2022,02
Stoped working after a few weeks. It won’t charge.,2022,02
It doesn’t stay charged and it feels too light weight in your hand.,2022,02
It works for now. Will see after some time….,2022,02
Great product that is a snap to setup and use. Plug it in and charge it and plug the receiver into your system and your good to go. It fits my hand perfectly and is easy to use.,2022,02
"Bought this on January 12, and on March 2 the scroller wheel stopped working. No way to fix it, so the mouse is useless now.",2022,02
Absolutely beautiful and sleek….never worked. I charged it until it indicated it was fully charged but it never worked.,2022,02
"I really wanted to love this mouse, but it is TERRIBLE. The scroll hardly works, and yes I tried multiple mousepads. Add to that the inability to CLICK (a core functionality of a computer mouse...) and the whole thing is a piece of crappy light up plastic. 0/10",2022,02
Feels and looks cheaply made. Not to mention it broke in less then a week!,2022,02
"The wife needed a new mouse. I found this one, she said she liked it, I ordered it, she loves it. Very sleek, works perfectly, USB charging instead of batteries... awesome!",2022,02
It turned on and that is about all it did. It wouldn't move the cursor. I tried different mouse pads and surfaces and finally gave up.,2022,02
"the wheel broke after a little over a month. I am not on my laptop too much, so I don't understand it! I haven't even had to recharge it after the first initial charge. It's a great big nope for me.",2022,02
"I bought this because I’m trying to minimize the amount of wires on my desk and because the color matches my pc case but it’s not worth it. The mouse barely works and it takes forever to get it to actually click on what you want, like it’s pretty and the colors are cute but those are the only good things about this. Thankfully I play with a controller so it doesn’t hinder my gaming but if you do play mouse and keyboard absolutely don’t get this.",2022,02
 Its really great I don't use it for gaming if you are looking for that review stop here but for other review keeping reading. It changes color on its own you can't personally change it that's a bummer. It slowly changes color one thing that bothers me is the default red light. When you move it the red light appears and it over powers the other changing colors. If your fine with the red light then buy it. Other than that it does its job really pretty too. The mouse is a matte black so its not shiny just wanted to mention that.,2022,02
it became sluggish and wasnt working properly with my mac after a month or so.,2022,02
"Love this product! Works great for work. It is nice it’s rechargeable, and the charge lasts a while.",2022,02
Worked good for a week. Cheap and doesn't work anymore. I tried to change battery but can't open it. And if it opens I can't figure it out. Order something else. Not this one. I did love the light on it.,2022,02
Not so comfortable on hand comparing to ​Microsoft mouse and the refresh rate seems inferior. The only superiority is it's design. For home purposes it is ok. It have very quit click,2022,02
Poor battery life. Need to. Charge  daily,2022,02
"Nice quality,  beautiful cards.",2022,02
"I knew what I was getting myself into reading the bad reviews; it stops working in a few weeks. Usually, I hedge my bets especially when a product has so many reviews that end up with a 4.5 star rating. Alas, I lost this bet. The scroll function, a key feature I look for in buying mice, stopped responding after a a few weeks. A fluke? I should buy a scratcher if so because I bought two, one white, one black, and they both failed around the same time.I’m wondering if this is actually engineered to perform this way, though, as I’m seeing many other reviews doing the same thing, but people being bribed for a 5 star, if replaced. Quite genius, actually. If you get angry customers to review, it promotes product engagement, but then the rating can be manipulated by replacing the cheap product and soliciting a 4-5 star review. If this indeed is the case, BRAVO. Brilliant way to get as many positive reviews for a subpar product.",2022,02
Scroll wheel broke after one day. Only used for less than an hour and it no longer scrolls and isn’t connected in the correct position anymore. Very light use. Hopefully replacement will be better quality. If I remember I’ll update review after using replacement.,2022,02
"I absolutely love this mouse.  First off I have to say my cat has knocked this done off the table multiple times and it still works.  That is huge with me.  Next it's a very nice mouse.  I love the colors it lights up with.  Its so nice to not have to worry about a battery too, just plug in and charge and ready to go.  I swear I charge it like once a month too and it still works great.  I highly recommend this mouse.",2022,02
 Great for the price! Very small but fits hand perfectly,2022,02
"I really liked that it was easy to set up. I really disliked the instructions, which left much to be desired. Once I figured out the problem myself setup was easy and seamless. I really like the way it looks and the ease of operation. It’s only been in use for one day so I guess I will keep hoping that it works as well over time.",2022,02
It stopped working after falling on the floor.,2022,02
"I love this mouse. I wish it did come with a battery option, but I still love it!",2022,02
"I like the idea of the rechargeable battery.  However, the charge of the battery does not last very long.  I will continue to use the mouse but intend to buy another for use when this one is being charged which is very often.",2022,02
 Let me start off this review by saying I was very excited to get this mouse because it matched my desk my bedroom and my laptop perfectly I absolutely loved the mouse right up until two weeks of having it and it completely stopped working. Don’t waste your money not worth it.,2022,02
Thinnest mouse i have ever seen.,2022,02
Is not USB C. It works well but plastic feels cheap and flymsy.,2022,02
I am very disappointed with the quality of life this mouse has. I bought it and was only able to use it four or five times and it has been a problem for me ever since. I’ve charged it adequately and it won’t start. I’m not sure if its a factory malfunction or not but it should still be working. I’ve owned it for a little over a month now.,2022,02
Love it,2022,02
 Mouse stopped working… i had it worked for a couple of days 🙄🙄🙄,2022,02
Nice,2022,02
I have had for a month and the roller broke. What a bummer.,2022,02
Sleep mode helps the charge last longer and it's great for the wrist!,2022,02
Good thing it's rechargeable because otherwise your changing batteries everyday instead of just plugging it in.,2022,02
"I ordered 2, 1 for work and 1for home. They are great until 1 died after 2 months. It indicated that it is charged but it does not function. It might be a bad switch?  They second died in less than 9 months of use. Disposable batteries would be better for the environment than disposing of multiple rechargeable that stop working faster than a battery runs out.",2022,02
Battery doesn’t last long. Maybe 48 hrs at a time?,2022,02
The mouse does not work.  Very disappointed.  It freezes on the screen.,2022,02
I was looking for a simple black LED mouse for work and this one is exactly what I was looking for. It works great and I have had no issues yet. Due to the size it can be a little uncomfortable if you are doing a lot of work using the mouse for an extended amount of time but this has only happened to me once.,2022,02
"works very well charges good , love it",2022,02
"The rest of the mouse is fine but the scroll wheel no longer scrolls - took just over 1 month for it to break, so I can't even return it now.",2022,02
all good,2022,02
Item does not work,2022,02
" The wireless mouse was great in the beginning, weeks later it wouldn’t keep a charge, when it did charge it would only work if it was hooked up to the charger on my laptop (meaning I still couldn’t use it) then I would unplug it and lights started going crazy!So I would turn the switch off and on to try and use it, epic FAIL!A waste of my hard working money!Then they only give you a certain amount of time to return, so basically it’s a total loss!",2022,02
Dont buy stopped working after 5 weeks,2022,02
It functions according to my expectation.,2022,02
"The lights are entertaining, it works well, and it survived the delivery driver squashing the package",2022,02
I should've listened others' review. I read but i thought it might be some specific situation. But my! the bluetooth don't work at all and now i have to trouble myself with all the returning work.,2022,02
IT QUIT WORKING!!! IT'S DEAD ER THAN DOOR KNOB!!!@,2022,02
 Love it. Love rose gold so this was perfect. You can have the lights like I did or just solid color or off. It is wireless and comes with a charger. And I love the quite clicks,2022,02
It stop working within 6 weeks.,2022,02
We were using an Amazon basic mouse and after a couple years it broke. We upgraded to this mouse and my teenage son loves it! He uses it at school with his laptop and loves how the colors light up under it.,2022,02
You won't hear the annoying clicking sound from this mouse.,2022,02
Bought it in September. Stopped working after a few days.  They sent me a replacement. Now it's February and it's totally died. I'm so sad. I use it at work.,2022,02
This is the best mouse I've used in a long time. I've bought them for my kids and my friends and I have back ups so when one is charging I always have one,2022,02
"I like the product and the idea - too bad that once the charge goes, it stops working.  I figured the first one was a lemon so got a replacement but same issue.  No idea why but just works for like a week and then dies.",2022,02
 Haven’t had this mouse for more than a week and the left click is already broken. It won’t snap back into place. I loved the mouse in the beginning which made me order a replacement. Hopefully this one doesn’t let me down.,2022,02
"Now that I'm an old man and don't need anything super fancy for my desktop, I replaced a Deathadder from 2010 with it.  Only been using it for about 10 hours, but no major complaints so far.  Takes a little bit of getting use to because it's sits so low, but the clicks feel nice and seems fairly responsive.",2022,02
Really smooth soft click I liked 👍,2022,02
"Easy to use, only took a couple hours to first charge. Looks cute !",2022,02
 Cute. Colorful. Small. Lightweight. Quiet/soft clicks. Easy quick set up.,2022,02
"I liked this mouse when it worked, but the scroll real broke within a couple weeks.",2022,02
For the price I realized I could have gotten something a lot better. It’s cheaply made. Glitches even with a full charge. I got the white one and I wish I would have read the reviews before hand because it does indeed show the whole internal lighting unit which just adds the the cheapness of it. It does the job still all considering I just think it’s value is overestimated.,2022,02
Scrolling wheel went lose (broke) less than a week after purchase.,2022,02
This product stopped working after a month and of course I am outside of my return window,2022,02
Was a little squirrely to use,2022,02
Love this mouse works great and great price,2022,02
I love this mouse. I love the led colored lights the most. Another one of my favorite is that it is magnetic and sticks to my laptop when I’m in the car or at the local coffee shop.,2022,02
I fell in love with the color changing of this product but it kept cutting off and sticking. I had to return it,2022,02
Love the feel of it with my hand and the fact it doesn't need to be charged every week.  I went over a week and a half before I had to charge it.,2022,02
This mouse was a waste of money it broke after using it one month. I bought another mouse a couple weeks ago and it will not charge. I do not recommend this mouse.,2022,02
Multi use can use this mouse for anything you need to get done. Smooth slick and overall perfect performance.,2022,02
Stoped working after a week,2022,02
This item did not work from the very beginning. I sent it back. Will not purchase from this company again.,2022,02
"I needed a mouse for my laptop and so I bought this! The set up was really easy. Simply charge the mouse, plug in the USB and done! The silent clicks are indeed quiet but I wouldn’t say they’re completely inaudible, but that’s totally okay with me! When the mouse charges, it turns blue and when it’s done charging, the light will switch off. When I turn on the mouse to the color mode, the colors fade nicely to the next. The only nitpick for me is that I wish the white part of the top of the mouse was more opaque so that the backlit colors don’t peek through it. But it’s personal preference. I also like how it came with a USB to USBC adapter just in case it needs to be used for a Mac. Overall, a great mouse!",2022,02
"Works really well, plus it looks nice! Great price, too!",2022,02
Had a bit of an issue but the customer service was fantastic and corrected it FAST!  ★★★★★,2022,02
Doesn’t hold charge long,2022,02
It was perfect until the wheel stopped working before 6 months of use,2022,02
Great Price and service,2022,02
"Never buy this product!!!When I buy something, I usually look at product reviews, but this product seems to have a lot of problems, unlike reviews. I don't usually post reviews, but I'm posting this product review in hopes that there won't be victims like me. I bought a mouse and it worked fine at first. But after charging it, it started to get weird and didn't work at all. So I thought there might be a small problem, so I exchanged the new one instead of a refund. Received a new mouse and it worked fine for another few days. But after charging it again, it didn't work. The product user manual says it is sensitive to charging, but this is a serious problem. I bought this product for the convenience of not using the battery or wire, but I think it makes no sense to not work because of the charging prolem.",2022,02
I bought this for my nephew and unfortunately he told me that its just all over the place on his chromebook screen..doesn't go where you need it to go etc,2022,02
Randomly moves the cursor to the top left. Definitely a 1/5 for gaming.,2022,02
"Nice feel and looks nice, but the scroll wheel works on and off making more advanced tasks difficult.",2022,02
Love it! The rose gold color is so cute and it’s lightweight! Loves the light change. Works great for me!,2022,02
"I recently got a job working from home and needed a mouse to accompany. I purchased the rose gold, it is beautiful, came on time, and hooked up with no issues. If you want to use the color changing lights, make sure to flip the switch on the bottom of the mouse all the way to the sunshine symbol, took me a few to figure that out, but otherwise great product!!",2022,02
It's quiet and cute. I love all the colors and the battery last a long time,2022,02
Battery life has been great so far. It goes to sleep mode when not in use but there’s also on/off function. I love that you can charge it also - I just plug it in once every few days overnight.,2022,02
"Bought this twice because it matched my keyboard, both times it broke within a month.I used it lightly throughout the day too",2022,02
 bought this mouse read direction simple and easy plug in to phone charger for 2 hrs then unplug mouse will turn blue say it need to be charged 2 hrs then it will turn red then go to mouse plug in the usb port in to windows 10 computer then turn button on mouse underneath to on then try mouse out to see if it moves on computer i give this 5 out of 5 stars dont give in to bad reviws people post bad reviews and never reads instruction first,2022,02
"Love it. Came with the mouse itself , white cable , black usbc adapter . The white little adapter underneath the mouse easily connected to the  black usb that I used for my MacBook to usbc . The white small cable I believe to charge it. You can easily turn off the lights but they look really nice on. mouse is thin but comfortable! Although I order the silver to match my laptop it is not the exact same but close just a bit darker.",2022,02
It's 4 days past the return deadline and this item is not working any longer. Wow,2022,02
"The scroll wheel broke after a month or two. Have to buy another mouse, wont buy this again.It's a good size to save space  but it doesnt fit the hand well.",2022,02
Poor quality. Does not hold charge.  Has a sleek design but mouse does not work as intended.,2022,02
"Its very quite, you can work without that horrendous clicking sound of a regular mouse. You will love this device.",2022,02
got it broken. The scroll works but nothing else works. Asked to get a new mouse but I have to go somewhere to return it which I don’t have time for.,2022,02
"I loved this mouse...for the literal two weeks (14 days) that I had it and it was working.  For no apparent reason, the scroll wheel just suddenly stopped working, approximately five seconds after I had last used it.  I had not subjected it to  any pressure, or abuse of any sort.  I was looking at a document, scrolled down, continued reading, tried to scroll down and...nope.  In the lower ratings, this seems to be a common problem.  I'm bummed, I really did love the mouse. :(",2022,02
It is really great. It don't need charge for days then finally dead on me. I love it. Really cute and colorful. I use lots. I use with my MacBook Pro.,2022,02
loved this mouse until it stopped working several months after purchase. It will no longer charge and I cannot use it. Very disappointed.,2022,02
Very frustrating as they both broke on the same day about 1 month after purchase and too late to return.,2022,02
Long lasting power recharges fast,2022,02
"This mouse didn't last a month. The buttons broke and the seller will not replace it. Waste of money, DO NOT BUY",2022,02
"The wireless mouse worked well in the begining. It was small but it fit in my hand well and the lights were a nice, though not necessary, feature. I received it in September. It wasnt something I used every day, about once or twice a week. In February the scroll wheel just broke. It spins loosely and no longer scrolls on the screen. I do not use it often and I am definitely not rough on it.  I am dissapointed in the quality of this product.",2022,02
"The mouse looks great, feels great, but I didn't get more than a few hours out of it before it died.  I left it plugged in for several hours but it doesn't stay on anymore.  Despite several recharge attempts, it just doesn't turn on anymore.",2022,02
"This was a good mouse I got as a gift and I really liked it until it didn’t work anymore! After a while it stoped working and I looked at some other reviews that said they got a defective one, well I guess I did and they are kinda common to be defective so I would only risk buying it if you want the mouse a decent amount. I would say you’re chance of it being broken is like a 3/10. Also, it only stops working after like 4/5 days so you won’t know until then if you buy it…  Also I did like that they added a usb-c adapter in the box. I use they adapter for something else now.",2022,02
To slow. Don’t buy,2022,02
"Nice mouse, the battery lasts along time before needing recharged and I like that I do not have to use a mousepad with it as it works great even without one.",2022,02
The color and shape are very nice but the mouse and the packaging arrived very dirty. The scroll wheel on the mouse is made from a cheap rubbery/silicone material and is completely crooked. It also did not have a good feel when testing it out - not smooth and feels like it take a lot of extra pressure to operate than others. Not sure if this is due to it being crooked or not but either way this will be returned.,2022,02
The wheel was broken the second day I used it,2022,02
I love the color (rose gold) and it works great on a variety of surfaces. I just wish it would alert me when the battery is low so I can charge it before I need it for work.,2022,02
I like it,2022,02
It was working fine. I busted it maybe 6 times max and it stopped workingIt looks to be charging but isn’t.  When placed into on mode the red light flashes and goes off right away.,2022,02
"I really liked this mouse, but I had to return the first one because the wheel quite scrolling after it was knocked off my bed onto a carpeted soft bedroom floor. No big deal, they sent me a new one and I sent the malfunctioning one back. Well, the wheel has quit on this 2nd one too, once bitten and twice shy and all that.  I'll be returning this one as well & then be off to find a wireless mouse that's not so 'sensitive' and will last longer than a month. It really sinks, I liked this mouse a lot.",2022,02
I purchased this back in October but didn’t open it until 02/14 when my new computer finally came in. I used it for one day and it worked great and now won’t charge at all or even turn on when plugged in. Instructions say you can use it while charging but won’t even do that. Guess I should have tested it out when I first purchased it! Won’t be buying another one!!,2022,02
Bought in December stopped working in February.,2022,02
 Less thank a month later the part that goes into the computer has broken,2022,02
This mouse is gorgeous! It is so quiet and feels great in my hand. It synced with my laptop with ease. I do feel the charge doesn't last as long as I'd like but you can use it while it's charging which is nice. Definitely recommend :),2022,02
"Item came fast. Easy to set up and use. Love that it is rechargeable and you don't have to worry about constantly replacing the batteries. I use this at work. I plug it in at night to charge and it lasts all day while I work, with no issues. Would recommend this item.",2022,02
"came quickly, easy to set up...Delivery person put in spot close to door and knocked to let me know it was there, door bell not working, and he was wearing his  mask",2022,02
Is DEAD. Will not hold a charge. Cheap but not worth what I paid.,2022,02
"I ordered 2 of these for our new MacBook computers we got for ChristmasMy granddaughters broke after only a couple of uses, mine I finally tried setting up last week after being on Holiday and it doesn’t even work.Return windows are closed so they will make its way to trashDonNOT but this items, they are cheap and a waste!!",2022,02
I thought I had to keep charging this. I work 10 hour days and it hasn't died on me yet. Charged it 1 time in a week.,2022,02
"Simple, sleek, quiet and most of all, it has a USB C adapter for my MacBook Air.  The low profile design is ideal to be a carry around mouse if I need to bring one.I've used a lot of wireless mouse and this by far is the best.",2022,02
Doesn't work at all. I am tired of charging it and nothing happens. Wasted my money.,2022,02
Scroll wheel broke within a few weeks of use.,2022,02
"Really like the quietness of the clicks.  Flatter than most mice; took a little bit of getting used to but fine now.  Will be easy to travel with.  Very responsive.  Charges by USB and lasts for several days; no need to have extra batteries.  LED lights are fun, but hard to see in bright light.  I'm looking at the screen when I'm using the mouse (who doesn't?) so I don't really see the lights that much.",2022,02
I'm not the only person it seems. It works for some and not others. I don't know. Works fine with other computers i've plugged it into. Just don't buy it for a macbook.,2022,02
I U. could not pair the mouse to my MacBook Air. I really don't know why.,2022,02
USB receiver broke inside my son’s computer when he tried pulling it out. The reason he tried pulling it out was because the mouse wasn’t responding. This happened on the 1st time ever trying to pull it out. He had to use tweezer to take out the broken piece. Now none of it is working.,2022,02
"The “matte coating” started peeling off within a week or two of using it.  It still works well, but looks terrible.",2022,02
Worked well for a while but then stopped working completely after 6 months. It would charge but not turn on.,2022,02
Product quit working after return window of one month closed,2022,02
"This mouse looks good, but that's it. It works poorly. I finally gave up and went back to my old wired mouse. It just doesn't work well. You end up wildly moving it around and getting the cursor to where you want it to click on something is a struggle.  Would not recommend this mouse.",2022,02
"This mouse has met all of my requirements. When my old wireless mouse began to die, I opted for this rechargeable one because I was sick of batteries. This has a very long battery life, as I use it for up to 8 hours in a row. I use it for gaming (League of Legends) and it works perfectly (no lag), and it's crazy cute to boot with all of it's colours and such. Haven't had it very long, about a month and a half but very happy with it so far.",2022,02
Does it exactly what it should do.,2022,02
For the price it’s great.  It’s not too silent on the clicking but it’s ok I still love it.,2022,02
I tried charging this mouse but every time I take it off the charger it goes off. This was the first time even using it too.,2022,02
Fully charged it still started cutting out within an hour of use and now doesn't connect at all.,2022,02
"This mouse never worked. I charged it fully before first use, tried it on 4 different devices. Never worked....it turns on, the LED is nice, but it won't move or click. Will be requesting a refund. Don't get this. Not worth the hassle nor the price. This is a $2 P.O.S.",2022,02
"It sure looks nice, but there's no patch/fix/update to make this compatible with the new OS.  Boo hiss.",2022,02
The mouse cursor jumps around and doesn't stay where it's supposed to.,2022,02
I loved it until it stopped working today,2022,02
My daughter got this mouse for Christmas. After only 6 weeks the USB receiver broke and today the scroll wheel. Prior to this she said it was working well and she really liked the feel. Too bad the quality is crap.,2022,02
product never worked. defective,2022,02
Work great like the lights,2022,02
Fast shipping and works great,2022,02
"This mouse was pretty great when I first got it. Worked well, went quite a while without needing to charge, quiet, etc. However, 8 months later, it's acting up almost constantly. It skips around the screen and sometimes turns itself off like there's an electrical short somewhere. Obviously too late to return, but I wanted to update my rating. This wasn't expensive, but it shouldn't act like it's disposable.",2022,02
I loved this mouse! I received it and was able to unbox and set it up within 30 seconds! It charges so quickly and its a perfect size. I love it.,2022,02
"I use this mouse when I travel. It is great to haul around when on the go. The small form lets it easily slip in to my backpack and the dongle holder on the mouse makes the set up and tear down quick and easy.If you are looking for a mouse to use for light work while on the road, this is a good choice!",2022,02
It worked the two minutes it stayed charged. I left it charging for an hour and used it a total of two minutes before it completely died again. Left it charging 4 hours and it did the same thing. Waste of money.,2022,02
This mouse works perfectly for my MacBook. I enjoy the color changing effect. Lots of fun to use. Feels good in your hand.,2022,02
I got the USB receiver but no mouse in the box.???,2022,02
 I love that the colors change! It’s perfect. I haven’t even had to charge it since I got it!,2022,02
"Fully charged - I would work with the mouse for 1/2 hour - 45-minutes - and then it would lag and hardly move or not move at all. Fully charged - I kept having to switch USB ports to get it working again - which worked sometimes...but then it again would get stuck, lag, or stop working. I have the latest MAC/software - what I don't have is time for this mouse. I returned it. I bought another wireless USB mouse from another company that works perfectly.",2022,02
Loved this but based on other reviews I'm not the only one with this issue. Stopped recharging and working after 5 months.,2022,02
This mouse is very light weight and the added colors make it super cool. It also holds a charge for a very long time which is helpful! Really great product for the price!,2022,02
"I love this wireless mouse. The lights are great and easy to assemble. If you need a wireless mouse for your laptop, get this.",2022,02
The mouse is well built and works as intended. The LED lighting is pretty cool. A step above the daily dull plain mice out there.,2022,02
This mouse quit working just one day past the return date and now I am stuckusing this mouse as a doorstop.Take my advice and purchase anything but this one.,2022,02
I bought this to replace another that I had used from august to December. I replaced the first one due to the spinner breaking. I was hoping that the new one would last longer but it only lasted 3 weeks. Completely disappointed in it.,2022,02
The mouse worked for less then a day. I bought it for school so I could edit thing and it stopped working within 20 minutes even after being charged the night before. Don't buy this product its a waste of money.,2022,02
Had this for a month and it’s already dead. Doesn’t charge and tried multiple usb cables. Would highly not recommend this or any no name products they are similar,2022,02
"I bought this product in November, by December the axle for the mouse wheel had snapped. I’ll admit I liked the size and look of it enough to buy it again….here we are in February and the same exact thing has happened again. I used this mouse for my work computer in the office, and certainly don’t aggressively use the scroll wheel. Yet the same axle has snapped on two of these units, both within the first 6 weeks of use. I’ve never had a mouse break apart like this before, so I have to conclude that this is just utterly cheap in the way it is made and the parts holding it together. I suppose you get what you pay for, a shame because aesthetically it is very nice.I will never buy this product again, I would advise anyone else to save your money and stay away. Pay a few extra dollars and find something that lasts more than a few weeks.Side note: I look forward to having the seller reach out to me to take down my review (rolls eyes). Perhaps I’ll just copy and paste their request here for the rest of you to read ha",2022,02
Do yourself a favor and do not buy this low quality mouse.,2022,02
Product does not work well. Don’t waste your money.,2022,02
I got this for my laptop and it does not work very well. It skips or just does not move at all. I gave it to my grandson thinking that since it says it for gaming that maybe it would work better for him but he does not like it at all. He says the feel of it is off and it does not stay connected.,2022,02
"You can't really beat the price, it's actually a little nicer than I was anticipating given what I paid. I would say it's worth the price, I just this with my chromebook for my online classes. The light is really cute too.",2022,02
"Purchased this for our laptop, daughter loves it! Colors are great!  Works good",2022,02
"I originally bought this mouse for my gaming PC and it works great it's smooth and easy to use without a wire. I would also recommend people get a pretty big mouse pad so you have room to move, it makes everything better",2022,02
I purchased this mouse for my new MacBook Pro. It is so much better than the Apple Magic Mouse I was using with my iMac. This mouse fits perfectly in my hand and is easy to maneuver. The adapter for the USB-C port on my Mac works and fits perfectly. I am extremely happy with my purchase. The mouse also is rechargeable which will save me money as I will not be purchasing AAA batteries anymore!I highly recommend this product. The quality and appearance of this mouse make it seem like a much more expensive product! 5 stars!!!!,2022,02
Of left unattended for a while....sleep mode works fantastic. Also great for gaming.,2022,02
I used this product once and tried to use it for my work laptop and the USB broke inside the laptop. I can’t get it out. DONT BUY THIS. It’s CHEAPLY made,2022,02
I bought one of these and liked it so much that I got one for both of my daughters also.,2022,02
"This wireless does not use batteries, you charge with your laptop when needed. There is light that changes color and it's pretty cool.",2022,02
Love the sensitivity settingThe battery lasts a long time between charges,2022,02
"I would have loved this product if my hands weren’t so picky, and plus it was a bit too flat for gaming on a pc. Works fine very silent clicks, still if you aren’t used to a flat mouse don’t buy it",2022,01
I liked the unit until it stopped functioning.,2022,01
"PROS- wireless ease of use- feels nice: soft, smooth, sleek- dampened click, quietCONS**- It has a very loud scroll button - the wheel works fine, but the button is difficult to press down and is quite loud, so it slightly defeats the purpose of a quiet mouse.- no additional buttons such as ""back"" or ""forward""ADDITIONAL- you have to charge the mouse with the included USB charger",2022,01
Stopped working already!,2022,01
I never had a wireless mouse before and wow! I’m blown away that the chord had been cut and I’m free to have total control from such a great distance. Great ergonomic design and also has lights that flash and I can charge it with no more batteries! I love this mouse🐹,2022,01
It is somehow ok,2022,01
My 16 year old daughter loves it! Got it to go with her new Chromebook for school. Definitely love the brand products I'm seeing.,2022,01
"Broke already, won't charge & can't return. Stay away from this mouse!",2021,11
"Had it for only one day until I accidentally dropped it from less than a meter, and the stroller wheel broke. I could fix it with superglue but come on, I shouldn't have to do that. It was cheaply made and it literately broke day 1. If you're thinking of buying this don't let me stop you from trying it, just don't drop it.",2022,01
This lags so bad. NOT great,2022,01
"I don’t even use it full shift, and already broke, very disappointed.",2022,01
I love it. The battery last a decente amount of time,2022,01
"I had this mouse for about a week, I use it for work and once it died i used the cable it came with to charge it. I left it plugged in for a few hours and now it wont turn on at all. It flashes red and turns off. Waste of money",2022,01
Nice look to it,2022,01
came missing USB receiver.,2022,01
"It was working fine, until the mouse wheel broke three weeks in. Now useless.",2022,01
"This mouse doesn't work. It may go a few days of being ok, but it doesn't track properly and takes several minutes to start working. Then, it'll go days without working at all. I charge it for hours at a time, so I know that's not the problem.",2022,01
Worth it,2022,01
The first mouse lasted 2 months and bought the same mouse to replace it.  It died within a day of using it.  Buy cheap - get cheap.  Not worth trying to have it replaced so am sending it back for a refund.  The first one worked great and had a satisfying button click... a shame it didn't last very long.,2022,01
Box was open and the mouse was dirty. Like really? It looks used and has so many gross black hard spots.,2022,01
Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift. We tried multiple times to sync it to her computer. It would work for a couple of seconds and then stop working. Return window closed and I’m stuck with it.  Made cheaply. Don’t purchase.,2022,01
It really is,2022,01
"Very light weight and comfortable to use for basic computer tasks.  It was also very easy to set up, took less than 2 minutes as it came charged. Also the Vitter life has been great so far only needing to charge 1 time in the 2 weeks of having the item.",2022,01
After looking at the reviews of this particular LED mouse I decided to give it a try. I received it and so far I am very pleased with how it performs. It is extremely lightweight and the LED lights make it so much more enjoyable to use. Highly recommended!,2022,01
Easy setup and small for travel. Great product.,2022,01
"So disappointed. This promised to be a cute and functional mouse. But it never worked. Not even for a day. Charged it, followed all directions (I am tech proficient) and it wouldn’t even turn on. Feels cheap too so I’m not surprised. So disappointing to purchase things that don’t work. All too common anymore.",2022,01
This My Second Purchase Of This Product. So When I Need To Charge one I Have The Other One To  Use. Holds A Charge A Very Long Time  And No Cords .,2022,01
"I love the look of this mouse and it was easy to install. Unfortunately, the gold has started to peel after only a month of use. I’ve passed the return window so this is disappointing.",2022,01
Good buy. Only thing I don’t like is for connector for the upgraded usb is huge and hangs off laptop quite a bit. Otherwise was a good buy,2022,01
cheap easy to use and keeps up with your needs,2022,01
"I’ve used this product before and had no complaints. This time I purchased it, I charged it and the next day tried to use it and it wasn’t turning on at all. Tried to charge it again and the same result. Returned immediately.",2022,01
"Nothing to dislike.  I got it for my grandson, he loves it",2022,01
Excelent product,2022,01
I  am not using it for gaming but I think its cute and love the colors just wish it was a little bighter.,2022,01
The mouse does not work on a mouse pad. I can only seem to get it to work on a piece of paper and even then it’s glitchy.,2022,01
I would like to say I’m very upset and I won’t get another one like I was going to . A lot of crashes on it,2022,01
"I bought this mouse to throw in my laptop bag for those times when the trackpad was too much of a pain to use.  The mouse is slightly small in my hand, but is still comfortable and tracks well.  I really appreciate that it charges from a Micro USB cable. Great value for the price.",2022,01
"I had to update my review because I initially gave it only one star. It abruptly stopped working after 2 months BUT I realized the following day that it was actually a problem with my Mac or WiFi instead of the mouse. When I attempted to print, my Mac was also not “finding” my printer. Ooops. So, I shut down my Mac, my printer, my WiFi and when I turned everything back on, all was well. Not sure which thing caused the problem, but happily, my mouse is working fine again. No one contacted me to change my review. I was not offered anything. As a business owner, I understand how important reviews are, so when something turns out differently… we need to update our review. It’s the right thing to do.",2022,01
It keeps shaking.,2022,01
"Loved this at first, but after only a few weeks it no longer holds a charge and no longer functions.",2022,01
Worked for a few months then stopped intermittently -,2022,01
" I needed a new cheap mouse (and this was on sale) and read through a lot of reviews. I saw a lot of reviews stating that there was a chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white, allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top. Well, that sounded cool to me, so I ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same. I'm pleased to report that it does!So be warned that ordering the white version has a chance to do this, and apparently often. I find it fun though. I'm also happy to note that there is an inactivity timer on the mouse, so when not in use, it will conserve it's battery power by turning off. Clicking with the mouse will turn it back on. Battery life has been good so far too. I work from home for 8hrs a day, and it survives my work day easily. I just plug it up to charge after work.",2022,01
"I only used it once until it was dead and then I charged for hours, it wouldn't even turn on. I have tried keeping it plugged in, restarting my computer and trying the mouse on a different computer and it still doesn't work. And now, of course, it's passed the time to return or get a refund. Even though it's a cute mouse, it doesn't work and I'm frustrated. :(",2022,01
"I purchased this little over 6 months ago but used it only on the weekends on my personal laptop, so not much usage on gaming or extensive clicking.  Immediately noticed the charge does not hold up for less than 2 than 2 “weekend” days so I started turning it off. About 3 months later I noticed lagging in click response.. soon after, clicks were not engaging.. I replaced it with brand name (you get what you pay for).. but I thought I should contact the manufacturer and ask for refund or replacement… it’s been over 2 weeks now and no response. I do not recommend this product or its manufacturer. Beware!!",2022,01
Used it only for the past 3 months and it doesnt work anymore.,2022,01
It’s amazing how only good reviews can be posted but when buyers getting scammed out they hard earned money and want to complain about that the review can’t be posted.,2022,01
Good looking and works great. Love the changing lights.,2022,01
"Haven't done many reviews but think this one was worth the time. I have hands that are a bit larger than normal and feel the mouse fits well in my palm. Very silent mouse great for both office and home use without annoying those in the area. Haven't used the mouse for gaming but also haven't had any lag with the mouse as of now so could be good for that too. Overall if you are looking for a wireless mouse, good for work and home use with good connectivity, I'd highly recommend this mouse.",2022,01
"I bought this mouse thinking it would be a good mouse for my Mac. When i opened it it took many attempts to connect, and then it kept draining all of its battery every night. Do not buy this mouse its quality is very cheap. Overall bad purchase. I will be returning this",2022,01
Love it and works great. Good purchase.,2022,01
My boyfriend got me this as a gift to help with my crafting! I love this color because it goes with my cricut. I also LOVED that it came with an adapter for my MacBook Air. These newer MacBooks require adapters for anything that is not a charging port or the newer charging cords so seeing it come with an adapter is AMAZING! I don’t have to carry around my other adapter and its very easy to use. Love it!! Thank you so much for thinking of us Apple users!!,2022,01
"Great mouse for the price. Nice and soft matte feel. Very quite clicks, perfect for working in a coffee shop. Works well on mouse pads and flat surfaces. And connected to my computer instantly without needing to instal any type of software. NOTE: RGB lights are not customizable. But still cute as heck and works great!",2022,01
"The pros:Decent mouse for what I needed. I like that it is rechargeable via usb port and can be used as both wireless and wired when plugged in and recharging.The cons:These first two are mostly preferences, so take them however you wish. It sits fairly flat so there isn't much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in a mouse. This just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal preferences. Secondly, it has a silent, soft click. Normally when you click a mouse, you feel and hear the click of the button. This feels more like I am pressing on a touch screen. There is no satisfying click nor is there a sudden give in the button, rather it feels like I'm poking a couch cushion. This could be what you want in a mouse, so do with this info what you will.This last con is not based on preferences however. I found that occasionally my cursor will studder step to the left when I am moving the mouse to the right. With the dual screens I have this means that I end up with my cursor all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close a tab, or select a tool in my Adobe programs. It's nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile, but it was enough to stand out and earn it's place in this review.",2022,01
"6 months into using this mouse, it can't stay charged and can barely track.  It works okay (still doesn't track well) when plugged in, but I wanted a cordless mouse for a reason.  Definitely don't recommend this one!!",2022,01
Works great. Was a gift for my mom. She loves it,2022,01
"It's a really nice everyday mouse. The sleep mode is a little irritating because it kicks on so quickly and there doesn't seem to be a way to change it.I don't think it would be great for gaming given its limited buttons and the sleep mode thing, but it's great for office use.",2022,01
The mouse had come in a greasy package and had already been opened before I opened it myself. It had brown and black stains all over the top of the mouse and was of horrible quality. Would not recommend it to anyone looking for a mouse.,2022,01
works well with my dell laptop,2022,01
"Rechargeable, comfortable, haven't killed it yet.. I use it at work, haven't killed the battery, but I charge it overnight, lasts the day for me",2022,01
Does not work,2022,01
It lights up very pretty but is very laggy. Doesn’t track very good with cursor. I can’t deal with that since I use mine for work so I switched back to the mouse my company sent me.,2022,01
"If you want a cheap light-up mouse then get this one when it’s on sale, definitely not worth the $21 price otherwise. It’s very quiet and slim, but that’s about where the benefits outweigh the cost. The actual lighting is not what’s advertised, it’s actually pretty dim even in a dark room. Beyond that, whenever you move the mouse, the red laser at the bottom for tracking movement lights up the whole mouse, taking over the other colors being displayed. Additionally, with the 2 hour charge time and the usb needed for connectivity, you’d be better off buying a nicer mouse for the same price",2022,01
It is a pretty color and works great! I highly recommend this product!,2022,01
The laser is sporadic. Mouse icon jumps around randomly..,2022,01
 I keep it plugged in and I also connected the USB to my laptop but I’m not sure if I have to charge all the time LOL it doesn’t bother me but I love this mouse!,2022,01
Dislike,2022,01
"I used it for my school chrome book, and all of a sudden it fell of my desk , and it broke.",2022,01
"Okay performance while it worked. But definitely won't buy it again, and would not recommend it to others.",2022,01
Love how slim it is and battery free charge like a cell phone and the beautiful colors that surrounds the mouse is outstanding,2022,01
Unfortunately it's been 6 months and now it's useless and unresponsive. Going to have to get rid of it now and get a new one. I guess you get what you pay for.,2022,01
I work on 2 computers all day!!! This mouse has easily become my favorite mouse. I use it for all of my computer tasks on both computers! Love this mouse!!! Very sleek!!!!,2022,01
"This mouse is true to its description in that it's silent and ergonomic, but it wasn't worth the money for me--I bought it in April 2021, and had to throw it out in January 2022. Around November of 2021, I started experiencing issues with charging, where I'd have to wriggle the cord around before it would start charging. By January, it was clear that there was an issue not with the charging cable, but with the charging port in the mouse. It was loose and wiggly when I held the mouse up, and it would only charge if I held the mouse in my hand and kept the charger pressed in tightly. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a cute mouse.",2022,01
"I really enjoy the mouse with the different colors that light up. When clicking the left or right buttons on the mouse, it is very quiet.",2022,01
I grabbed this because I was having difficulty with my mouse pad on my laptop. But it's great I love how compact it is and it hasn't had any issues since I bought it (like 2 years ago),2022,01
"I use this exclusively for my raspberry pis, and it works great. Love that the dongle sits under the mouse itself, makes it easy to bring with me everywhere.",2022,01
"It is a nice mouse, and I liked that it came with an adapter for the macbook. However, the adapter did not work which made the mouse unusable. The adapter seems flimsy and cheap. Luckily I had an adapter and the mouse now works fine. If you are buying this for a mac I would recommend investing in a good adapter.",2022,01
"At first I loved this mouse. The charging time is short, the lights are nice and it worked perfectly. The adapter never worked but I looked past it since I bought a USB adapter for my Mac. Now the mouse acts like it’s dying and won’t have a good connection. It now will not charge properly. I’m so disappointed because I initially loved it. I’ve only had it since a little under a month ago. I’m so upset I wasted my money on this. Now I have to buy another mouse.",2022,01
Received a first time and it was not working. Exchanged and the mouse started acting up after a few weeks.,2022,01
The mouse worked fine at first. Then the battery stopped holding charge for a long time. After 3 month it stopped working completely.,2022,01
This mouse stopped working one month in despite being charged and taken to my company’s tech desk to be looked at to see if I was the problem.,2022,01
"Cute and comfortable design, but quit working after a month. Save your money.",2022,01
Smooth operation.,2022,01
Worked literally for a couple of minutes then stopped. Probably wouldn't trust it with your apple products.,2022,01
"It was working fine at first, I always kept it charged, but after a few months it just completely stopped working. When I try to turn it on it just flashes red and turns itself off. I tried charging, changing the USB ports, and still nothing. Waste of money!!",2022,01
"I was looking at this mouse when my cat jumped on my lap and hit the ""buy now"" button. Turned out to be a pretty good mouse. True story. But, she can't write reviews, so she may be a little disappointed",2022,01
I don't use this every day. It's less than two years old and already time for replacement. The wire casing at the connection point is cracked and internal wires are exposed. Works great but should have lasted longer.,2022,01
"I bought this mouse twice because I wasn't able to return them in time due to mailing issues. I thought the first one must be an error, since it broke after 4 hours of use. Guess how long the second mouse lasted? 3 hours. Absolute crap product and I wasted my money",2022,01
Cool item. Easy to set up. Very pretty.,2022,01
After one month the mouse would not stay turned on even though it appeared to be fully charged.  I will not buy rechargable again,2022,01
works great and the 3 dpi does all i need it too,2022,01
Works perfectly for my MacBook!! Sleek design with cool lights! Would 100% buy again,2022,01
I’ve been using this mouse for a couple of months to do online schooling and now in person classes as well. Haven’t had any problems. Lights make it cute. Works for all I need it to.,2022,01
I love this mouse. It is sleek and easy to use. The led color lights gives it cool look.,2022,01
"I always wanted a wireless mouse but I did not buy one because I though about the amount of batteries I would go through. I decided to give this one a try and I just have to say WOW. I charged it for the first time on 01/07/22 for two hour like the instructions indicated and as of today 01/21/22 it is still going strong! Mind you, I work from home and use this mouse 8/9 hour a day Monday through Saturday, I have not had to recharge it at all! It works so smoothly and it automatically goes to sleep when not in use. I am super happy with it.",2022,01
"Its pretty, it s ergonomic, its rechargeable (no batteries).  BUT and its a BIG BUT, the charge wears off in about a day and it takes 2 to 3 hours to recharge.  And you have to keep track of the charging cord.  The charge dissipates without warning.  This is very annoying - glad I kept my old mouse!  I'm not sure I'm keeping this.  Perhaps its a matter of habitually charging it overnight - like a phone.  I guess I'm glad I'm not a gamer! Having it quit on me at a crucial time in the game would be a disaster.",2022,01
I got this for my school computer. It’s very nice but the LEDS are brighter on one side then the other and the scrolling wheel stoped working after 4 days and the usbc got stuck in my computer. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT,2022,01
"I love this mouse! It is easy to use, and it is very pretty! The lights on it just make it that much more cool! Great product!",2022,01
 This Is So Amazing I Recommend !!,2022,01
Useless. Didn’t work.,2022,01
"Bought two of these; one for work and one for my personal computer, in two different colors. Mouse worked great until the roller ball in each died. One after a couple months, one after less than two days. If you can live without the roller ball, then I highly recommend. But if you use it heavily, I would look at a different mouse.",2022,01
love the color affects,2022,01
I charge this mouse for an entire day and it lasts for 2 minutes. It is awful and I can tell that many other people feel this way but have gotten money to delete their review. I plan on throwing this out immediately and buying an actual rechargeable mouse,2022,01
I have gotten so many compliments on this mouse! first off the rose gold color is so beautiful and dainty! when i first started using i fell in love that in changes colors and has the capability to turn off! highly recommend! great price as well!,2022,01
"Great fit, compact but very responsive.",2022,01
It is really quiet and colorful.,2022,01
"The scroll wheel on the mouse broke after less than a week of using it. I liked the mouse before that. It was easy to setup, comfortable to use, and the colors look nice. I really liked the silent mouse click. But now that I can’t scroll with the mouse I will need to buy a new one",2022,01
It did not work I ended up returning it.,2022,01
It looks nice & lights up. Difficult to use since it freezes up the computer & for some odd reason will even knock off my bluetooth headphones. Do not waste your $,2022,01
Kept “skipping”. Wouldn’t track properly although right next to iPad,2022,01
Doesn’t recharge and the arrow on my screen moves very choppy and jumps around so half the time I can’t click on what I want.,2022,01
Sleek and reliable,2022,01
Best mouse I have ever used. Very smooth and really sharp looking.,2022,01
I really liked the color and look of the mouse but the scroll never worked even after fully charging it.,2022,01
I have a MacBook and this mouse required two plugins...since I take my Mac with me the chances of these 2 plugins being lost was a pain....,2022,01
It was a good mouse while it lasted but died on me suddenly 5 months after purchasing. Purchased 7/15/2021 and died 1/19/2922,2022,01
"Super sad because I was obsessed with this mouse but it has already stopped working after one month. Super frustrating, should had just gone to Best Buy originally.",2022,01
For one this mouse is not compatible with the c adapter and not worth the price by giving false information about the device. Update it and see why the c adapter isn't working or remove this item.,2022,01
"Nice looking mouse, beautiful colors, and comfortable hold for any sized hands.The battery on this thing is surprising, charging does take time, but seriously, that won't be a problem because this thing can last long.I do suggest turning this off to make sure the battery doesn't drain, sleep mode is brilliant but do turn it off so you won't get caught off guard for when It does lose battery.",2022,01
"I followed instructions for charging and tried a few different methods, but could never get this to power on or work. The company was great to quickly refund it, though.",2022,01
The mouse falls asleep right away. The cord for recharging is only about 4 in 5 in long. Constantly needs to be recharged.  It is definitely not a five-star product.It looks cool.,2022,01
"Be ready to turn it on and off every 2 mins of non-use, the thing goes into sleep mode then is sluggish in its response time till you restart it.  not something I would reccomend",2022,01
Works great long battery life love that it turns itself off very smooth used,2022,01
"It's a cute mouse, I like the colors, and it's ergonomic. However, I've only had it for a little over 6 months and the scroll wheel just came loose and stopped working. I've never had that happen with a mouse, so it's not the best quality in the world.",2022,01
The crazy mouse will not hold a charge. I have to plug it in after 30 minutes of use. Defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse. My alkaline battery mouse would last for months and then just a simple battery replacement. Do not buy!,2022,01
Comfortable to use,2022,01
It is so pretty. The lights are gorgeous. I love that it is rechargeable BUT the roller in the middle broke and I haven't even had it for 3 months. I use it for work so it doesn't get a lot of use either.,2022,01
"Till now this LED wireless rechargeable mouse is one of the items I am glad to have invested in. It is easy to use, very light and fits just right in the palm of my hand... It has a very nice modern look and is also affortable... Thank you seller for the quick delivery and aftersale communication...",2022,01
The micro-USB to USB-C adapter does not work. You are better off ordering a mouse that connects directly to the computer via direct bluetooth (that does not need a receiver),2022,01
"Once I got this product I read the manual and did everything step by step including charging the mouse, and it will not work! After 5 minutes of messing with it the LED lights started flashing and I got it to work for a little while then it stopped again! This product is not good and I needed it for school, but I would hate to take an exam and i have these issues!",2022,01
"Works fine but it feels like a toy a kid would use. Super light and made with a thin, cheap plastic",2022,01
This mouse works really well. The only thing is I don’t feel like the battery lasts very long. I use it for work and those are 8 hour days of non stop computer work. I only get about 4-5 days of use before I have to recharge again.,2022,01
It lasted last than 2 months!,2022,01
Excelente,2022,01
"Very good, reliable mouse.  I was not disappointed.",2022,01
"Works well , but son broke within a week.  Dropped it and it shattered.",2022,01
"Loved the product look and that it was rechargeable, however the battery didn’t hold the charge long enough for the device to properly connect via Bluetooth so you had to leave it plugged in which defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse. Also the shape for the mouse provided little comfort as it caused my palm to cramp after two days of use. Returning item and going back to Logitech brand.",2022,01
I bought this for home office and I liked it so much I bought a second one for work to use instead of what the company supplied to me.  It’s everything the description says it is.  Very comfortable too!,2022,01
"I needed a new mouse for my laptop. I decided to wire less a must and rechargeable.  This fits all my needs, plus a an automatic setup.",2022,01
The mouse won't charge anymore... I put it on charger for hours and when my daughter trys to use it all it does is flash red and doesn't work... so much for her Christmas present,2022,01
Loved it!!!!,2022,01
Fits my hand perfect. Like the lites and the sleep mode to save battery life.,2022,01
1,2021,12
"Has worked well for over a year now (bought 10/2020). Light still glows, no issues with the function. I don't game or anything so it's had light use. It has a surprising amount of battery.",2022,01
"At first, it was great, however, after a few months, it just stopped working...disappointing.",2022,01
Worked fine for about 6 months then wouldn’t charge again after it died.,2022,01
"Ordered this for my new laptop, works like a charm. includes a charging cable, adapter, and usb receiver that can be stored in the bottom of the mouse. the colors light up very nicely and customer support was lovely (contacted them about activating warranty). my only issue with this mouse is the shape, which was more flat than the mice I'm used to using, but that is just personal preference and I got used to it very quickly. overall great product.",2022,01
I had a similar mouse that lasted two years....this one died after only a month.  Would work after charging for a few minutes and then stopped.,2022,01
Nice mouse responds well works great with my windows 11 laptop battery life is fair haven’t had it long so far it’s been good will update,2022,01
"Came fast, no set up required just plug in and go. The kids in my classroom love the light up feature.",2022,01
"Battery life seems to be decent. I have two of these and both have issues with the DPI randomly changing itself so I have to click the button to change it numerous times a day. Every now and then the one I use at home doesn't 'connect' when turning on the computer. I have to unplug/re-plug the dongle. I do have it plugged into a USB switch, but seeing as it's the only device that encounters this issue I don't believe the problem is the switch. Not likely to buy this again, it's been too frustrating.",2022,01
"Unfortunately, the item doesn't recharge after just two weeks of use.  Disappointing product.",2022,01
"It is nice, easy to use. I love it!",2022,01
Another piece of China junk sold through Amazon.  Charged until the light went off (mouse charged).  Plugged it in and it stopped working minutes later.  Did the same thing a second time … same result.  Thanks Amazon for continuing to peddle garbage products to your customers.,2022,01
it doesn’t work,2022,01
"Died within the first month of use.  Nice mouse, I wanted to use it instead of the trackpad on the laptop.  Too bad it didn't work for long.",2022,01
"This was a great mouse until it stopped working after about 3 months of use. Mine appears to no longer charge. Therefore, I do not recommend buying this product.",2022,01
"I ordered this mouse for a part of my son’s birthday gift. It arrived next day, and he was very excited. Unfortunately, he couldn’t click anything with it even though he could move the cursor around. Since he threw away the original box, I could not return the item, so I decided to contact the seller. They have a great customer service, and she sent me the replacement right away. This time, the mouse works perfectly fine! My son is so happy to have this cool looking mouse. The price is amazing too!",2022,01
"Poor quality, last only 5 months",2022,01
"This is a great little mouse. For someone like me that has smaller hands, and some nerve issues as well, it is light, not bulky, and works so smoothly. I would highly recommend it and will purchase another for a friend!",2022,01
The mouse is cute and I like the colours but it dies every hour and I have to plug it back in and just revert back to the mouse pad. Will be returning and getting something more basic with longer range of not having to be charged up.,2022,01
"It’s a decent mouse, lower middle in quality, but reasonable price at fifteen.  Feels kinda cheap, wheel is noisy.",2022,01
"my first impression of this mouse was that the design was not well thought out. because i ordered the mouse in white, the inner workings of the lights can be seen through the top of the mouse every time you move it (and you can't turn off the red light!) because the white plastic is translucent. however, i ignored this issue because it was purely an aesthetic problem and didn't mess with the functionality of the mouse. unfortunately, a week or so later, the mouse wheel completely stopped working. i've since then gotten a new mouse for even cheaper, and not only does it look better, but it also feels better and holds up well. don't waste your money",2022,01
"I got this wireless mouse for my daughter because she was getting tired of using the old wired mouse for playing games on the PC.  So far her experience with it has been great, the size was perfect for her average teen hand and she's a lefty.  The main avantage was the mouse was rechargable so we don't have to worry about replacing the battery every so offten, a plus for me.",2022,01
The charge port messed up not even a month later. Super disappointed,2021,08
"I purchased this mouse for home office.I don’t have a glass table, but I guess surface is too smooth for it to work.Silent operation, very comfortable.Battery lasts a decent time.Lasted for a week straight without turning it off.Not returning it but not super happy with the issue.",2022,01
Standard wireless mouse. Works well.  What I really like about it is the colored light at the sides.  :),2022,01
"Ordered shortly after Christmas and once arrived I had issues connecting, after realizing my only route to get it to work was to constantly turn the mouse on and off. After less than a week and one charge it will no longer do anything. No lights, no power, no connection and won't charge with the included cord or any other. Spend the money on a different brand this was like ordering from wish.",2022,01
"Fits in my big hands nicely, with the mouse wheel having a non sleep feel.I bought two of these, one for my work laptop and one for my personal laptop. Not too long afterwards, one of the BT dongles went AWOL. The seller sent me a replacement which for me sealed the deal as a good investment/purchase. Of course the LED colors were icing on the cake so to speak.",2022,01
Love it!,2022,01
"I really liked this mouse - very convenientHowever, I bought it less that 2 months ago and the wheel stopped workingVery disappointed",2022,01
Ugh! Can't return since outside my return window ...stopped working!,2022,01
" The mouse is low profiled, easy to use. It connects instantly and is ready to use as soon as you plug the adapter into your computer.It is very comfortable to use. And the video shows it’s extra cool light show.",2022,01
Sorry. Usually I dont leave bad reviews but this one takes the cake. It started working at first but then it started to be very laggy and then no longer worked. Now.. i am using a brand new MACBOOK so maybe it's the USB converter that might be a problem. But currently not a fan.,2022,01
"The texture is very good to hold, and mostly very quiet. I feel very good about this shopping experience, the shipment was very fast, and it arrived much earlier than expected.",2022,01
"Stopped working, stopped chargi, stopped lighting up!Contacted customer service and they sent out a replacement that showed up 2 days late.New one? We shall see!",2022,01
Love it would recommend works great love that it’s light and can’t hear when you click the mouse lights are very cute,2022,01
Loved this product but the scroll recently stopped working and I must turn it off and on during use..,2022,01
"Small, lightweight yet firm solid feel. Led lighting is a nice touch. Shuts off automatically once laptop or pc is shutdown. However the main reason I purchased was because of the silent feature. Sadly it's not as silent as I had hoped. Clicks are still audible especially on scroll wheel which is disappointing. Why cant someone make a truly silent mouse? I have yet to find one as most ""silent"" mice are merely muffled by a rubber lining. Shame, would be perfect otherwise",2022,01
"This was my second purchase. I bought one in June and it worked fine. The charging port metal ""liner"" part fell out, so it couldn't be charged. I got another and used it for about an hour without any problems. I charged it, used it for another 2-3 hours, then it just suddenly quit. When I turn it off and on again, the red lights flash once then nothing. Completely useless.",2022,01
Love it,2022,01
The motion is glitchy. Sometime it moves very slow. I tried different surfaces and it didn't help.  It also goes to sleep even though I took sleep mode off.,2022,01
I like how it is,2022,01
I have to say I'm impressed. Not only does it light up but I accidentally dropped it in a dog bowl full of water and it still works!!! Can't ask for more than that for the price.,2021,12
"This mouse is amazing, it is ergonomic, cheap and functional. Defenitly a great choice for business.For games I don't have an opinion cause I don't play computer games.",2021,12
"I travel a lot & wanted a slim, light mouse for work and school. This mouse is perfect, it’s fully charged in 3 hours, slim, comfortable to use for hours, & when fully charged it can last for days. Also the changing light affect is pretty cool. I definitely recommend this mouse for someone who either works from home or is a college student :))",2021,12
It was nice while it lasted. Unfortunately for me that was less than three months...,2021,12
I charged the mouse overnight and it died within 15 minutes of using it. Tried to charge it again and it will not charge. Threw out the box so I can’t return it.,2021,12
"Just plug and play.  So easy to use and very sleek and slim looking. I like it when the light lid up.  Its soo cool! This is my 1st rechargeable mouse.  I really like it!  I am going to try it for a month and if it work well, I will buy another one.",2021,12
No computer mouse was amazing,2021,12
Nice mouse for a few months of light use. After that it would not take a charge even tried swapping cables. Big disappointment,2021,12
I’ve had this mouse for less than a month and it’s already glitching out moving the curser without me moving the actual mouse. Cool colors though,2021,12
"I needed a new mouse for my laptop and decided on this design based on its ergonomics.  However, I’m used to the taller mouse so it took some getting used to this design.  I’m not completely sold on it, but I’ll give it a go.",2021,12
"I've been using it for less than 2 hours, and my wrist is already quite sore. There is no ergometric support whatsoever. And are all the lights really necessary? I find them annoying.",2021,12
love my led light up mouse. it's very quiet. and no more clicking noise. yay!!!!! thanks. Amazon,2021,12
Great product!,2021,12
A sweet ergonomic mouse with good responses.,2021,12
"Got a good deal. Nice item, was exactly as described.",2021,12
I wish it had a way to let me know when it needs to be recharged. I like how quiet it is and the lights are just fun.,2021,12
Only used it a few times and I like it.,2021,12
"The mouse works fine. It is slim, kind of cheap plastic, but the lights - which in photos look like it would just be a thin line around the mouse - are very annoying. The entire thing lights up. You can not turn them off and still use the mouse, it is very distracting. I did not try to return it because there is nothing else wrong, but I will donate it to charity or someone. Ordered another one with no lights!",2021,12
Used for 6 months and now it won't charge.,2021,12
"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. For a “wireless” and “rechargeable” mouse it sure didn’t get the memo. It refuses to work without being plugged in, we’ve let it charge over night and everything. Would not recommend.",2021,12
Very good mouse. I'd recommend.,2021,12
Felt cheap. Returned for a better product,2021,12
"So cute and ergonomic, holds the charge really well probably due to its auto sleep mode and works like a charm!",2021,12
"Easy to use directly from it's box. Simply charge it with the USB cord included. Plug in the dongle receiver to your device. Reboot your device and it locates and installs itself. Turn the mouse on and your ready to work or play, etc",2021,12
"Not enough of a curve to use comfortably.  Performed it's basic functions, for the short time it was used.",2021,12
I bought this mouse with the expectation that it will work… however it becomes unresponsive (freezes) frequently enough that I have to use my touch pad half the time. Cheap and fun but not good if you use a mouse often.,2021,12
Seems nice enough in the hand but didn’t work. Could click both the left and right mouse buttons but moving the mouse would not do anything. Had to return.,2021,12
Glitches after 3 minutes on all my devices lol this thing is straight up garbage,2021,12
I was skeptical of how good this mouse would work and it is great. I really enjoy that it has a feature to shut it off.  The last wireless mouse I had ran on batteries and died all the time bc it wouldn’t shut off. It is smooth to move around and works great !,2021,12
The first 30 seconds it works fine. Then is glitchy and is worthless.,2021,12
It's  a good size for the work it does. Great price,2021,12
Out of the package my initial thoughts were that the product seemed very cheaply made and those thoughts were confirmed when after one month of use the product stopped working. Would not recommend this product.,2021,12
"It works fine however, sometimes it does not response when you move your hand. I also do not recognize when the DPI is activated or not. Also, when you click the bottom, it does not response so you have to press it more than one time for it works. Also, it is felt very plastic.",2021,12
Won’t work at all!,2021,12
Definitely worth the money,2021,12
"Ergonomically I find it to be too short and a bit uncomfortable. I bought it as a travel mouse so I could over look that, except that it barely works. Every time I have tried to use it it eventually gets super laggy and almost impossible to use. Turning it off and on again fixes it but only until it starts to lag again.",2021,12
"easy to use, charge lasts a long time",2021,12
"Really great mouse and affordable to buy and its mouse click is super smooth , i love it so much",2021,12
"Too flat, hard to use",2021,12
"It broke, the mouse is unresponsive the wheel is isolated. It is inconvenient having to charge the mouse every few uses through a cable. It 1",2021,12
Currently returning this product. Even after adjusting several things on it this mouse just doesn't do the job. Hard to click so when you do get a click in it's not where you wanted it.,2021,12
Didn’t work from the minute I opened it. Don’t waste your money.,2021,12
" This mouse is super cute, however its made out of all plastic and it stopped working. I tried using 6 different chargers including its own. I've left it charging for a few hours and nothing! Super disappointed.",2021,12
"I plugged it in to charge for 4 hours, the moment I unplugged it, it wouldn't turn on and wouldn't connect to my laptop. but if it was plugged in, it worked and connected. I wanted a wireless mouse, not something that needed to be plugged into a charger to work. im working from home on a laptop and wanted something that worked but now I have to wait longer for a mouse that actually works.",2021,12
"I like it! Ergonomic, sleek and sleep mode is great!",2021,10
"I liked the look, feel, and price of this mouse. However, after less than 3 months of moderate use, while playing a game, I clicked the ""wheel"" and it broke. This item was not made to last. Cheap and not worth the money in my opinion.",2021,12
"I had this mouse before without the LED lights, worked like a charm. But despite this version that says the LED lights are able to turn off...they DON'T. The switch on the bottom to shut off the lights do not work, the ""ON"" button shuts off the whole mouse instead of just the lights. So basically I'm stuck with annoying flashing lights.",2021,12
"It's really nice, exactly what I wanted except when it changes in light it does automatically and the transition is a bit glitchy at times ,but i still love it.",2021,12
This was a Christmas gift and the recipient was thrilled to death when gift was opened. I was given a demonstration soon after gift was opened. Looked great with the changing colors of the device.,2021,12
"Light weight, very easy to use, charging lasts for long, I like that it has the usb attachment in mouse making it perfect for travel",2021,12
"Overall, I really liked the mouse. I enjoyed the colors and the feel of it was very nice. The main problem I had is that I specifically bought it for work for my Mac laptop. The adapter didn't work at all. I had to keep holding it down at a specific angle in order to use it at all. Very disappointing......",2021,12
"I only used this mouse for a short while, but it works very well. I was able to connect it using the USB transmitter very easily.  It does what it is supposed to do",2021,12
"When I bought it expecting it to last more than a month, then last week I noticed something wasn't right. Sure enough the end oof the wire that plugs into the PC was breaking ..and I really was happy with it at first not having to buy batteries for it..",2021,12
"The color is spot on.It is ergonomic and more flat than arched.Sometimes I think it is too wide, but yet it's not.The price was right, the color choices were great.Overall happy that I found this mouse.It was for my Apple laptop as it didn't have one and  hated not having a mouse to navigate",2021,12
Like the quick response the mouse has.  Lights up and easy to manuever.  Love it.,2021,12
"I'm happy with my purchase! It wasn't an expensive mouse, it's wireless and rechargeable, all things I was looking for. It is a slim mouse which took some time for me to get used to. I only use it for office work tasks so I can't speak to other uses. However I don't notice any lags, delays or other issues. I do wish there was some way to control the colors but it's not a big deal. Also the top clear button clicks but I haven't figured out what that does.",2021,12
Doesn’t hold charge for very long. Has dead spots have to shake to get to move sometime,2021,12
Has a nice feel to it. Very smooth and responsive. Like the changing lights around the edge. Very colorful.,2021,12
This item is trash. Do not waste your money. I have only been able to use the mouse once without issue. Just do not work at all now.,2021,12
I loved this mouse until it stopped working after about a month of use. It is plugged in and charging but is not responding to movement after about ten minutes. I’ve tried multiple ports and turning it on and off but the thing won’t respond. It’s illuminating in just blue which it’s never done before. Don’t buy it,2021,12
"Works fine, nothing special and not quite as smooth as standard mouses you can get at big box stores for $25",2021,12
Hard to install. Gave up on its use.,2021,12
"I'm going back to basic and battery operated.  Lost charge at inconvenient times. then started being temperamental on taking a charge.  Now it won't take a charge at all. Worthless to me, waste of time and money!",2021,12
"The design and color is awesome ! I also bought this product for my b/f as well, and would definitly recommend this product to family and friends.  There is nothing to dislike about this product",2021,12
I purchased this with the hope to use it for my home office to get rid of my corded mouse. I was very surprised when I was scrolling and all of the sudden the scroller seemed to sink deeper into the mouse. I took it apart in hopes to fix it only to find that the scroller just snapped off.,2021,12
"This product only lights up in red. Not multi colored as described or shown. Other than that that, it’s okay.",2021,12
Left button not working after 4 months…for $15 not worth it…save you money and look for a better one the last.,2021,12
This is the second time I’ve replaced this mouse and after being fully charged the power doesn’t come on. Will never buy again!The product support is nonexistent!,2021,12
Very lightweight and I like the looks of it but the right click button stopped working after a few months,2021,12
Great use,2021,12
I bought this at the end of August 2021 and it worked great until now. Now it won't hold a charge and I can't return it because it has been over the time. Very disappointed.,2021,12
"This mouse is prettt okay. It works fine and lights up pretty, which is a bonus. I’m not a fan of the feeling of clicking, though. I wish I bought a different mouse for that reason. But I will hold onto it for now.",2021,12
no one problem so far it works perfectly and the look is amazing,2021,12
"I bought this mouse to replace an older one that had just cracked.  I love the feature of charging them by USB in place of batteries.  So much more convenient.  Easy to setup, mouse clicks are completely silent which is also a nice feature.  The changing led color light on the inside is just a bonus that makes it looks cool.  Comfortable use, slim design and really like the no-slip material of the mouse.",2021,12
"I was searching for Bluetooth mouse. I found one, but didn't like the color. When I changed to the silver one, some how it switched off of Bluetooth.It is wireless and did work with the USB dongle.The buttons are quiet and the movement was smooth.Unfortunately I have a MAC and the USB ports are only USB-C. The mouse does come with an adapter, but this makes it stick out far and will get damaged.I had to return it.",2021,12
Mouse takes a long time to connect and I spend way to long to try to make it work. It got here fast though,2021,12
"Very sleek design, bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. It connected easily to his chromebook and the lights are pretty cool.",2021,12
"love the color changing led lights, easy to use, easy to charge. lets see how long it last",2021,12
Tested this out after charging it. So far so good.,2021,12
OMG what a piece of crap can't right clock seriously. Looks great & did like the slimmer line of it too bad don't work.,2021,12
"When I received this product the first time, it had come broken. The entire click pad was nearly separated from the base and couldn’t easily be snapped back into place. I sent in for a replacement and everything was all fine! They sent a replacement no problems. This was in April.Flash forward to December, a mere eight months. The mechanism that holds the scroll wheel somehow snapped apart and the scroll wheel is now 100% useless, which makes playing games a bit difficult, as many games use the scroll wheel. When to contact customer service? All contact is closed.Use caution when ordering this mouse. At first, the replacement I had been sent was good, despite it not exactly having any sort of indicator as to when the mouse needed to be charged; but if the scroll wheel’s mechanisms are gonna snap easily under potentially hard gaming sessions? Perhaps pass for something more heavy duty.",2021,12
Purchased for a Imac compter.  Seamless setup and operation.,2021,12
I ❤  not buying batteries!,2021,12
Don’t buy,2021,12
"This is a really great mouse; it works as designed.  Unfortunately, I don't have the patience for the very slow response time. It was aggravating waiting for it to respond to my finger commands. Needless to say, I got rid of it and bought something different.",2021,12
its just not good at all. the colors don't show as good as shown. It does not connect to MacBook and the mouse tracking his slow and horrible,2021,12
I love this mouse. It has a cute and ergonomic design and doesn’t need to be charged often. The only thing I don’t like about the matte black one is that it shows fingerprints easily.,2021,12
I've had this mouse for almost a month now and it's great quality and works awesome stays charged for a while I've only had to change it once and I use it for working at home several hours a day! Definitely recommend ! I got the pink one and it's so cute!!,2021,12
"Not only does this feel like the cheapest mouse I have ever had the displeasure of holding, the USB type C adapter is a loose fitting piece of junk.  Not even worth the hassle of returning.  This piece of garbage only flashes red for a second then quits doing anything else (even after being charged for 8 hours).  I have attached it to 4 different devices and nothing.  I guess you get what you pay for and I this instance...JUNK",2021,12
"Disappointed with this product, stops tracking after a few seconds of usage regardless of how I have it charged. Faulty product 👎🏽",2021,12
I liked the sleep mode. Price is reasonable. I also liked the shape.,2021,12
Bought this for my kiddos laptop. She likes the lights and the almost weightless feeling. It was a good buy for the price and works great so far.,2021,12
Works as described. Nice design and functionality. Highly recommend.,2021,12
"So, I do like that the mouse fits well in my hand. Is very responsive and works very well for everyday use. I like that the mouse click is very quiet. I have had NO problems with the mouse so far. I would recommend this mouse as it works very well and you can also adjust the sensitivity, or how fast it tracks by adjusting the DPI. Nice feature to have.",2021,12
These stop working after a short while. Bought 4. They all have been returned. Spend a couple bucks more and buy a different unit,2021,12
"Mouse is nice, I thought there was an option to not have it light up since I don't need that function but the 3 options are off, one color, and alternating many colors. It only lights up while you are moving it and the light is off when its still. Glides good, clicks well. My only really issue with it is the scroller wheel can be a little unreliable, if i want to scroll down just a line or two it won't move and then if i scroll just a little faster it zooms down the page. Overall decent",2021,12
"its a cool little mouse, got it for work reasons like the RGB on it. works as intended. not really pricey.",2021,12
"This mouse works well and is easily rechargeable and portable. I wouldn’t recommend using it for gaming, but it’s perfect if you need a wireless mouse to take with your laptop.",2021,12
"Update 4.2.22: I tried charging more often and making sure I turned it off. Seems it doesn't last as long as I'd hoped. Switched back to battery operated Bluetooth mouse.Worked well for the time being. I bought 2 and the other is still working, for now. As of now, I've tried to use it on notebook, tablet, and desktop to ensure it's a connection issue. Maybe it's the battery, but I'm not sure. If sleep mode is active, the battery shouldn't be having issues in such a brief time of having it. It should last a few days after a full charge (overnight).",2021,12
Love the mouse my only downfall is that it’s very light and I’m used to a little heavier one so it’s something to get used too.,2021,12
The mouse no matter how much I charge it no longer turns on or connects to my computer. I normally try to avoid making negative reviews but this is honestly not worth the money I spent on this. All I wanted was a mouse to help me work on my Macbook and this was just a huge disappointment.,2021,12
"I purchased this to replace a broken battery operated cordless mouse.  I think I dropped it one too many times. I thought I would give this rechargeable mouse a try. I hope that I won't have to recharge it too often.  I only had to do the initial charge so far, and I do a lot of clicking. I also chose this one for its flatter design.  My other one was higher, and after using it a long time my hand got stiff.  Maybe this one won't do that. So far it hasn't.",2021,12
Only worked a few weeks and thats it. Waste of money. Whats worse is I barely used it.,2021,12
The mouse only worked if it was plugged in not at all wireless like it says,2021,12
"So... my review after using this mouse for 2 months:- there are a lot of glitches that makes the cursor on screen jump from one area to another- the mouse STOPS WORKING in the middle even after making sure it is fully charged. You have to turn off the mouse, put the mouse on charge for an hour to get the mouse to start working again. I will not recommend this mouse to ANYONE!!!!- Couple days later... the mouse has completely stopped working and there's no customer service response.Update: The mouse is still not working. I have made three attempts so far to reach out to the company, but they don't respond. The quality of customer service: 0.Update 2. It’s been over 8 months since I got the replacement… even the replacement is horrible. It stops responding. The action time is delayed. When you left click… it doesn’t respond. This is even after I carefully keep the mouse.",2021,12
I have had this mouse for a while now. I love it! It's perfect size and the color change is probably my favorite part. I don't have to recharge it everyday but I really only use it for work. so I work an 8 hour day again it really doesn't need to be charged often. When it's time for a charge the color will start to shift to red. Everyone that's seen it has asked where I got it and that they want one!,2021,12
I bought 2 of these back in October for me and my mom. After a month and and a half of regular use for mine it no longer works. I thought I wasn't charging it enough until I opened my mom's. Hers brand new out the box did not work either. Very very disappointed. I will not be purchasing again. Do not but it isn't worth it.,2021,12
"This mouse was very useful and relatively enjoyable the first week and a half. At two weeks, it seemed to glitch. The cursor would jerk and freeze. So I connected the mouse to the charger. It was ok for a couple of days, but sadly succumbed to its cheapness this afternoon.Very cheaply made product. Maybe those 4/5 star reviews are bought?  Very disappointing.",2021,12
Loved this mouse and the battery last pretty long,2021,12
"So I teach prek and we have nap time. What caught my attention was the quiet clicker. I didn’t think it would be as quiet as it is, but it is extremely quiet. It’s also easy to set up and easy to use!",2021,12
"I bought this 3 month ago was working perfectly fine until last week then for no reason it stop working properly. It's not responsive ,the cursor move does not match the movements of my hand and I can no longer use it.I just ordered another mouse from other brands",2021,12
"Good for the price, tracks kind of poorly and the LED colors are not great",2021,12
Easy for my 10 year old to set up and use. After 2 weeks the wheel broke.,2021,12
"It's extremely uncomfortable to use. Maybe if you're on a trip and need something to do the job, this will work.Definitely not for daily use, gaming, or work.",2021,12
Good gaming mouse . I use it to play game!,2021,12
"Truly a mediocre mouse, yes it lights up in different color but everything about this mouse is mediocre.  Cheap feel, the scroll does not work very well, the click is not very good, movement of actual mouse is not smooth.  Don't be taken in by the pictures....trust the previous poor reviews.",2021,12
"I was a bit skeptical about it being a “quiet” clicker but was pleased to learn it really is quiet. The clicks are greatly muffled and are soft to the…click. My only complaint is that the scrolling wheel does not click quietly.The lights are enjoyable but don’t display a constant stream of colors as they forcibly/manually change when moved or clicked. They otherwise will rotate when the mouse is left idle.Overall, it’s a really nice mouse to buy and use. Comfortable and light—kind of reminds me of the Apple mouse.",2021,12
"I loved this mouse.  I used it for a few hours of office work once every week or two.  So very light use in the scheme of things for a computer mouse. I received it end of June, and it is currently middle of December. So about 6 months until the roller/scroller part of the mouse broke.",2021,12
This mouse was extremely cheap,2021,12
Only used a few times and the left click broke. Might want to select a different one,2021,12
Hate how slow and moving action is.  Adjustments don't work.  Worse mouse ever had. Looks neat but that's all.,2021,12
This is the worst mouse every! I charged it over night with the usb still in my computer and then when i got up to use it in the morning it wasn't turning on.,2021,12
Amazing product able to take it where ever and connect when needed nice and small fits any where  a need for on the go!,2021,12
"I was looking for a simple, inexpensive wireless mouse to use on a server that I only have to access occasionally. This fit the bill perfectly. Drivers installed automatically from Windows 10 and I'm off to the races. Great price for a simple solution.",2021,12
"So far, it works great",2021,12
"This wireless rechargeable mouse is exactly what I wanted, its light and just the right size for my laptop. With so many options on Amazon I'm glad I chose this product, and the sleep mode function and colors are really cool, would recommend this product to anyone looking for a awesome mouse.",2021,12
"It wasn't until my husband gave me his mouse to play my Sims 4 with that I realized how much I loved using one, even on a laptop. He said I could have his red and black one, but lo-and-behold, when I opened up Amazon and put in 'wireless mouse', I found my own type of dream mouse. I got the mint green colored one and honestly I'm obsessed with the glowing of the different colors. Great mouse, great price. I wish I needed more than one to be honest.",2021,12
"Charged the mouse over 1h, use it for 5min it completely drain out….. and it too late to return since I bought it months ago. What a wast.",2021,12
So I got this in the mail and immediately started using it. It worked great in the beginning. Super quiet and the color change is cool but after a week or two I was using it and it just stopped working. It would turn on but wouldn't work on my laptop and it was the only computer I have used it on. I can barely get it to move on the screen and then it just shuts off. But it really was great when I first got it.,2021,12
"This is the worst wireless mouse I've ever had the displeasure of using. I bought it thinking how bad can it really be, it just needs to connect to my laptop. Well, if this could be a negative star rating I would do it. If you stop moving the mouse for 10 seconds or more, you have to turn it off and then turn it back on again because it loses its tracking and doesn't respond to your movements. It doesn't have any accuracy while clicking things and its uncomfortable to use. IT IS GARBAGE.",2021,12
Complete trash. Would not charge.,2021,12
"Works great! No problems so far, lights up nicely.",2021,12
"I needed this for work, rechargeable, nice looking, easy to use  but broke after 3 weeks",2021,12
Exactly what the title says,2021,12
"I needed a slim, responsive mouse and I got exactly what I needed! I bought for work, and connected with no issues. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a reliable mouse. A+ customer service too.",2021,12
Type C adaptor does not go in the computer port properly so it doesn’t work.,2021,12
This didn't last 3 months before it stopped taking a charge. Will not be buying another one.,2021,12
Works well with something underneath otherwise it seems to “wander”. Besides that it feels great.,2021,12
It broke after only a week... the little thing in the middle to scroll stopped scrolling.. I got one just like it from Walmart for cheaper and it actually bluetooths to the computer.,2021,12
Very comfortable and the sleep mode works well It looks good too,2021,12
"just spend the extra money on a mouse that will actually last you more than TWO USES, I'm highly annoyed",2021,12
"This mouse is super clean-looking and connects fast. It not only recharges within 2 hours, but it lasts a long time. I've been using it pretty frequently for the past week and only charged it once. It's still going strong. I love how it lights up and it can be used on a mac or windows computer. Very light and easy to transport as well.",2021,12
"I initially loved this mouse. I liked the fact I could recharge it instead of batteries. However after the first week, it just stopped working. I have recharged it and still nothing.",2021,12
Mi laptop,2021,12
This thing literally started skipping after 5 minutes of use,2021,12
Love this product. Working from home and love the color! Works great,2021,12
I like this mouse because of the LEDs and the color. But the USB converter that it comes with is not reliable. I had to use a different one in order for the mouse to be usable. I have also noticed sometimes a lag in clicks so I wouldn’t suggest this for gaming or something where you need to be super responsive and precise,2021,12
"I bought this mouse in April 2021.  I liked it a lot for 8 1/2 months.  For the last few weeks, it has stopped tracking reliably and the battery dies within about a half hour.  Even if I try to use it plugged into the computer, it stops tracking and the lights dim.  I can't find any warranty information on it.  I feel like it should have lasted more than 9 months.  I think I'll buy a wireless mouse with a known brand name and hope for better luck.",2021,12
"Its just literally not working at all. I charged it for three hours and connected the USB to the adapter and plugged it in to my MacBook and it just does not work. I have turned it on and off, put the USB back in the mouse and tried again and again and it just will not work. Instructions were absolutely useless since it just said to turn the mouse on and off.",2021,12
"First purchase, I received the wrong color. They switched it out no problem. Second mouse came, and it stopped working within two -three weeks. Because of the shipping coming from overseas the whole process just made the product less appealing. Disappointed it stopped working so soon.",2021,12
I get so many compliments in the office about my mouse. It’s a huge hit in the office and now 4 coworkers own it in different colors,2021,12
I purchased this mouse for using with MacBook pro 2021. There is no lag while using it and is compatible with MacBook.,2021,12
Just stopped working after the 2nd charge cycle.  It worked well at first but then just stopped working.  Waste of money.,2021,11
"Okay, I understood that having a mouse with cool shifting lights was probably going to result in somewhat reduced battery life; I just didn’t expect THIS. The mouse seems to have no sleep mode (the lights stay on unless it’s completely switched off), and the battery lasts less than two days, brand new. I thought to myself that I could make that work by just remembering to plug it in at night, because I do like how the mouse feels and works ... except last night I plugged it in, and this morning, 10 hours later, it WASN’T DONE CHARGING. I have resorted to just keeping it plugged in all day while using it, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a wireless mouse in the first place, and ties up two USB ports instead of just one. Shame. Back to the drawing board on my mouse search.",2021,12
"overall I really like the mouse, but the scroll button doesn't work. Also, I was not able to find a way to contact the seller to resolve the issue.",2021,12
good product,2021,12
This mouse is sleek and looks great. But more importantly it works awesome. It moves smoothly and clicks like a whisper. I also love not having to change batteries every other day!! Buy this mouse! I am definitely going to buy an extra or 2!!!,2021,12
This mouse was bad quality.,2021,12
I used this mouse for a laptop. It slowly stopped holding a charge. Disappointed and happened after return item window closed.,2021,12
Super cool,2021,12
"Won't connect to my Dell laptop running Windows 10. And I'm not a computer illiterate moron either. This mouse just flashes a red light twice and doesn't connect. The system shows it's connected, but doesn't recognize. I'm returning to spend an extra ten bucks for a name brand Mouse that will work.",2021,12
"I’ve had for lass than a month and it already doesn’t work anymore. I left it on for a couple hours while i was away (fully charged and working perfectly when i left) and when i came home, it refused to work. i have charged it, i have taken out the usb and reinserted it and i have turned it off and on a million times and it just doesn’t work anymore. i am so incredibly disappointed and upset that this broke after less than a month and cannot return it as i don’t have the original packaging anymore. i would give negative stars if i could. i wish i could get my money back to buy a different mouse but unfortunately i can’t anymore. don’t waste your money on this.",2021,12
I'm using it at work and all day. The Battery lasted 6 days before a recharge. I ordered another one for home. This is a good product with a good price,2021,12
Love it!,2021,12
I loved this mouse! Until is stopped working after 3 months.,2021,12
 Nice for the price. Would buy again.,2021,12
"I bought this mouse because I needed a wireless mouse for work. It came in a cheap box written In mostly Chinese. It is a nice color and it was easy to setup. I used this for work for 2 weeks, and today, I went to use it and it stopped working. It didn’t register on the computer. I am sending this back for a refund and I’ll just get a logic tech.",2021,12
Slim and ergonomic mouse.  Cool LED lights while using it.,2021,12
"I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it, I definitely would be buying one for myself soon!!",2021,12
"Very Quiet! Also, very easy to set up!",2021,12
Great mouse!  Love the lights when using it.,2021,12
I love the quiet click! No more obnoxious loud clicking.,2021,12
"I bought this mouse for a friend & he/she loves it... it is better than the mouse that comes built into he/her laptop... plus it was brought as a replacement for it...As for my friend, she tells me that she loves that it saves her a lot of money on batteries, & she also loves the cool extra lights it has & features on it...",2021,12
"The design of this mouse is nice - I have small hands and this mouse is somewhat small and flat. However, it doesn't have a very smooth movement.  I used it for about an hour and disconnected it from my laptop.",2021,12
"The mouse Clic is silent, it feels very ergonomic at hand, the battery lasts pretty good, my daughter loves itThe lights are so nice specially at night with the room lights offGive it a try",2021,12
So easy to set up and works great! I have had no issues so far. It is perfect also because it comes with a mac compatible connection port. It has made my work sooo much easier- It is smooth and easy to use. I love my new mouse!,2021,12
"After two weeks, the cover just plain separated and couldn't be snapped back on.",2021,12
"First use it connected right away. Has not worked since, don't waste your money.",2021,12
It works well.,2021,12
This is a great cordless mouse. It is rechargeable as long as the computer is on.  There is a place on the bottom to store the dongle if not in the computer.  If dropped it will come apart.  Unfortunately it does fly in a special education classroom.  A stronger shell would be great. Also an extra dongle in case you lose the first one.,2021,12
Unresponisve and choppy movement. Clicks fail to register. Horrible experience with gaming. Rgb looks bad. All around avoid.,2021,12
I bought two of these and both stopped working. This worked great until it just didnt. You cant even charge it anymore it will glow like it is charging and then nothing. Both of them died and stopped charging within a week of each other.,2021,12
"Nothing really to say, it didn’t work with my macbook",2021,12
Initially had an issue with the battery but the seller reached out and corrected quickly. Appreciate the support!,2021,11
"It advertise change of color of the light. Mine is only Red.The buttons I have to hit it very had (to the point that I started to click on the board, because my finger hurt.Very pretty, very sleek, so far works very good.",2021,12
Use for two weeks then it stop working. I tried charging it and everything.,2021,12
"If you are like me and have trouble using USB to USB-C converters (somehow I always end up with flaky ones that don't maintain a connection) be warned that this mouse uses the same method to support USB-C. It comes with a USB and USB-C adapter, however you have to plug the USB-C into the USB adapter to use it. You cannot use the USB-C adapter on its own. Which means I have a 2"" long, double adapter sticking out of my computer, just waiting to get knocked off. Had I known up front that the USB-C adapter required the USB adapter to work, I would not have made this purchase.",2021,12
"I bought this mouse not even a month ago, it quit working. I have had it plugged in for about 15 hours to charge it. Does not work. In order to use it I have to keep it plugged into the computer. Waist of money.",2021,12
"Sleek, good battery backup, auto sleep, LED lights, silent clicks",2021,12
"I bought this because I hate using the mouse pad on my laptop and it’s great to throw in my laptop bag and pull out when I need it. It charges by plugging it into the laptop but I haven’t had to do that yet besides giving it a full charge when I opened it up the first time. It does go into sleep mode to save the battery which took a minute to figure out but once you realize that it’s not broken, just asleep, it’s all good! Overall it’s just a basic wireless mouse that works well and is sleek and portable.",2021,12
"Positive quality, great color",2021,12
"USB-C adaptor is not working, but that's why I bought this mouse.",2021,12
I really like this mouse for work. I use mine all day I charge it on Wednesday mid week and leave it charging Friday over the weekend. Works completely fine. I'm coming back and buying two more. I had to come buy more because I dropped mine and it cracked open that's the only reason why. Not because it stopped working but because I broke mine so this time in also getting a backup! My work laptop is a Mac and I'd rather much buy this mouse than the expensive Apple one.,2021,12
"The idea of this mouse sounded nice and fun. However, I was very disappointed to see that the usb is slightly bigger than other usb cables and it did not fit into my laptop, or any other usb port for that matter. Perhaps this one was defective, but this was unacceptable. I would give zero stars if I could.",2021,12
This mouse works great with my new laptop for business use. Very pretty and sleek. Love the led lights.,2021,12
"i followed all instructions, nothing happened, and the mouse does not work at all, nothing pops up linking the mouse to my computer",2021,12
"And it's only wireless half the time. The other half you'll have it plugged in and charging because a charge doesn't last very long. That's why they give you that little short charging wire that plugs in the front of the mouse. That makes it hard to use when charging. Everyone knows it's easier to drag a chain up a hill than to push it up. Well, everyone but these people.Update - the battery has completely gone dead. It won't even take a charge anymore after only three months. You have to keep it plugged into your laptop at all times, and even then it goes dead occasionally if you use it too much or too fast. You have to wait 10 to 20 seconds for it to ""charge"" just so you can use it for another 5 seconds. It's even worse than the 2 star rating I gave it originally.",2021,12
Definitely serves a purpose and matches my decor.,2021,12
The wheel breaks easily,2021,12
End up returning it within 2 weeks of purchase.  This is light (not in a good way) weight.  Feels like its cheaply made. My clicks and moves were not in sync when I clicked the mouse to my new Surface Laptop.,2021,12
for browsing,2021,11
 Great design overall. Let’s see how long this mouse lasts me. Love that the noise clicking is very quiet. I also love the glossed turquoise color. No problem connecting to the Bluetooth on my computer.,2021,11
It twitches only the screen and I constantly click the wrong thing even when it’s not physically moving,2021,11
Tried to take this to and from work and the wheel in the center is no longer functional,2021,11
"I am a fan on jelly bean type of mouse. I had a previous jelly bean mouse that I ended up giving to a family member and was searching for another one to replace it and I came across this one. The lights is the one that did the trick for me here, just love the lights, other than that its a nice, light mouse, could have been a little shorter, its a longer mouse compared to my previous one, but other than that very functional and light and can be carried in the pockets to meetings in offices which is what I do primarily with this one.",2021,11
Easy install and fast charge up,2021,11
"Purchased 6-7 months ago and nothing to do but throw it away--charging port is loose and won't connect with cable.  Flimsy and not made to last, like nearly everything today.  The colored lights might be fun, but better to pay for quality that doesn't need replaced.",2021,11
"This mouse is wonderfully priced for its diversity. It works with the chromenook, my boy' xboxes, all our phones... And its comfortable and quiet",2021,11
"Works good, not great. Feels good if in small hand, I don't have small hands. The color LED is cool BUTTT everything will bleed with the red of the eye. I use it work my work 5 days, 40hrs a wk. Definitely have to change it every week of u leave the LED lights on, I might be able to get another WK if I turn off the LED",2021,11
Maybe this one was a bad one but the battery didn't hold charge for to long and now is not even charging no more and is only a month old,2021,11
My 10 year old loves it and it fits well in her hand as well. Some light gaming here and there. Good product for the price :),2021,11
I really love this mouse for my laptop. I don’t have to worry about changing out batteries. It doesn’t take long to charge but charge last awhile with normal use. Bought one for myself and a second for my daughter.,2021,11
I bought this product 2 months ago. The wireless had good range. You can use it while charging. Color led looks good during night time. Simple and handy. Fast charging. ON OFF buttons. Worth for money.,2021,11
It took one week of using this mouse before deciding to just get a better quality mouse.,2021,11
"great product, no issues",2021,11
cannot wait to use. seems to be really nice,2021,11
I like it cause I don’t have to spend money on batteries,2021,11
"Used it twice! Was so happy with it! Worked great! Tried to use it the last 2 days and it doesn’t work at all! Turn it on, light comes on, then turns off and won’t turn back on. Not pleased!",2021,11
 It’s a good mouse led good im still trying learn how it works but so far so good for now,2021,11
Works well. Worth it,2021,11
USB C adapter doesn't work and light on mouse fuzzes out when plugged into a different computer that allows for usb.,2021,11
"Great product and packaging overall, durable materialsSmooth point and (silent) click featureEasy to follow instructionsBright led lights make this mouse FUN for any age! (bonus:you can opt to turn the led function off if/when needed)Tired of all that clicking?  This mouse is for you with the silent clickDefinitely a product worth owning!",2021,11
For my laptop and received it the next day.,2021,11
Exactly as described.  Works great fir my chromebook.,2021,11
"In short: you get what you pay forI am currently traveling and needed a cheap mouse I could use. This one definitely does the trick and looks nice with the colors on the side but also has a couple downsides: the DPI change button doesn't work on Mac, the colors at the border aren't really bright and even + the red light of the sensor always shines through, it also is a bit small if you have big hands (which is a upset if you're traveling, since it will fit in small spaces)In general: it is a good mouse if you do not want to spend a lot of money but there are things that could be better if you want to spend a bit more.",2021,11
Of course I didn't expect high quality product for this low price. But man the mouse didn't even last a week. It's dead. I charged it just one time and dead. It could have worked at least half a year. I just can't believe that Amazon let sellers like this run business on their platform.,2021,11
"I was looking for this mouse for my new Samsung Galaxy tab S7, have a really good and soft clic, you don't have to worry about the battery. If you need a wireless mouse this one is for you. I highly recommend this one.",2021,11
"Did not work well for me, only worked when it felt like it. Very inconsistent.",2021,11
"I chose this ergonomic mouse because I liked the shape and it seemed to be easy to hold and use. When I received it, I was thrilled because it is so colorful! I also like that it will work with my little mouse pad I use for my Chrome Book~! I have used it since it arrived and I am happy with it so far! With this mouse, I can play my games easier and it is also quiet and easy to use! I recommend this mouse to all! I am a happy customer!",2021,11
It is hard to use and the sensation is not good.,2021,11
"PC mice i've purchased in the past lasted years, not months. i caution purchase of this mouse for tha reason.",2021,11
"Once I received this product, I am very satisifed with how it looks and how light it felt. It is also very convenient considering it is rechargeable with no batteries needed. I HIGHLY recommend this product 👌",2021,11
I love this mouse and I can’t wait to get another one just like it. I use this one at work and it’s very comfortable and not loud clicking either .,2021,11
Love this mouse it’s small and slim. Works great and you can turn the lights on or off to meet your preference.,2021,11
Works as expected.,2021,11
"A bunch of the lights are out so that’s kinda annoying. I could tell the box had been opened and it was probably a return. It’s not super ergonomic, at least for people who would wear med/large size medical gloves.It does what it’s supposed to do but I’m gonna get a different one for my work computer and use this one for my personal computer that I use maybe once a month. It doesn’t feel very good in my hand to use all day at my desk.",2021,11
"Mainly a mouse youd keep at home on a desk, not really suited for travel, battery life is great, I charged it once a month ago and for being in highschool, all of our work is on the chromebook, and this mouse hasnt died yet",2021,11
Mouse feels like it's of good quality and so far haven't had any issues with it working with my XPS,2021,11
super unresponsive. fun idea but would not recommend to anyone.,2021,11
Bought this for my son to use for school. The roller bar broke the second time he used it. In addition  to this it wouldn’t stay charged. 100% dissatisfied customer!,2021,11
"I really like this wireless mouse.  I love the changing colors, and the rose gold is gorgeous.  My only ""complaint"" is the the USB (to connect to your laptop) is very hard to get out. I always need some sort of tool to get it out. Ergonomically, since this review had me rate it, it's perhaps a little too slim. But, I don't game, and I'm a light laptop user, so I doesn't bother me that much. Otherwise, I would buy again and put up with the pesky USB when I travel.",2021,11
I love this mouse! So glad I went wireless makes my desk so much more organized💕,2021,11
I am very happy with this mouse and love the color!,2021,11
I've had the mouse less than 6 months and both the roller wheel and the piece that plugs into the USB port both broke. I managed to super glue the roller wheel back together but it just broke again. Buy a slightly better mouse if you can. Not sure if all the reviews are even real.,2021,11
I like the look and feel but the mechanic's of using it are slime after a week,2021,11
"Battery life is horrible on this mouse, won't last more than 5 minutes, thought it was a fluke and got a replacement because the mouse is comfortable and cool looking but the second one they sent me was even worse with a whopping 1 minute battery life after full charge.",2021,11
"Pretty cool mouse. Honestly, was only looking for a simple mouse to use with my laptop. The tracking works great and the colors are pretty cool...nothing like adding a little color to your workstation. Being able to recharge the mouse is a plus.",2021,11
Lights are visible through white part because white part is thin but it’s nice,2021,11
Not suitable for long term.  It broke after 2 months.,2021,11
"It has too much lag, it's slow & that's why I hate it",2021,11
" I don’t use the color changing feature, so with that, the battery life lasts a really long time! I say that because I purchased this May 20, 2021 and my battery just now needs charged December 1, 2021 and I use this 5 days a week for work 10 hours a day. I love this product!!! No noise, sleek, comfortable, just love it! Worth it, hands down!",2021,11
"I really love how easy it is to setup this mouse, nothing to download just plug and play! I have been looking for a slim mouse that works on my Mac and windows machine that doesn’t need batteries or a mousepad and this definitely fits the bill. The lights are a cute, fun addition but are subtle enough to not be a distraction while using and don’t seem to drain the battery too much. Overall I think it’s great for anyone looking for something easy to use.",2021,11
This mouse was great for about two months. Then it stopped charging and won’t work. Don’t waste your money!,2021,11
"Hello, received the new mouse today, thank you and your service is very good , again thank you. But the only concern that I have is that the box is open and my power cord is dirty and not wrapped up the way it should have been.  But that is okay, I am going to plug this one in. And it work then we are good to go. Again thank you so such for a fast re-supply.I Give you( 5 stars ).Mr. Ronald Wooten",2021,11
"I was tired of the wire noises and the knots they created. It was always a mess, plus it stopped working hence I was looking for a mouse. This mouse is amazing. It is light, easy to connect, the LED works good, doesn’t make sound, and the customer service is good.If you are looking for a mouse with a low budget, this is definitely the one you are looking for,",2021,11
I bought this mouse for my wife but I loved it so much that I had to get a second 1 for myself. It has a really great feel and it works really well,2021,11
The mouse is slim and lightweight. I love the way that the inbuilt LED light in the mouse changes its colors. It is very easy to install the mouse on the laptop.  The day I bought the mouse I have been using it without charging the battery for 15 days. After surfing the mouse on amazon I thought I found the right mouse for my computer.,2021,11
"I always wanted a mouse which is similar to the apple one and found this to use for my windows laptop. its very stylish.RGB light looks pretty cool. Like the sleep Feature, it goes to sleep pretty quickly saving the battery and also that the mouse is rechargeable.",2021,11
"Don't order it, it does not function well at all.",2021,11
This mouse was so cute and easy to use. I love the colors. But after two months it won’t connect to my computer. It sometimes lights up but not consistently and my computer doesn’t recognize it.,2021,11
Do not recommend this product. It was super cheap feeling and did not work well at all.,2021,11
"Mouse only “right clicks” making it useless. I have read others are having this problem too. Went into computer settings, everything is set up right. Mouse does not work",2021,11
I suppose I shouldn't have expected much for the money.,2021,11
It doesn't work,2021,11
"This mouse is very slow in reaction, not sensitive to the movement and make my hand tiring already after 10 minutes usage, too bad I only start using it after the return window closed.",2021,11
I find that not having to rely on battery is a relief. The color change is very nice,2021,11
I had high hopes due to all the positive reviews but this mouse became virtually useless after just 3 weeks. I would move the mouse on the mouse pad back and forth and it would barely move on the screen. Every task on the computer began to take 4x's the amount of time it used to. I had to resort to using the trackpad on my Macbook which I'm not a fan of. Definitely don't get this mouse. Not worth it.,2021,11
It's really a waste of money. Bought it in August and started falling apart end of Sept and completely broke in Nov. Not worth the money.,2021,11
"Wow you really can’t go wrong with this mouse. Bought it for work since they still have the wired mouse but the traction is horrible. With this replacement, no wires no cables only to charge it. The traction is great very responsive.",2021,11
I got this because I have a laptop and sometimes that little square isn’t enough. It’s easy to set up easy to use I have no problems as of yet,2021,11
Not worth the value,2021,11
The adapter for the laptop doesn’t work… I have one from dell which worked fine.,2021,11
"I absolutely love this mouse, it’s super easy to use and really fun with the different colors. 10 out of 10!",2021,11
"I was very disappointed in this mouse. I had a hard time clicking it and thought maybe I just had to get used to it. By day 3, I wanted to throw it away. I bought a new one and kept it for students to use if they need it. (They hate it too)",2021,11
I like that this mouse is rechargeable. Feels weird in my hand and doesn’t move as fast as I expect,2021,11
Great product. As advertised. Works really well very nice.,2021,11
"I bought this mouse back in Sept 2021, to match my laptop color that I use for my Work From Home job.  The 2nd week of  Nov 2021 it stopped working.  It will no longer charge up.  Needless to say I am not happy.",2021,11
The mouse doesn't work. The reason they have good ratings is because they ask you to rate 5 Star and promise refund. Don't buy.,2021,11
"Super cute. Works great. LOVE the rainbow lights. However, it takes a while to charge, and the charge does not last long at all. I don’t even bother to use it anymore because it’s not even worth the hassle.",2021,11
mouse wheel doesn't work,2021,11
"It was a great mouse, until it stopped working and charging. I literally only used it about 5-6 times since buying it and when I put it on the charger this last time, it just completely stopped working. The charger light wouldn't come on and it wouldn't charge. I even switched USBs to see if it maybe had a short in the wire, and still nothing.Now that I'm reading other reviews, I see the problem. Wish I would have read them thoroughly before buying it.Buy this only if you want something short-lasting, with pretty colors. Other than that, I don't recommend this at all.",2021,11
I got the pink one and it is so nice! I love that it's rechargeable. It is very well made and works perfectly. Comes with a USB-C adaptor as well. It's a great size and there's no lag. Overall I'm very happy.,2021,11
"It got delivered a month ago and it has stopped working after using for like the 4th time. It turns on them off immediately, it’s got a charge and just won’t work. Glad I got my invoice since I can still write it off as a business expense. Not a good product and will not buy again. Not very pleased with this device.",2021,11
Quit working already,2021,11
Fits comfortably and it is very pretty.,2021,11
"Love the lights that shine thru, very light and easy to pack for travel. Instant setup. Very pleased with this wireless mouse.",2021,11
Love this mouse. It's the coolest one I've ever had. You can't go wrong with this item,2021,11
Just received my mouse.  Connected to computer immediately with no hassle.  Works smooth - no jerky motion.  Guides to your movement without any hesitation.  Quite buttons with feeling of padding underneath.  Love it.  Lights are beautiful.,2021,11
"You get what you pay for.  Noted.I have to click this mouse at least three times to get it to do what i want, on any button on it. It is so frustrating and i find myself wishing i would have spent more for a quality product, which i may now have to do anyway bc im just so unhappy with it.  It is so cheaply made (plastic all around) i wonder how this can justify a price of over $5.  JMO. Others seem to like it. It just was not what i am looking for. I used it as replacement to my iMac mouse (circa 2012) which finally died. I miss the magic mouse but not $79 worth. Lol im going to have to find a happy medium. This mouse doesn't get it. At all.Only redeeming factor is it is rechargeable.",2021,11
Horrible,2021,11
"I just brought this mouse for  my laptop game, cheaper and function enough for me. Good buy!!!",2021,11
"I like that this mouse has a sleek look to it. Slim & ergonomic. Good quality, not cheap looking. I like the color options available. Very easy set up.  I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and it works great! I have not used it for gaming.  Great price and i will likely buy my next mouse, for a different computer I have, from the same place.",2021,11
This product is awful,2021,11
"First off I love the color, it’s what made me purchase it in the first place. I didn’t need a mouse, but I like having a spare.Now for my review, as far as what I’m used to for comfort, this mouse sits FLAT. So be aware of that if you plan on using it for long periods of time. Fits nicely in your hand, I have medium small hands, so please take that into consideration with the review.The lights, I loved the different light modes, it actually made it feel like I had a $150 gaming mouse, while not being so hard on my wallet.Now for push button response… my right click wasn’t working properly, barely clicked down and would sometimes Mia click from it being mispositioned. I had to lift it up to see the issue was the prong was bad. I broke it off and now it is clicking as intended. So please be aware, this is all VERY fragile plastic within its housing.Overall the mouse is great if you need a spare, and I would buy again if I needed another. I hate out of 5 stars, because 4/5 feels worse than 8/10…but I feel an 8/10 is more accurate to how I feel, as it has a lot of great features, such as charging vs batteries (and an included usb-c adapter). Overall a wonderful product that I do recommend",2021,11
"UPDATE 12/6/21:Seller has contacted me asking me to remove my review and attempting to bribe me with money to do so. I expected this as several other comments say they too received the same bribery. They even went as far as sending me a “here’s how to remove” link.Purchased this as an upcoming Christmas gift for my sister as it was similar to one she wanted that is not available right now. The box for the mouse is mostly in another language and paired with the price that prompted me to test it before wrapping it up and giving it to her come the holiday. Let me just say, I am glad that I did.While the mouse powered on and worked fine with the USB dongle that it requires be plugged in to use, I decided to test it's other feature of being able to charge it while using it. Everything worked fine UNTIL I UNPLUGGED IT. Once I unplugged the micro-usb cable from the mouse my entire PC turned OFF. I thought maybe it was just a fluke so I tested it again. Nothing happened the second time so I plugged it back in for a little bit to make sure it had a full charge on it for her, and when I unplugged it to re-package it, it happened again. As to say I am now running virus detecting software to err on the side of caution and this product is getting returned as defective.Moral of the store, don't buy cheap products.",2021,11
"Product was great, just the delivery was horrible this is the first time I've ever had issues, they crammed it so tight in my mailbox I like to have never gotten it out and could've damaged my product just by trying to get it outta the mailbox.",2021,11
I really liked the mouse but it broke after a few months. It does not follow my commands (eg copy and paste).,2021,11
"Absolutely nothing is working on this. Acts like it’s charged, but it’s not? Won’t Bluetooth to my computer…nothing is working. Don’t waste your money.",2021,11
So frustrating! It just responds less and less. Even immediately after charging for a full day! So disappointing.,2021,11
I bought this for a backup wireless mouse.  It only lasts about 4 hours per charge. Not good when you work remotely for 8 hours a day.,2021,11
"The colors are fun and different. The thing I did not like was that the default color is red, if it is not in rainbow mode. The material is okay. It works at it should. It is great that its rechargeable. It holds a charge for a long time, and if you forget to turn it off, the sleep mode works well.",2021,11
Comfortable and easy to use. The sleep feature is convenient because you do not need to charge as often.,2021,11
"It charged within an hour or two out of the box. I like the lightweight, slim feel of the mouse. The storage of the USB clip is secure and pretty easy to get in/out. While it's not ""important"", I like the changing colors of the lights inside the mouse. Just a fun feature. So far it works great for the inexpensive price!",2021,11
"I've tried so many wireless mice over the years and one of the most annoying has always been how quickly the battery dies and they are not included. When I ordered this mouse, I got it because it lit up and matches my laptop. When I got it, I was pleased to learn it was rechargeable! Mind blown and brilliant! The mouse, will go into a sleep mode when you aren't using it, or you can turn it off and on easily.Perhaps the only con is that it doesn't come with instructions.Absolutely, love this mouse and I highly recommend it!!",2021,11
"The mouse is big enough to use and very smooth with my computer. I always look for a wireless mouse, so this one is the best on amazon that I could find—highly recommended!",2021,11
"Terrible quality, after 4 weeks no good, will not recommend buying at all, its a waste",2021,11
reasonable price however item stopped working.,2021,11
It is nice looking and quiet,2021,11
This mouse quit working after 2 weeks. Poor quality. Returned!,2021,11
"I've had 2 of these randomly stop working in the last year. Both stopped clicking after minimal use(less than 7 days on the first one, less than 30 for the second). I don't understand why this product is so highly rated, it's terrible! Learn from my mistakes!",2021,11
Looks just like the picture.  I don't know about sleep mode or gaming as I use it for my office.  The only thing I wish was different was that the charge be updated to the newer c charger like my Samsung phone and laptop.,2021,11
Works great,2021,11
"Good wireless mouse, portable, ergonomic and the size is just right. Love how it has lights and changing colors.",2021,11
I bought it for gaming and everyday use. It stopped working really fast. It lags behind which was driving me crazy. Then it just died after a month. Don’t waste your money,2021,11
Works well when charged. Nearly impossible to charge though. The port connection must be off.,2021,11
Stop working after a few days. Do not buy this mouse.,2021,11
the good part about it is very convenient and it saves a lot in batteries and you can still use it when charging to the laptop. also the lights lets you know when is time to charge it. like it a lot,2021,11
"Loved it as long as it worked. Stopped working yesterday. I even tried charging it again but it wouldn't even do that. With only a month to return if not working, I am out a mouse and must buy another one. Too bad as I really did like this model. Now onto shopping.....",2021,11
Love it!! This mouse is very sleek and thin. 100 A+,2021,11
Didn't work.,2021,11
This does not fit on my laptop.  The part that fits into the laptop to make the mouse work did not fit.,2021,11
I thought this mouse was really cool. But then it broke. The scrolly wheel thing doesnt move anymore. It lasted like a week. And its not my main computer so it didnt get used much in that week.,2021,11
"I needed a wireless mouse for my new MacBook Pro that only has USB-C connections.  This mouse included an adapter that allowed the standard USB Bluetooth receiver to be used in the USB-C port.  I have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far, but it seems very responsive and performed well.  The led lights are kinda cool, but not really needed.  I'm trying to see if there is a way to use the mouse without the led lights on so I can conserve the charge on the battery.  The only concern/issue I've had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapter don't seem to be the most secure, and a couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging.  I was still using my laptop while the mouse was charging via the USB-C port as recommended in the user manual.  The user manual specifically recommends NOT using a plug-in charging adapter like for most cell phones because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it.  It is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your laptop to avoid overcharging and damaging the mouse.  I'm not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if I continue to use my laptop while trying to charge the mouse.  We'll see how it goes in the future.  If it turns out that it was operator error, I may update my rating.Overall, though, the mouse feels good in my hand, and it seems to work well, doing everything necessary when I need it.",2021,11
"I bought this as just a quick way to navigate my tablet in a hurry. The sleep mode is perfect since I don't use it but now and then when I hear an alert, just tap to wake up and click. No need to keep re-syncing and the charge has lasted a LONG time. Tiny but not too tiny!",2021,11
Adorable Mouse. It works very well and I love that you are able to recharge it. The mouse speed is very good and overall very enjoyable to use while working from home.,2021,11
Sleek and easy to use and fast charging,2021,11
"The mouse itself is easy to use. However, the usb-usbc adapter does not work. I couldn't get the mouse to work with my macbook until I bought a different adapter.",2021,11
"Like this new mouse :)It works well and installation was also very easy.So far, I really satisfy its performance and quality.",2021,11
Was great! Had smooth control & felt great in your hand. I had a small issue getting it to charge but I figured it out. I love the style & function of this mouse,2021,11
I have it for my personal computer and it has worked out great,2021,11
"I bought this mouse to use with my MacBook since it comes with a type-c connector. Overall I really like it, the color matches my MacBook and it’s slim so it fits in my little bag where I keep my chargers in. I recommend this for office work but not for gaming, your wrist gets tired since it’s really slim",2021,11
"Straight out of the box it is sleek and feels good in my hand. However, it does not read on or off the mousepad. Very disappointed.",2021,11
"Just by the Logitech and skip the ""savings"" from this cheap import.  I bought this to replace a wired mouse on my kvm switch and it worked great... for two months.  Would plug in to charge (using an open USB port on my switch was super convenient), turning it off every night while it charged.  The next day, unplug and flip it to the middle setting so lights were not on constantly, and I was able to use for the whole day 8-10hrs no problem.  Then, about two weeks ago, same usual routine, go to use the next day and completely dead.  Revert back to wired mouse and let it charge until lunch (4hrs later), swap back out... lights come on for about 10 seconds and again: completely dead.Now I'm out of the return policy not even 6 months later and screwed.",2021,11
"I ordered this mouse because I was tired of using my laptops track pad at school. It arrived on time, charges quickly, has a very satisfying and quiet mouse click sound and overall is a great mouse for the price. The only issue I face is that the RGB on the front of the mouse is almost completely broken and there are small sections around the edges that are broken as well. It doesn't prevent the mouse from doing its job though and I often find myself using the mouse with the RGB off anyway. Overall, good mouse just don't expect the RGB to work amazingly, it is only $14 after all.",2021,11
"This product is excellent, I love its lights, it charges super easy, it is soft to the touch and accurate on movement.",2021,11
"Good mouse I can use for working at home, ordered the rose gold which is pretty cute for desk decor and the lights are fun. It functions well and it’s quiet when you click which is great",2021,11
The mouse worked fine for maybe 3 or 4 hours with my PC laptop. Tried it on another laptop and desktop with same result. The cursor moves intermittently and is not useable. Fully charged the mouse and tried with and without USB-C adaptor and no change.,2021,11
Stopped charging and working after a month. Thought it maybe have just been dead. Charged it a lot more and still didn’t work. Looked at reviews and saw that many others had this issue as well,2021,11
"Cannot go wrong for the price. Buttons are totally silent and feel solid, same with the scroll wheel. Not a gaming most but I've had no problems with accuracy. Comes with a slim USB port and a pretty large USB C port but it allows for USB passthrough which is neat. Can't speak to battery life yet but it seems to have great power saving features so. Easily recharge with micro usb. Note: this does not have Bluetooth.",2021,11
"cordless mouse is okay out of the box, after a few months of use it's starting to wear out. I now have to start double clicking to make sure it responds to the icons I click on. colors are still great. It's great not having to change batteries, it's pretty much quite as far as clicking, but as noted above it will still wear out sooner than expected.",2021,11
I love this mouse. Cool color scheme and comfy to use,2021,11
it does not work at all ! I cvharges itight goes on then all of a sudden turns.off and its like touching a toy plastic.like mouse its not worth the money,2021,11
No quality,2021,11
small but solid.,2021,11
"I bought this mouse for my son to do homework at home. He was excited to to used it. This LED wireless mouse have so many color to choice. The mouse is light weight, rechargeable, pad smooth button are easily to click and responsive. I love it because is good price and you can bring for work and traveling super easy. I am definitely recommend this mouse.",2021,11
"This mouse is amazing! Very comfortable, smooth and aesthetically pleasing. Charge lasts forever.",2021,11
It connected immediately with my computer and makes no noise and i like the ergonomics on the mouseI can move my mouse faster than my other mouse,2021,11
"Used it for about a week and when it stopped working, we could not get it to recharge properly.",2021,11
"Stopped tracking well after a week of use. Waste of money, spend a little more and get a better quality mouse to begin with with.",2021,11
It's a very nice wireless mouse，very quite，the color is very nice too，I like it so much,2021,11
We got this mouse for my teenage daughter and at first it worked great! She’s only had it for 6 weeks and it stopped working.,2021,11
Pure junk,2021,11
"Great product, Fast shipping",2021,11
"The product is as pictured and even works as described however, it stopped working after less than a week.  I have tried to charge it using different ports and wall outlets, checked the USB/Bluetooth connection, and even disconnected and reconnected however it is still failing to work. I am in the process of returning and will be looking for a new replacement elsewhere.",2021,11
"It had connectivity issues right out of the box. I contacted the seller and he/she did not respond. It never worked. Even if it had, it is so misshapen it isn't comfortable to use. Cannot recommend seller or product.",2021,11
I cannot get this mouse to work even when I plug in with cord,2021,11
Worked effortlessly right out of the boxAnd the shipping was lightning fast,2021,11
Great,2021,11
Mousewheel doesn't work... yikes,2021,11
" OH MY GOD. This was EVERYTHING I was looking for. I bought a mouse and keyboard for my phone, because I wanted to type my essays on my phone, when I don't have a computer. And this mouse works on my phone! Yay! And it's my favorite color",2021,11
"So we’ve gone thru quite a few wireless items over the last few years. This one by far has knocked it out of the park. I actually allowed my 9 year old to pick her mouse this year (she’s 9) and she picked based on color. I read the description. The review’s were good and the price was right so we hit “buy now”. I love sleep mode, I really love that it’s rechargeable, battery lasts weeks. I like that it lights up when it’s charging and let’s you know when it’s done. And an added bonus: it’s the cutest shade of baby pink.",2021,11
"This product does what I need it to do, and does it perfectly. I'm super picky about stuff, and I can honestly say I am very well pleased. I do believe I have to turn it off for a moment when it hibernates, but that is whatever to me. Haha",2021,11
"Wireless mouse went out ordered this one. Arrived early. Feels good in hand, easy to control. The lights are ""cute"" as they change colors lol. But the overall feel is good. Not huge and the recharge is most def the highlightThank you",2021,11
The tracking on this mouse is not great and to add insult to injury the mouse stopped working after about 2 months.  Worse yet I missed the return window by days.,2021,11
I’ve been using this mouse for work since I received this last month. It worked great the whole time and I charged it once a week. Now it won’t turn in. I thought it needed to be charged so I plugged it in for a few hours. I turned it back on and it won’t work at all.Normally the lights are all on when the switch is on. It won’t even pick up my cursor and I have to use a different mouse to work. Very disappointed that it didn’t even last me more than a month. Don’t waste your money.EDIT: the seller emailed me offering me money to delete my review. Sounds like they do that to everyone. Seems like there would  be way more negative reviews for this trash product if they weren’t paid to delete them.,2021,11
Charge last forever,2021,11
"UPDATE: I actually purchased three of these and received them on August 20. I began using one immediately for work. I put another one in my computer bag for when I travel and the third was intended as a back up. As noted below, less than 3 months after I purchased these, the first one which I was using daily quit working. I got the one from my computer bag which had never been used because my travel for work has been limited due to the pandemic. This one quit working after only 4 days, on November 15. I then went to the third one that I bought as back up. After using this one for less than a week, it has started to malfunction. The scroll wheel has quit working, but everything else still works. On November 23, I received an email from the manufacturer asking me to delete my review in exchange for a refund. I received another email the next day with misrepresentation that it was from Amazon ""costumer service"" also asking me to delete my review in exchange for a refund that I could expect in 48 hours after removing the review. I'm not sure if the misspelling was intentional to avoid getting in trouble with Amazon or just poor commend of the English language.I purchased this on August 20 and it quit working on November 11, less than three months after I purchased it. The return window was 30 days so no chance I will get refunded for this piece of garbage. Don’t waste your money on this.",2021,11
I love this mouse and the best thing about it is my favorite color. Sleep mode is a great thing. And very colorful. It’s a must have.,2021,11
"I work remotely from various locations throughout the day mostly doing data entry. This mouse is great for what I do. Always works, cool color.",2021,11
"Mouse worked great, for a few weeks…then it started to have a mind of its own. I’ve charged it overnight, but the cursor jumps all over the screen, or does not move.Had to go back to a wired mouse, until I purchase a new wireless oneDo not recommend, this mouse.",2021,11
"This very cute mouse works seemlessly and well.Comes with some charge so it works out of the box.There are 3 modes - on, off, and light changing, which is really nice!The scroll wheel is smooth, but pressing on it is a bit stick.All in all, a great buy for a great price",2021,11
"It was cool when it worked, but it stopped working in less than a month. There were times where i would leave it on all night or till the battery died. But it doesn’t charge and the bottom red light just blinks and then shuts off when i try to turn it on.",2021,11
"I use this with my laptop at school and it works great!  I haven't had to charge it yet, but you can still use it while charging.  It thin and fits neatly into my bag.  I left it on accidentally for a couple of days and it had turned off and the battery was still good.  The lights are fun and can be turned off.  So long dead batteries!",2021,11
I had to replace a second one of these because a single drop to a floor renders it inoperable.,2021,11
"This is a nice mouse for the price. If you don't need extra buttons it's a good choice, especially if you want something that recharges rather than eating batteries.",2021,11
"Stopped working less than 24 hours after I received the package. It would cost me more to return it than what I paid for it, so it’s just sitting in my office, making clutter. Honestly, would not recommend it at all.",2021,11
"Contacted the seller about the battery not holding a charge , told me to plug it in .....  Sent it back.",2021,11
"Not really ergonomic but I don't have an underlying issue where this is a problem for me.  I love the color changing aspect.  Conversation piece and the charge lasts a couple of days.  I also turn it off when I leave so I really don't know how long it really lasts but I have not had any issues.  Its a mouse, if you want it, get it - if you don't, don't.",2021,11
Battery won't last. Unable to return since my return window close.,2021,11
"This is a nice, sleek little mouse. I'm very pleased with the size and the connection/range. I was looking for one that wasn't too clunky but still looked decent. This definitely fits the bill. All the awesome colors is just a plus for my own personal amusement, also if you don't want the lights all the time there is a setting for that too. Good little mouse for the price.",2021,11
No complaints,2021,11
I like the slim design and color.,2021,11
"The first one had a defective charging cord connector (very loose,) and the replacement sent promptly starts fine and gets steadily slower and more and more draggy and must be turned off and on again to start working normally.  Both were returned under warranty and won't be reordered again.  Neat but not good quality.",2021,11
When I leave the mouse alone for a couple of minutes and then start using it. The mouse is really slow l have trying everything to fix it. Need a new mouse now,2021,11
My mouse suddenly died. They were great at reaching out to me and resolving the problem. Highly recommended purchasing from them.,2021,11
" I rely really love this. I bought it few months ago and I wanted to give a review after some time. I am this every single day, all the day and with the lights on. It has 2 functions,... The first one is like On, snf the second is with lights. I love it, I charge it once every few weeks and it is so silent, I can use it doing my studies till midnight, no problem with the clicking. I can charge it with the USB, so I don't have to change a battery. After few months, my mouse is working sooo good and if it is not charged, then I can connect to USB and continue to work with it. Good investment!",2021,11
I thought it would work but after a week and second one I bought it won’t work.,2021,11
"Purchased in July. By November it would no longer charge. E-Mail to seller sent to address in the instructions would not go thru. G-Mail said that ""recipient server did not accept our requests to connect"".Would not buy from this seller ever again.",2021,11
"It’s all fun and cute at the beginning but after a month in a half (past my refund window) and it has stopped working. I tried charging it, NOTHING! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!",2021,11
"First 24 hours of having it I couldn't get it to charge and isnt usable while on the charging cord. Completely useless, do not buy this cheap junk. If there was a zero stars button it would be ticked.",2021,11
Excelente,2021,11
"Not battery operated, since it's led the charge lasts less than a month. With the 3"" tiny charging wire, you can't use while charging.Useless junk!",2021,11
"I like this mouse, however after one week of use the scroll wheel broke.",2021,10
My favorite thing about this mouse is how smooth it feels to the touch. The colors are a great addition and add to the experience of using it. It feels sleek as you move it on a mousepad and all other surfaces and textures. The customer service has been splendid. They replaced a mouse for me and helped answer questions when I inquired about getting a replacement usb receiver. They were a pleasure to communicate with. No complaints,2021,10
"This product is garbage I didn’t even get a charging cord! Oh and by the way, the mouse come out the box broken/not working!Returning and running to a better name brand!",2021,10
Batteries don't last long. Mouse is uncomfortable to use. Goes into sleep mode waaay too fast and has to be turned off and back on to reconnect it,2021,10
My laptop mouse was sticking ordered this bad boy does great and the battery life on this thing is unreal. It last a very long time. The lights super cute.,2021,10
Be very careful about leaving mouse plugged in.  Cord caught fire while using it plugged in.,2021,10
"This mouse feels good in the hand, looks cute as all get out but did not last a month.  After charging only once, I have had issues with it being sluggish and not holding a charge.",2021,10
The colors are bright and the mouse is lightweight. Their customer service is also amazing.,2021,10
Awesome,2021,10
"It would sometimes require extra force to register the click so definitely don't recommend it for gaming. The optics worked very well, so it's definitely a good normal use mouse.",2021,10
Product was easy to set up.  However only lasted a month.  Charging port broke after 2’weeks and was not able to get it to charge a few weeks after that.,2021,10
It does not hold it's charge for long..within 2 hours it's done. Also doesn't track well in comparison to my older wireless mouse. Going back to using it more often.,2021,10
This is the best mouse ever.  It is so responsive and rarely needs recharging.,2021,10
Barely worked for a few hours and died,2021,10
"Works, and the battery lasts a week or two with frequent use and charges easily. One less cord to get snarled in my laptop case, too.The lights around the edge seem silly, but do make it easy to keep track of it in the dark.Goes to sleep after a few minutes of nonuse, requires a mouse click to wake it up, a nuisance, but that means you need not bother to turn it off.Overall, very pleased.",2021,10
"Its a good mouse. Slim, quiet and the battery lasts forever on one charge. Its not very durable though so don't drop it. Luckily its snaps back in place if you do.",2021,10
Works great with my mac book pro!,2021,10
"Small, doesn't respond well",2021,10
This is not compatible with HP or google chrome devices.,2021,10
"Have Purchased 2 of them and both are not working after about 2 weeks, Changed batteries and still no luck , You get what you pay for",2021,10
Perfect no comment everything is pretty good,2021,10
"I plugged it in and let it charge over night, I was so excited to use it becuae I though it was so cute. DID NOT WORK FROM DAY 1When I turned the power on it would flash red, then I would try to use it and nothing - Zero - Zip- nothing would work.Waste of time buying it, waste of time trying to get it to work, and now waste of time having to return it. So very disappointed",2021,10
After bought a day later my daughter fell down and its not working now.,2021,10
This mouse is absolutely done and performed as stated by the seller. Smooth movement and quiet clicks. Virtually no sound and I love the light show it emits around the mouse. If you are looking for great quality and functionality look no further because here it is!!!,2021,10
Very slim easily fits in my laptop case. LED lights work great and add a fun touch to the mouse. No connection issues.,2021,10
"I enjoyed using the mouse while it lasted, but after 2 months of light use the scroll wheel collapsed. Mouse is still responsive, but scrolling no longer works which makes it practically useless to me.",2021,10
The plug to use in a MacBook does not work. I really needed this mouse so I had to go out and buy a plug myself spending more money for what this should have come with. It’s working now but only because I spent more money!!,2021,10
The scrolling mechanism stopped working within 20 minutes of use. I didn’t drop it or handle it improperly. It’s just a piece of junk.,2021,10
"The product is cheap and worked well for the first 2 months, but after that it started becoming unresponsive. I would plug it in because I thought it was low in power, but that didn't solve the issue either. I use a lap top and have a lap desk where it has a built in mouse pad area. I've had it for years so I was thinking it was too old and worn down and the mouse wasn't able to read it. So I bought a new 3M mouse pad, but still nothing. Tried updating drivers with various programs, tweaked a bunch of settings and followed the advice from several websites. Nothing. So I disconnected it and brought out my WIRED  mouse and it isn't working either! This product even disabled my track pad, but luckily I found a way to get it working. I blame this crap product, as it literally almost bricked my laptop",2021,10
"At first it felt cheap, but pretty much like all other. Perfect for what I needed.",2021,10
"After two months of non-regular use this mouse has already stopped working properly.  Scroll wheel has completely stopped working on it's own and now feels somewhat ""loose"" when touched.  Was good while it worked and liked the color of it but only two months of use is unacceptable when there are other similar priced options from other companies.",2021,10
"Very basic mouse, rechargeable battery that lasts awhile, great for just needing a simple wireless option at a good price.",2021,10
"I, especially, like that there are NO batteries.  It charges quickly.",2021,10
"I love this mouse!  It's smooth, quiet, and holds the charge.  So glad I purchased it!",2021,10
The sleep mode keeps you from having to charge very often. Feels good in my palm. Quiet click is nice. Works well.,2021,10
I bought it in April and by August it would no longer charge.,2021,08
"I really like this mouse. I love that it doesn't need batteries! You just charge it and it's ready to go. I did have a issue with my MacBook Pro when connecting the adapter for the receiver it comes with to my computer, it changed my scrolling ability on my laptop trackpad, and I wasn't able to scroll without using the mouse. I had to call Apple to figure out how to fix it and that's when I discovered removing the usb-c adapter the mouse comes with from my computer solved the problem. I have a usb-c to USB adapter from the Mac store, so I just used that for the mouse receiver and it worked perfectly, and it doesn't change my scrolling ability with the trackpad at all.",2021,10
After a month it will not hold a charge junk Have to keep it plugged up to use it,2021,10
"Constantly ""times out"" or goes to sleep, and every time I try to move it to use it again, it takes me having to sit there and shake it for ten seconds - at first, not a big deal, but do that for a few weeks, and it's incredibly frustrating. I went back to my old mouse. I'll know next time to pay for a better mouse.",2021,10
I have had this mouse for less than 8 weeks. . .it charges. . .doesn't work. At all. Go buy a name brand that will work for more than 15 minutes!,2021,10
"Inexpensive, but the quality matches those of way more expensive mouses!  Also, this mouse has led lights which is very nice.  I will definitely be recommending this to my friends!",2021,10
I like the ergonomic design of this mouse and so far I find it easy and smooth and to use. I can work on it all day long tiredlessly,2021,10
My son loves it!,2021,10
"I was wary of buying a no-name brand mouse, but it turned out to be even better than I expected. It’s super sleek and looks great with the LEDs. It also functions VERY well - the clicks are almost silent (if you’ve used a cheap mouse that has LOUD clicks you’ll know what I’m talking about, haha) and it’s very reactive. I use it for light gaming and it’s perfect. I haven’t even had to charge it yet, which is amazing. Absolutely worth it for the price!!",2021,10
It has already stopped working. The little roller on top stop working,2021,10
Its cute and comfortable but tracks too slowly for gaming,2021,10
The lights on the side of the mouse are not as bright as I thought they would be. But still like the mouse none the less. Quiet clicking. Charges quickly.,2021,10
Just love color,2021,10
"It's what I expected, accept they forgot to put the C adapter in the box. I bout 2 of them the other one had its adapter sooo.. 4 stars for being mostly right.",2021,10
"This mouse was wonderful when it worked, but it stopped after just over a month. It will not hold a charge and is of no use now. Unfortunately the return window has passed. I would not suggest purchasing this item.",2021,10
"As I've just learned by searching questions, after using it for a few weeks, the scroll wheel stops working. Also, these are silly lights for a grownup. They remind me of those kids' shoes that light up when they step. Green, pink, yellow lights are kid or gamer colors. Every time I try to save a buck I regret it. Off to buy a new one...",2021,10
Used a few hours a day for 6 weeks.  It is totally dead!,2021,10
Loved it until the wheel quit after five months,2021,10
"massive waste of money. plus, the red light was extremely bright and couldn't be turned off.",2021,10
"I was surprised how good this mouse, no regrets!",2021,10
Stopped working 2 months after I got it,2021,10
Okay,2021,10
Love it!,2021,10
Works well.,2021,10
"I used this mouse to play Minecraft and not long after I got it , I’d say a month, the mouse it started slowly malfunctioning. This is disappointing considering there were so many good reviews. Now I am in need of another mouse and I wish I could get my money back because I’m not made of money and thought this would last me a while.",2021,10
The wireless mouse with the USC and C size adapter is perfect. The LED lights are a great addition.,2021,10
"Is not the best i have try, but for the price works very good and is pretty accurate",2021,10
"This mouse is almost unusable because of how loud every scroll is. I took the top off to make sure there wasn't something stuck in there to create this awful sound and it was clean. Just poorly designed/cheap. I wasn't expecting the greatest mouse for this low price point, but this is just obnoxious.",2021,10
 I’ve only had the mouse for one month it no longer wants to charge. I have the matte black mouse and the Paint is peeling off.,2021,10
"This looks incredibly cheaply made, and if it drops off my desk I’m positive it will break immediately.",2021,10
"It was the best mouse until charge ran out and it refuses to get charged. It was pretty, dainty and lightweight while it lasted. For exactly a month. Now it’s trash. Of no use. Buy something a couple dollars more but atleast will last for months.",2021,10
Well the color is great but it stopped working after two uses . tryed to charge it and it doesn't even take a charge. Won't try anything from this vendor again.,2021,10
"Love this mouse. Purchased the mint green for laptop. Works great so far. Dongle was tight to remove but that's ok. Lights change color, make sure to put it on the setting that looks like a sun otherwise ""On"" position will leave lights on red. It was delivered when it was expected.",2021,10
 I bought one of these from this company and it stopped working within the first 2 weeks.I messaged the seller upset because I could not return. I thought maybe buying the “upgraded” version would be best option before making a large complaint because it was a nice mouse for the little time I was able to use it.Big mistake.The second one stopped working within 2 weeks of using it continuously.I can’t return if either to receive my money back or receive a replacement.It’s frustrating because of the fact that I work from home and need a mouse.I am going to make a complaint through Amazon itself. But i wanted to warn others not to waist your money.Good luck!,2021,10
"After one full charge And the charge running out, the battery won’t hold a charge. I’ll leave it plugged in for hours to charge, only for it to die in about 5 minutes of use. Definitely better products out there.",2021,10
"For the price, you can't complain - super low profile, LED lights, works really well, no lag.",2021,10
"After a day or 2, the mouse would not work at all. It was not a problem with the connection, my computer was able to pick up the Bluetooth no problem. THe mouse itself would not work unless it was plugged into some sort of charger....kind of defeats the purpose of a WIRELESS mouse.",2021,10
I just got this mouse and wanted to like it but it glitches so much. To get it to stop I have to turn it off then back on so I can continue working. Will be returning.,2021,10
Had it for one month and not working...,2021,10
Not great quality but it works fine & lights up,2021,10
"It worked fine for a month, today 3 days after the return policy window the cursor dosent work anymore and even with a change of batteries.",2021,10
"It's a cool mouse, the led features are nice and it's pretty, but I hate when I have to move it sporadically for a good 3-5 seconds before the mouse moves on the screen. I've tried different mouse pads, and it still happens. It's extremely frustrating, and it happens as soon as you stop using for any period of time and go back to using it. You have to left and right click numerous times before it will respond now. It also makes an irritating high-pitched noise when you move it.",2021,10
"I have now purchased 2 of these computer mice, both of which have broken and become unusable within just a few weeks. With the first one, I thought I got a defective item, so I returned it and got the same model again for exchange. Now that one has broken too, conveniently just 2 days outside the return window.  In both instances, the click wheel stopped functioning, making scrolling impossible. These were handled with care in my home office, and not used improperly, or dropped, or exposed to moisture, etc. They just seem very cheaply made. The LED lights were a nice feature but meaningless without a functioning mouse. As far as the ergonomics, I often found my hand hurting. The mouse is so low-profile as to be unnatural to hold or maneuver. I do not recommend this product.",2021,10
This mouse is unusable for someone who wishes to work efficiently. It tracks completely erratically and is simply not worth using.,2021,10
"Great item overall, but I wish it uses usb c to charge then micro usb.",2021,10
The mouse I got would make the pointer on the computer move without me moving the mouse and it constantly tried red even when it was on the rainbow setting and fully charged,2021,10
"Initially, I was pleased with the feel and performance of this mouse. It is lighter and slimmer than the typical usb wireless mouse, and it worked well. However, after about two weeks, the scrolling wheel became erratic and it stopped working altogether today, a bit more than three weeks in use. As a result, the mouse became essentially useless and I am returning it.",2021,10
"I love this mouse! It’s small and very quiet. The LED lights are a plus. I got the pink one and it couldn’t be any cuter!! Definitely will buy again, need one at home and work :)",2021,10
Good,2021,10
Works great on my desktop. Good battery life and sleep mode works seemlessly. Good value. Recommend.,2021,10
"It was very jittery on occasion, I went to replace it because it was a quick buy to get me by until I could afford a better solution. Solution. It served a purpose but I wouldn't recommend the purchase if you could avoid it.",2021,10
Not a fan. Have had better for cheaper.,2021,10
The mouse works better then expected. The battery life has exceeded a week so far. If you have a Surface Go2 this mouse will not disappoint. Very happy with this item. Would recommend.,2021,10
"It worked great for 4 weeks, it’s quiet but it stopped working after the window to return closed. It doesn’t charge anymore. Money not well spent.I went back to my old one, never fails.",2021,10
recently started traveling for work and need a good mouse for my laptop to travel withthis does the job and doesn't break the bank i highly recommend,2021,10
Had this mouse less than a week. My kids knocked it off my desk. The mouse broke in half and will not snap back together. Has no durability! Save your money and buy a more reputable brand. My prior mouse was dropped dozens of times with no issues. Will be ordering one from that brand. This one is not worth the money.,2021,10
This stopped working after a month. Even after charging it won’t turn on.,2021,10
Worked flawlessly for a few days then the left button became  unreliable. Not worth the hassle to return.Update: Seller emailed me saying that they had corrected the problem and offered a refund if I took down this review. I replied I'd rather have a corrected unit which I would then review. They replied they weren't fixed yet and offered to 2x my refund. I ignored it.,2021,10
I do you like it so far but it started to come apart at the seam !!  I put it together a bit concerned If it's going to just do this again Must be due to quality I have been very careful with it,2021,10
"I bought this yesterday to replace a broken mouse. Day 1, has incredibly noticeable lag. I fully charged it before using it. It runs about the same as a turtle stuck in syrup. This isn't worth $15, just buy a different mouse.Update: The brand behind this sent me an email from a shady address claiming to be ""Amazon Custom Service"" and offered me $20 to delete the review. Not a chance. I urge you to stay away from this brand, they're shady af. They'll try to scam you after you buy their scummy product.",2021,10
This product doesn’t work as it should. I literally have to hold the Type C port into my MacBook for it to stay on.,2021,10
Excellent mouse,2021,10
"Ergonomics are great. Quality is okay, very lite weight and made of cheap plastic. Mouse pointer seems jumpy at times for no reason.All in all I would probably spend a little more money if you can or want to so that you get a better quality device.",2021,10
"I really loved this mouse, but 4 months in and it's not working. It lights up, but does not function with my laptop. I'm super disappointed!",2021,10
" While the product looks great, it’s not very ergonomic for me. Noticed pain in my hands after only a few days of usage. Not great for long period usage.",2021,10
"Although we had a quality issue with one of the laces, the vendor fixed our problem and replaced the damaged laces. Happy to give it another shot and hope we have better luck this time!",2021,10
"My return date closed 6 days ago, and the mouse has stopped working completely.",2021,10
After one month and 5 days it stopped turning on. Work fine until it just stop. Left it charging for hours still no luck.,2021,10
Has worked great until now.  I charged it and now it won't turn back on.  Can't return it either.  Not worth the money.,2021,10
It is not response at all. It is very jerky and doesn’t react for several seconds. I have used several cordless mice before but this gets the thumbs down.,2021,10
"Update 02.24.2022: I'm not sure why, but this mouse is working better than it did when I originally purchased it back in October 2021.  I use it EVERY DAY and I don't mind charging it over night every couple of days or so.  It IS comfortable to use, and kind of funky (in a good way) to use the changing lights feature from time to time.  Naturally, this will make the battery run down faster, but once in a while I enjoy the light show...  LOL and I love how the ""click"" is SO QUIET!They say they've upgraded this product so I hope you'll give it a try too.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review October 2021:  My use of this mouse consists of following:6 hours of use (without the pretty little alternating lights on) and then it's switched off for the night.Before my next 6 hours are over, this thing runs out of life and must be charged again.I'm not at all thrilled with it.It does have a nice quiet click, but if I have to charge it every time I use it, I don't think it will last very long....",2021,10
Its worth the price. Really good quality. Easy to install. Very smooth and works perfect. Highly recommend it.,2021,10
Loved the color and the slimness of it. Charging chord came looking like a dog chewed on it.,2021,10
Wire is broken within a month. I contacted seller and got refund immediately. Now they are changing vendor to get a good quality wire.,2021,10
"My younger don first bought this mouse for his Mac mini. Since then we fell in love with it and my wife bought this for her work laptopIt’s nice to get the customization of color and also very ergonomic in use and effective in performanceWe use this mouse in all kinds of setting - desk, lap, bed and even in cars..Never had issuesAwesome and looking forward to 3rd one to buy!!!!",2021,10
Love it but the girls at work lost my charging cord any ideas where i can get another cord other then that this mouse is awesome fast shipping just over all great,2021,10
Mouse works great when you first plug it in but if you wait a few minutes it will lag so much your better off using the laptop mouse. I’m disappointed in these high reviews because mine does not work.,2021,10
Work very well and easy to set up ! You can charge it with your computer the best thing is no need for batteries,2021,10
"It looks nice. But after two months, it did not work anymore. The cursor did not move, even it was fully charged.NOT recommend it.",2021,10
I received this and tried to use it and it lags all over the computer screen. It is horrible. It’s very pretty but does not work. Even tried to charge it for two entire days and still lags.,2021,10
The cursor acts erratically and the left and right buttons respond poorly. One must work twice as hard to use this than any other mouse I have ever had. Seek elsewhere - go to a local store where you can easily return the thing if you need to.,2021,10
"People always ask me about my mouse when I use it at school. Love the colors, love that its rechargeable. Its small and lightweight so its great for what I use it for which is with my laptop at school/in the lab. I've already dropped it a few times and it still works. No complaints.",2021,10
Love everything about it.,2021,10
"I am very disappointed in this mouse. while using it, the mouse will constantly stop working and I will have to turn it off and on just to get it to work again. This happens at least 3 times a day. As well, the battery life is not long at all. If I do not charge it every night, it will not work in the morning. Avoid!",2021,10
It is quiet and works well.  I am very happy with the purchase.,2021,10
This mouse only stayed charged for 2 hours if that long. Not very helpful when working 8 hours a day.,2021,10
"The mouse checks all my needs: wireless,  low profile, and inexpensive.I used to have a roller ball mouse but found myself having to frequently clean the ball from lint and dirt so this is a vast improvement.I've used this for a few days now and haven't had to charge it yet so so far so solid.",2021,10
"I wanted to just like it . I mean it worked. But, honestly, it felt like a kids cheap dollar tree toy. I just can’t imagine that it will last long. I should have known better, with the price. Anyway, I returned it.",2021,10
Doesn’t hold a charge for very long,2021,10
"The mouse is not large enough, and does not hold a charge for long.",2021,10
"Dissatisfied , darn thing stopped working",2021,10
Sadly it is not working.,2021,10
Product was great for the first two months. It suddenly just stopped working even though its fully charged. Kinda of a disappointment.,2021,10
Had this mouse for a month and the wheel already stopped working,2021,10
"I purchased this in July and it worked perfectly. It's now ""ass backwards"" You have to hold the button down just in order to move the cursor. If I let go of the button  IT DOES NOTHING. Its completely off track. The LED only works when it's charging. Before it worked whenever it was on the last switch  on the bottom of the mouse.",2021,10
I followed the instructions to the letter and it was slow and laggy.,2021,10
"I bought this mouse specifically for its price and slim profile. I wanted something small and compact that is easy to pack in my laptop bag. This fits the bill.This mouse is perfect for everyday use such as going to websites, using office applications like word, excel and powerpoint etcI would not recommend the mouse for gaming purposes, and that is not what it is meant for anyway.If you want a mouse that works for web browsing/office work on the go, looks nice and is slim and compact get this device!",2021,10
First one was defective.. Seller was fast to send a replacement.  Works with no issue.,2021,10
Color.,2021,10
"I play a lot of pc games and I really enjoy the quiet clicking compared to my old, very loud mouse",2021,10
you get what you pay for this thing is a piece of crap.,2021,10
"This is a very nice mouse for the price. The charge in the battery lasts a long time and the mouse buttons make almost no noise whatsoever. Perfect for use during a lecture at school when you don’t want to disturb the speaker with incessant clicking noises. I’m not sure how this would be for gamers, but the switchable DPI is a very nice feature, as well.Also, I do feel that I should point out that the RGB lights are switchable on and off, which is a nice feature if you are like me and are in a class where the room goes dark for presentations and video clips.",2021,10
I bought this mouse back in July to use with my laptop when I was in class. This would equate to a few hours each week. The mouse stopped working after about a month and I charged it overnight. The blue light never turned off and now the mouse will not turn on or work at all. Such a bummer because I really liked everything about it.,2021,10
I only use this mouse about 10 hours a week and it has already broke. It won’t turn on or charge. You get what you pay for.,2021,10
"Alot of people said the mouse was loud, didnt work, or what ever else, its FALSE the mouse is super quiet, my mouse at work is loud and obnoxious, this isnt. The colors are great i was sad cause it didnt turn pink lol but that is my only complaint. Its a great mouse, some of yall expect way too much from something cheep. You get what you pay for but this mouse is great!",2021,10
then it continued to be a cheap piece of junk. I mean I should have known from the price it was to good to be true. I never got it to charge or do anything. Returned.,2021,10
"didn't last, it stopped working already",2021,10
"Noiseless, very light, and comfortable mouse. But... There was a card in the same box saying  ”if you will write a review, we will return the money spent on the mouse”. That's not true!!! I spent time going through this process for nothing! Do not believe them! I was disappointed.",2021,10
Nice,2021,10
It moves well and I like that I can turn it off if I’m not using it.,2021,10
Ergonomic,2021,10
"When I first received the mouse it worked well and I enjoyed the multi-colors.  However, after 1 month it constantly needed to be charged.  By three months it no longer cycled the different colors, but was only red.  Now at the 7 month mark it no longer tracks, I move the mouse but my cursor doesn't move on the screen.  I've never had a mouse go bad this quickly.  I will not be purchasing this mouse again.",2021,10
This mouse has been great. Super quiet when you click and responds well when prompted. The lights add a nice touch and remind you to turn it off for the day!,2021,10
"Worked great at first, but now the right click button does nothing.  I am back to my track pad.  Avoid this device, cheap components",2021,10
"I purchased this item in August. The USB plug completely fell apart, and I can no longer use the mouse.",2021,10
I have no complaints about this mouse. I use it daily and it works great. I love the fact it has LED lights. I recommend this product.,2021,10
The mouse is slim which is nice. It seems to be made of a thinner plastic which feels flimsy. But over all it's pretty good for the price,2021,10
"The mouse never worked, I am very disappointed.",2021,08
"I wasted my money on buying two of these wireless led mouse.  They literally only lasted one week.  I charged them, the only activity is a prompt red flashing light.  I purchased a high end, well name brand wireless mouse.",2021,10
The box was torn and there is a scratch/ smudge on it.  I hope it works well.The colors are beautiful though.  I love how the white mouse looks.  It's very clean.  4 stars because of the smudge I can't get off and packaging.  It's obvious I'm not the first one to own it.,2021,10
The charging port is terribly built only worked for a month,2021,10
For a year the mouse did well however it eventually needed charged in less time frames  It finally shorted out. This was my 2nd purchase after the first shorted out within a few weeks. A permanent sleep mode!,2021,10
"Got the mouse hooked up and at first it didn't work. Light up but rgb function and connection to pc didn't work. Figured out it needed to sit and fully charge for everything to work. Mouse was doing great until I found a issue with its sleep mode. When the mouse falls asleep to save battery, it wakes up very quickly. However from that point on its control over the cursor becomes delayed. It's ping is tripled and you can watch the cursor stick and then start to move again while moving the mouse. I turned the mouse off and back on again to resolve this problem. So the sleep feature on this mouse is terrible. Have to turn it on and off as needed.",2021,10
"I bought these for my classroom, I have Sixteen total. They are constantly connecting to each others receivers and some just losing connection and not reconnecting after sleep mode. I think it's a good office mouse for anyone who isn't using it in a setting where a lot of them are being used. Do not buy if you need more than one.",2021,10
"It needs to be charged daily, as I use it all day at work. I do like the color changing light, it brightens up my day!",2021,10
It does what it’s supposed to do… Works as a wireless mouse. Beautiful color and works like a charm.,2021,10
"Good product, timely shipping.",2021,10
It doesn’t work correctly connection is bad,2021,10
"This is a very nice product. The mouse does not need a pad, can work on the bare desk, on a sheet of paper, etc. My device does not have multiple LEDs, only red (or the software I use does not employ all its features) but there is no need to complain. Will buy again without hesitation.",2021,10
I got this for my daughter for school. It is perfect and appeals to her teenage likes,2021,10
Worst wireless mouse I have ever purchased.  The lag time to respond to movement is horrble.  Clicking is even worse.  Sometimes I have to click three or four times before the mouse works.  I tried on multiple systems just to be sure it was not an issue with one laptop.  Do not purchase.  A complete waste of money and time.,2021,10
I really wanted to like this mouse as it’s lightweight and cute but it’s not worth it when the mouse charge dies quickly and since it’s not compatible with my MacBook I can’t use it while charging since I have to use the same adapter for both sensor and charging. Also lights stopped changing colors and you can’t set to one color.,2021,10
"I loved this mouse. It was slick and easy to use. However it was not once I used on a regular basis. I only used it may 1 hour max each day. The charge did not hold and here I am, less than a year in and it no longer holds a charge.  I tried to return but not accepted.",2021,10
"This mouse is terrible. Super glitchy. The mouse clicks on things your not clicking on, you put the curser on something and go to click it and it glitches and clicks something else. Not recommend",2021,10
Easy to use.  I was hoping the mouse would be taller.  Works ok,2021,10
"It works, and it’s cheap so there’s that. Not a great mouse by any means, but then again it was also like $10 so I’m not mad",2021,10
"A month after use and after a charge or two, the mouse is not longer usable. The battery is completely dead and will not charge. Completely unusable and a waste.",2021,10
"Nice low silhouette and quiet action. Does what is expected of a mouse and is good looking to boot. Obviously cannot judge it’s ergonomic qualities from such a short term of usage, but it appears to be no strain at all on my wrist and fingers. Holds a charge well. The only caveat I might mention is that the dongle is a bit too short for if you’re using while charging, but that is a minor issue. Well pleased with this mouse.",2021,10
"Works great, rechargeable, and pretty for my girls 😊",2021,10
Regularly stops tracking movement into a disjoint and jerky cursor movement. Seems to depend on the color of the surface underneath (based on my multicolor mousepad).OEM harassed me with emails about changing my review. Amazon leaked my email that was only given to Amazon.,2021,10
I work from home and have to run more than one screen and this mouse was amazing when I bought it. Now it has decided that it doesn’t want to charge and is currently useless after only 5 week. I was about to buy another one for my mom but have canceled it now since this one has stopped working. It sucks because it’s such a fun mouse. It also never leaves my home office so I know it’s not from packing or moving it around a lot,2021,10
"The mouse is ergonomically comfortable and I like the cool lights. However, difficult to enjoy these features when the mouse doesn’t work. The first one had a defective left click button. I ordered a replacement because I really wanted to like this mouse. I got the replacement and less than two weeks later, the scroll wheel stopped working.",2021,10
This is just the second day since I got this mouse for my laptop and it doesn't work anymore. I LOST MY MONEY,2021,10
Convenient and quiet mouse,2021,10
At home for personal use,2021,10
Battery life is terrible and mouse stops working from time to time. No idea how this product has such high reviews.,2021,10
"Just literally snap in usb and go. Easy to hold, light weight, lights up, perfect all around design. Quality is excellent. Just what I needed in a mouse!",2021,10
Works great!,2021,10
Everything,2021,10
Recommend it!,2021,10
Cheap and awful product,2021,10
"It looks good, feels good, but won't hold a charge for even 20 minutes.",2021,10
surprized it had a charger  happy,2021,10
"There  was nothing I disliked about this mouse, it is very nice",2021,10
I purchased this mouse to replace the corded mouse in my office.  I have used it for a little over a week now and am completely satisfied with the way it works and how my hand feels.  Ergonomically speaking it is so much better than the standard chunkier mouses I've used most of my professional career.  My hand is in a resting position while using it and remains free from stress and strain. LOVE IT!,2021,10
"It works perfectly in my MacBook proupdate: now it does not work anymore, very disappointed",2021,10
"I will quickly touch on the star ranking then get into it. Ergonomics, feels good in my hand at first but after a few minutes you start to realize something is off. It’s a little too small for extended use. But hey, that’s personal preference. For the couple hours I did use this thing The sleep mode worked. I did zero gaming with it because the basic task of trying to pull up Netflix and Hulu was a nightmare. The quiet click is top notch. I’d give that 5 outta 5.So I’ve had glitchy mice before and it was annoying but could deal with it for a little bit. They might twitch a little or maybe vibrate some when the mouse wasn’t being used. But this thing full jumps across the screen and not even in the right direction always. I use a split screen and i open Netflix on the left screen and it pops up open on the right. When I move the mouse to the right it starts to move then jumps and ends up all the way back to the left. It also lags every once in a while and sometimes you put the mouse over something. Leave it there for a second to make sure you are on what you want to click on and when you click it actually clicks on 2 rows above where I was (this was on Netflix’s). This is a nightmare of a mouse. Do Not Buy! Its a cheap mouse but not even the cheapest option. You can buy a cheaper mouse that functions properly. The LED lights did work just fine for me. The next morning I went back to using my mouse that is duct taped together until I can get another one.",2021,10
"Have been using the Wireless Mouse now for a few months and it is a Great purchase.  After charging, it works for days; also the speed is fantastic!  I would highly recommend buying item.",2021,10
"Just like the title says, died out of nowhere 20 days after the return window and warranty were up. I tired it on two PCs and one laptop. It still lights up, but won't connect. JUNK!",2021,10
Mouse was very light and would t keep a charge. Adapter broke a week after I got it.,2021,10
Doesn't hold charge very long.  Hard to click - use.  Stopped working all together.  Have gone back to wired mouse.  Much easier to use.,2021,10
This mouse is wonderful and easy to use without a mouse pad which is a big plus. Bought this to replace my old wireless mouse because the usb plug is shorter and does't stick out the side of my laptop to far. It is rechargeable and lasts for a while thanks to the sleep function which is easy to exit from. Love that you can choose to have it light up and changes colors. Totally worth the buy!,2021,10
Used this mouse for a week and the scroll roller is already broken.,2021,10
I hate this mouse. Doesn’t stay charged and sleep mode kicks in too quickly,2021,10
"I was impressed with the first 2 I’ve bought for my boys, had to get a 3rd for myself. No problems connect mouse to my laptop, love the lights on it. Easy to glide, easy to use",2021,10
"Good price, funky colors, clearly starts stuttering in response time when it's ready to be charged. Perfect for my tiny home-office kitchen counter space!",2021,10
"I got this mouse for a friend, and he loved it. Very sleek and the colors just overall look amazing. Awesome purchase!",2021,10
"After 2 weeks it just completely stopped working. Tried 4 different chargers and nothing. It was a good price and loved the lights, but should have just grabbed one from the dollar store if this is the quality of the product😑",2021,10
"Came ready to use, starting using straight from box. It is convenient, and ergonomic friendly.",2021,10
Of course 2 weeks after return window closes the mouse stops working. Slow movement and doesn’t respond to commands. Waste of plastic.UPDATE: Seller offered to make this right.  Awaiting final resolution,2021,10
I like this wireless mouse for now. Hoping nothing goes wrong with it. So far it's been very dependable and works correctly. The design is perfect and I love the different colors. It works the moment you connect the USB connector to the computer and turn the mouse on. The only thing I don't like is how quickly it goes into sleep mode. But that's not too big of an annoyance.,2021,10
"The mouse just feels odd in my hand. It's serviceable, but when it dies I'm not buying another.",2021,10
After 2 months of using this mouse it just stopped working out of nowhere and it’s fully charged. Also experience the random jumping of the cursor before it left this life and went to mouse heaven. Would no recommend.,2021,10
"I love that it change colors. It’s sleek, and easy to control. I will most definitely order another one.",2021,10
It is NOTHING like it’s advertised!! I’ve charged it… then it wouldn’t work… so I charged it again… and it’s STILL not doing anything!!!! I’m so aggravated!! 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻😤😤😤,2021,10
It’s nice not to have to worry about replacing batteries.,2021,10
Just what I needed and I like the colors. Real sleek in hand,2021,10
"***Update 12/10/21*** This mouse is garbage. I wrote my review after one day of good functionality, but the rechargeable battery seems to only last one day before it starts being jerky and responding inconsistently, buttons don't always work when I click something. If I take out the USB and turn on/off the mouse it fixes it for a few minutes until it goes into sleep mode. The first one they sent me didn't work at all and this new one just doesn't work. It works better if the mouse is plugged in but the cord is short and stiff. Ordering something else.The mouse works great for my Dell laptop. Fits comfortably, sleek profile, no problems. The button is still audible but quieter than my last mouse. I had an issue with my first shipment, but customer service was very responsive, problem-solved with me, and then shipped me a new mouse very quickly.",2021,10
"This mouse is good for its price. Its light, and the clicking mechanism is actually quite nice. When you press down it's more of a subtle, soft click which I like a lot, rather than an annoying and loud click. However, it does feel a little cheap when you hold it and quality of the plastic is pretty low. When using the LED mode you can practically see inside the mouse. Once again though, for $15, it's not bad! I like it because I can connect it to my Macbook air too, which uses an USB-C.",2021,10
"I love the sleek design of this mouse.  My favorite aspect, though, is the quiet clicking - the noise is muted and that is an unexpected bonus!",2021,10
Beyond what I expected bought 2 more,2021,10
It works great. Smooth and quiet. Comfortable and fun,2021,10
Basic mouse at a reasonable price.,2021,10
"Broke after one month, went to plug it in and the charging port pushed way back inside the mouse and when I opened the mouse up to fix it the piece had busted off completely.",2021,10
" In all honesty, there is very little practical value added by colorful light changes for a mouse, but you know what?  In this time of the pandemic, we can all use a bit of quirky and interesting little patches of fun and joy -- especially visually.  This little mouse (I got the gold color because it was the least expensive at the time) always brings a smile.  Btw, it IS quiet -- no noisy clicks, the color is beautiful and classic, and the feel is very ergonomic and no stress on the hand and fingers. If you're still on the fence -- get one (or more) if you want to give yourself a little (and very useful) treat.",2021,10
I've had this about a month and it's struggling to hold a charge and the mouse is jumping. There is also no option to return!! I'll be going back to a regular battery operated one as rechargeable is just not reliable. Dissapointed!,2021,10
"I work from home and in the office.  I have to transport my laptop and mouse.  I have forgotten my mouse more time that I can remember at the office.  I bought 2 of these so I can keep 1 at home and 1 at the office.  They only hold a charge for less than a week.  It might have to do with it having lights on it, but my other mouse holds a charge of heavy usage for a month.  Will not buy again as I need something to hold a charge much longer.",2021,10
Exactly what I was looking for. Sleek and quiet and also pretty with the lights! You can turn the rainbow lights off if you don’t want them on.,2021,10
"I was used to buying name brand 'mouses'.  And I was worried about the size of this device. But actually its a good size just with a lower profile.  Works very well and sleeps and wakes up when you push the button on top.  The lighting is nice, not real bright but just a strip around the outside and the button lights up.  Changes color which is a nice touch.  So I actually like it better than the other larger mouses I have.",2021,10
"You get what you pay for. If you just need a quick mouse on the go so you don’t need a touch pad, this is great. Enduring use of everyday mouse, spend the money for one that is lightweight, ventilated, ergonomic, or a combination. This one, soft clicks, decent feedback, good battery. Just not super high quality for the desk job",2021,10
This broke after 3 weeks.poorly put together.,2021,10
When I use it the pointer jumps around alot.,2021,09
"So I bought two different mouse to use, one for my laptop and one for my pc. The originally bought this one for my desktop to match my RGB but I enjoy using it with my laptop much better. It is the perfect size for my hand. You cannot go wrong at this price for what you get! I enjoy the noiseless aspect and the light weight feel.",2021,09
Bought the rose gold one to match my laptop and while it's not a perfect match it's still very pretty and I love the lights! It is a very silent when clicking and very responsive when moving the mouse.Update:So I received this mouse exactly 10 days ago and the scroll button is broke. I went to try to take it apart to fix it and even with the correct size screwdriver (Very small btw) it just stripped the screw because it was so tightly screwed in. so not only did my brand new less than 2 week old mouse break they made it impossible to fix it by making a fort nox screw. not happy save your money.,2021,09
"It does everything I ordered it to do for a good price. rechargeability is a huge plus to me for a wireless mouse, the clicks are satisfying, and it feels nice to hold. My only gripe is that the lights on it are a bit weak, but I honestly don't care about that in the slightest and that's not why I bought it so it's not a big deal.",2021,09
"PERFECT,  no complaints. Super cute color changes. I never charge it and it's only died once and I use it for work about 10 hours a day and seems like I charge it like 2 times a week.",2021,09
waste of your money,2021,09
I liked this mouse for comfort and look. The roller ball literally fell into the mouse rendering the entire mouse useless 7 months after I purchased it. Disappointing.,2021,09
"I loved it, at first. But the mouse started making a squeaking noise when I used the roller. It was very annoying in class.",2021,09
"Worst mouse ever. It double clicks when I do not want it to. The mouse barely moves and is jerky when used and often makes the cursor slide to the upper right of the screen, without me moving the mouse.",2021,09
Sleek Looking with lights but scroller on one did not work.,2021,09
Worked great after first charge then became choppy and uncontrollable. Very disappointed in this mouse.,2021,09
My mouse has stop working already. I had the mouse for two months and already it has stop working. This was a waste of money.,2021,09
I have two problems. No matter how long you charge it for it’s dead in an hour. That’s if it been works.  The usb plug in takes two people to get out and I’m afraid it will get stuck and ruin my computer.  The appearance is great but it doesn’t work and could break the USB port. Because of this I do not recommend.Since this posted the company offered 40$ To change review instead of just sending another mouse. Clearly they know there product does not work.,2021,09
"Great product, excellent seller! Thank you!!!",2021,09
Mac book pro mouse never worked. Money refunded,2021,09
"This mouse is very cheaply made and did not function properly right out of the box. It will move the cursor around and scroll, but it will not click on anything, right or left click. Ridiculous! I want to return it, but the hassle of dealing with it isn’t worth getting the money back since it was so cheap to begin with. Should have known to go for a more expensive and reputable brand like Logitech!",2021,09
"After just three months, this mouse no longer charges. So, it's useless. Spend a few extra dollars and get a better mouse.",2021,09
wheel broke inside from minimal use; unable to put back on so the scrolling option no longer works.,2021,09
"It was so pretty for the first few hours after charging with the changing lights and standby light mode.  Then the next morning after turning it off, it would not turn back on, so I put it on the charging cord... for DAYS!!! and nope nothing.... Save your money and purchase something else and make sure it takes batteries.  This is garbage that has a pretty face on it.  If i still had the box it came in I would be getting a full refund and send it back.",2021,09
"This mouse doesn't work on 90% of surfaces, including my mouse pad, it's also slow and laggy.",2021,09
Very frustrated and upset! I had it exactly for 31 days and out of it I used 5 times and it already stopped working. Save YOUR money!,2021,09
I loved the simplicity of this product! Super sleek and in a color that matched my laptop. Would recommend to anyone looking for a minimalist design. Just look at how it matches with my setup!,2021,09
Enjoy the mouse.,2021,09
"I needed a mouse for my laptop. For around the same price as a ""big name"" mouse you can get a mouse that works just as well. And looks cool with it's LED lights. And it's rechargeable. The lights can be switched off if they are too distracting but i admit I like them. It isn't quite as ergonomic as some mice but it fits nicely into my laptop bag.  USB receiver is small enough to leave in my laptop without it getting yanked out.",2021,09
I like the look and feel of this mouse. It is clean and fits my hand well. My complaint is with the working of it. After only 2-1/2 months the scroll wheel has quit working. About 4 weeks ago it began with the cursor jumping when I pulled down on the wheel but now it only barely works. I pull down on the wheel and either nothing happens at all or the line on the page jumps down one line and then stops altogether. I will see if I can get it fixed or replaced but this was a new item and should have worked a year or more without issues. It makes me very sad.,2021,09
Piece of junk. Stopped working after 1 day. Now the only way for the cursor to move is if you hold down the right mouse button. How is that even possible? Did the mouse rewire itself? Not sure how this product is so highly rated.,2021,09
The scroll wheel doesn’t work,2021,09
I love this mouse. It fits my hands perfect. I use it a lot and haven't had any problems.,2021,09
"I have purchased this mouse twice and each time it has phased out on me after about 2-3 months of use. It stopped holding a charge and I cold only use it while it was plugged in which defeats the meaning of wireless. Then it completely went out on me and I can no longer use the mouse at all even when it is on the charging cable. I have gone through the customer reviews looking for fixes and nothing.Update: Now I'm being offered money to remove my comment. $40-45. No I will not. I can care less about my money back I want what I paid for and a refund shouldn't be contigent upon removing my comment. Again, don't buy.",2021,09
The mouse itself still works but the USB port has just broken in a million pieces. My laptop stays at home and it is what I use as my home computer. After about a month of use the USB port is just the piece that pushes into the laptop and the plastic tip is just gone. One more break and it will either be stuck in my computer or I will be unable to use the mouse.,2021,09
"Was a great mouse until it stopped working, which was less than 2 months after I purchased it.  It was used and charged as per instructions, then it suddenly stopped functioning all together.  Would not purchase again, because even with its low cost, it's not worth it to only get 2 months use out of it.  Do not recommend.",2021,09
"It works well looks pretty and very smooth to use, good buy",2021,09
"i think this mouse is great! I love the LED colors changing. It goes to sleep after a little while to save battery life. It's very simple to charge if it ever needs it. My only thing about it (and it's not even negative about the device) is that my hands are very big so this seems a little tinier than I'd like. Still though, I got no complaints about it.",2021,09
"Bought this mouse for work because I didn't want to use the corded mouse my company gave me.Not even two months in, the mouse scroller BREAKS. Never dropped the mouse, never did anything but charge it twice a week and use it for work. Had to overnight ship a completely different mouse for work the next day. Very disappointed because I really liked the mouse and I had even told my coworkers to buy this. I'm glad they didn't waste their money like I did...",2021,09
Bought this for my husband. He was very pleased with it. Works just fine and comes as described.,2021,09
The design is pretty but the functionality is crappy. My mouse censor keeps glitching in and out which makes it impossible to work with. Definitely will be returning which is really annoying because it took forever to arrive and it was supposed to be a replacement for my previous wireless mouse that fell to its death from the 2nd floor last week.,2021,09
"For the money, this mouse is a great value! I needed a new mouse, as the click on my old brand name mouse was begging to ""miss"".  I wanted something fairly inexpensive, wireless and rechargeable. I am tired of having to switch out batteries. This mouse fit all those perfectly.  My first month impression is .. it's excellent.  After the initial charge, it's still going strong with maybe an hour a day usage, after 3 weeks.  It goes to ""sleep"" after a period of inactivity, which helps to conserve the battery.  My only gripe, would be the slim profile.  I think I prefer a little more bulk in my palm.  My only contact with the mouse when navigating, is with my fingers, no palm contact.  This does not deduct from my rating as it is clearly advertised as a slim profile design.  All in.. I am glad I purchased this mouse.  If this company develops a full contoured model, I would surely upgrade.",2021,09
Poor quality. Cheap. Breaks quickly. Doesn’t last long on a full charge. Charging port already broke.,2021,09
"At first I really loved this mouse - fast connection and worked well. But like several other reviews mentioned, after about 8-9 months, it just stopped working. It didn’t charge or anything, it just literally stopped working. For that alone, I would rate it a bad pedi to because it doesn’t last. I didn’t drop it or beak it, it simply stopped working.",2021,09
Not well made.  Very light and flimsy. Returned it.,2021,09
Great,2021,09
"It won’t charge at all, two weeks after I bought it and it’s already useless. The blue light turns off like it’s charged but it’s totally dead. Tried different cables and it just doesn’t work",2021,09
"Pros:Surprisingly, the battery charge lasts me a looooong time. I think it lasted me a month on one charge!!!One of the cheapest in the market.Cons:The first one i got didn’t work.The replacement one worked but sometimes the scroll is backwards.",2021,09
"Despite the description saying it was Macbook compatible it wasn’t. I have the Macbook Air with the M1 chip. Regardless, it’s a nice mouse and it’s quite as described and does work on PC. I was able to test it on my PC.",2021,09
"The item is actually nice. The size, color and lights are very cute. And I love that is rechargeable. The only issue I encounter was that when you leave it idle for a few seconds and then try to use it, it gets super slow and lags. I have to turn it off and back on to have the speed back to normal. I don't know if that is a feature to save power, or if mine is defective. I'll try to reach out to the seller. Has anyone else experienced this issue?",2021,09
Battery won’t stay charged very long,2021,09
stagnant mouse movement. dont buy this if you use your mouse often.,2021,09
"On day 3, the mouse doesn’t seem to be tracking well. It behaves like it’s on an uneven surface (mouse gets stuck for half a second as your moving it, then jumps) despite being on a completely smooth surface. The build quality seems very poor.",2021,09
Came and broke writhing one day it was dropped one foot and broke.,2021,09
Broke as soon as it dropped on the floor.,2021,09
This is a total waste of money as it stopped working after two weeks. So dissappointed with this product.,2021,09
I ordered TWO and within a one time use neither one of them works any longer. What kind of a horrid product is this company supplying a company like AMAZON with? AND they are not cheap by any means!!So disappointed in Amazon allowing this product to be sold on their site. I have never been so distraught with any of my purchases with Amazon EVER - BUT THIS ONE really places shame on Amazon.I would like full replacement for both because I have TWO work PCS for my job; one for the USA and another PC for accounts out of the country (Latin America) - that was the purpose for purchasing two.,2021,09
Good mouse for my laptop. Great feel and comfortable!,2021,09
easy to use,2021,09
I love it 😍,2021,09
"The first day it worked great, but the second day it barely tracks at all and when I try and click on anything to open documents or emails, it takes several tries before it works!!What a waste of money, I'm going back to my old mouse!!!",2021,09
"I loved this mouse until it quit working, three weeks after using. I am unable to return it due to return window. Tried different mouse pads and notebooks hoping I was just the material it was sensitive to.",2021,09
Sucks. Broke in 1 month,2021,09
Mouse is generic and seems like it worked a couple of times then it was just never working good after that.,2021,09
This wireless mode has a nice sleek design. I purchased the matte design. I love that the clicks are quieter than others. I didn’t think It mattered that much but it does. No problems with cursor speed or connectivity. I enjoy the change of colors. Feels more expensive than it actually is. Excellent price!,2021,09
"I bought this mouse a few months ago, and the USB receiver broke. However, I contacted the seller about the issue, and they sent me a new mouse, at no cost.",2021,09
Thé mouse sucks. Only worked 1 day after that it never worked again. Never buying it again.,2021,09
I absolutely love how vibrant the lights are and how light weight the mouse is. I work from home and use this alot.,2021,09
If you had that I've never ending need to have a wireless mouse that has led colors on it that needs to be constantly plugged in for it to work then this is for you.  The charge on it will last approximately 7 hours before it's dead.  If you turn off the pretty lights then maybe it will last 12 hours.  Really not a functional wireless mouse.  Don't buy it.,2021,09
"I wouldn't recommend this mouse, the USB adapter came apart from the computer its JUNK.",2021,09
"This wireless mouse is a good size with great compatibility with my mac. It's a great price, and color matches my cover. Highly recommend for those that just need an everyday mouse :)",2021,09
worrks well,2021,09
"This mouse worked well for a while (3-4 months) but now it is very unreliable. I switched USB ports, got an extender thinking the connector was blocked by my metal desk. 🤷‍♀️That helped some, but it lags, and the click only works about half the time. I have a classroom full of first graders who are waiting on my silly mouse to get it together so I can show them the next slide or open the video for them. It has been SUPER frustrating. I will be purchasing another brand.",2021,09
It was very helped,2021,09
Only have had this mouse for 2 months and already have to replace it. The charging port on the mouse no longer staying in place and therefore not charging. The port is wobbling around not making contact to charge. Going back to battery operated wireless mouse.,2021,09
"The mouse was very easy to setup.  Had instructions on charging, on the mouse itself, would definitely recommend, great on the price as well.",2021,09
"Finally, a sleep mode that is done right! ALL my other wireless mice when they go to sleep you have to click to wake, pretty standard. Well, when I wake those other mice with a right or left click it is a active click. Which means it acts as if it was never asleep and either opens a menu or activates what I clicked. Always frustrated me LOL!Well this one is super nice, you click and it's awake without doing an activation or selection. I have been looking for this in a wireless mouse and have finally found it!Also, it has a nice feel, not super ergonomic, but nice. The color selection is nice, I chose the grey. The RGB lights are very pleasant to the eyes. I haven't had it long enough to rate the length of the internal rechargeable battery but I will update soon. The cable that comes with the mouse is very short, but that isn't a problem. The DBI variety is nice as well. Very happy with this mouse!",2021,09
I have used this for 18 days (realistically less bc it’s only used M-F). It won’t hold a charge now and dies before lunch despite being plugged up over night.,2021,09
"This is the best mouse that I've used in a long time. No batteries needed, just charge it when needed. I've used this for a little over a day and it's doing great!",2021,09

I bought this mouse for home use.  I used it about two hours per day for two weeks.  Then no connection.. I thought it needed to be charged.  plugged it in and allowed to sit for two hours as instructed.  Now there is NOTHING.  Tried to charge longer but nothing is working!  DO NOT BUY THIS POS!!!!!,2021,09
"I bought this mouse less than a month ago and I loved it. But now, the roller is making a terrible squeaking sound.",2021,09
"Mouse is comfortable to use. Silent clicks. However, failed after only 2 months of use. I use every day for maybe a couple of hours at a time. Turned off when not in use and plugged in when necessary. Died about a week ago after having for only 2 months. Would not recharge. Will not use a  rechargeable mouse again. Would rather use rechargeable batteries.",2021,09
"I bought this mouse in June,  a month later the wheel stopped working.  I like the gold color and the smoothness of it, but the wheel is something that I would consistently need to use .",2021,09
 Great mouse. Fits my hand. Easy to use,2021,09
"only worked for three days, now won't charge",2021,09
"This mouse is awful. I bought 2, six weeks ago and one of them died in less than a week. The other just died. I got less than 2 months out of these and now I have to go looking again for a more reliable one.Avoid this - it looks nice but it doesn't last",2021,09
I needed a new mouse because the one I had been using was so old and was unreliable. This new one is so nice for such a great price! It fits my hand comfortably and has super quiet clicks which is super nice. It charges instead of using batteries which is a feature that I LOVE!! So excited to keep using this product!,2021,09
The charger was a real pain. My kids stopped using it the 2nd week,2021,09
I use this all day during work and then I use it to play the sims I the evening or on the weekend. It charges quickly and the battery lasts so long. I love that the mouse automatically goes into sleep mode because I often forget to turn it off. The matte finish is sleek and comfortable. I have no complaints,2021,09
I work from home and this is a great mouse overall! It’s super slim and it lights up but it’s not super bright that it’s bothering you.,2021,09
Just a quick note. Linux compatible out of the box. Nice mouse,2021,09
"Received this in end of July, already dead.  No longer charges, nothing!",2021,09
Doesn’t work and won’t charge. Cheap.,2021,09
I am really happy with the purchase of this mouse. I had been looking for a good mouse that cheap and wireless. This is the best fit. I am able to carry this everywhere and has long lasting battery. Also the range of the Bluetooth is really good because I was able to control my computer while I was another room,2021,09
"This mouse is quiet as advertised, so it's nice as someone sleeps in my office while I do schoolwork most of the time. The sleep mode on it is nice, but I feel it triggers too soon. That being said, it's bothersome, but not a deal breaker. I was concerned about the quality upon receiving it as it is quite light and feels cheaply made (I'm sure it is), but it's traveled in my laptop case quite successfully without incident, knock on wood. I'm sure if dropped or enough pressure was put on it, it could very well break or crack, but if you treat it well, I don't see why this mouse shouldn't last you. I've had it for about a month now and the only thing I can complain about is the sleep timer, so take that as you will.",2021,09
I got this mouse for work. It works great however it needs to be charged and unfortunately it can’t be used with battery it’s only usb charger so the only down side of this if u work with it for 4-5 days u will need to charge it or it will die on u and u have to keep charging it in ur laptop to keep using it! It’s unfortunately not for me and I don’t like how it doesn’t have battery or dies fast!,2021,09
"With the price, I was skeptical, but this mouse really does work well. As soon as I plugged in the USB, it took all of 15 second before I could start using it. The clicks are smooth and quiet, and it feels great ergonomically. The lights also look really good. I highly recommend it.",2021,09
Love this mouse. It’s so pretty to look at. And it DOES the job.,2021,07
"I waited a while to leave a review. I tought it would last, but it didn't. It was really smooth and long lasting battery. Little did i know while using it it would become apart internally. The scrollwheel broke. I usually fix my electronics easily, sometimes things just need a little adjustment but, this part broke and with no fixing. Maybe some of you are lucky and doesn't break easily. Mine did and not even 3 weeks of using it.",2021,09
"After a month and a half of buying this wireless mouse, the piece where you charge it, is broken. I have been extremely careful with it, and never dropped it. Loved it, but poor quality. Don’t buy it.",2021,09
Broken out of the box.,2021,09
Half the time there is about 1s delay after moving a mouse and moving the curser.,2021,09
I purchased this mouse to use with a chrome book. It pairs well and I have no complaints. I'm a night owl who prefers the darkness so the color changing led lights was a nice option that goes well with a night of cram studying. I would totally try more of their products.,2021,09
"Adorable little mouse...however...the darn thing will be on and won't do anything. I know to click to wake it (if it's in sleep mode) but half the time it won't be asleep and I have to click like 5 times for it to start actually working. Unfortunately, I'll have to find another mouse because this has become an irritating inconvenience.",2021,09
"The mouse look and feel is nice and sleek but it does not slide well due to the bottom strips coming off and restricting the movement. Unfortunately has to go back.The seller keeps contacting me, offering money to remove the review.",2021,09
"I think this is the best mouse i have used, really love it!",2021,09
"Just bought near end of July. Already having issues. Battery drains extremely fast, pointer has tracking issues, won’t click most of the time  have to repeatedly click on something for it to work.",2021,09
I would not recommend this item I bought this for my daughter for school it quit working after two weeks I was going to buy another one but I decided to wait to see how this one would work I’m so glad I didn’t buy another one when I put it on the charger it does not work I would not recommend this item at all if you buy it you’re wasting your money we liked it because the light so I tried to put it onto another charger and it did not work either so I don’t know what the problem is I would not recommend this do not buy it.  Here’s an update  I keep receiving emails from the seller wanted me to change my review I don’t think that’s how it should work because the item did not work they want me to change my review to good review or they want me to delete it and pay me money for it so now this is the second email I have received the first email they wanted to pay me $10 the second email they want to pay me $20 when you buy something online your post to do a review of your item so I do not recommend this item,2021,09
Wheel stopped working after return period.  No mistreatment.,2021,09
"The ergonomics are good, but it has a fatal flaw that makes it unusable.  When you first turn it on, it works fine.  But after 5 minutes or so, it becomes very ""twitchy"" or""jerky"" and completely unusable.I tried it on both Macs and PCs.  Same problem with both systems.It's too cheap to bother sending back, but I want to warn others not to make the same mistake.",2021,09
This is my favorite mouse because of the color and lighting. It is so cute and comfy to use! There is a charger to charge which I prefer over battery.,2021,09
Works well! He loves the lights.,2021,09
Really great little mouse. Good clicking and control. The battery lasts me a 3-4 days at work between charges. Get this mouse.,2021,09
Quit working after 1.5 month. Not worth the money paid.):,2021,09
we love it great product i actually wish i had a discount so i can order 2 more,2021,09
I didn't know it was possible to like a mouse so much! It is very comfortable and smooth. The battery life is pretty long. I don't like having to charge it because sometimes I forget to plug it in and then it goes dead. The battery life usually last around a week. As long as I can remember to charge it it is fantastic.,2021,09
I used this mouse once and it died after an hour .. was on the charger literally over night .. now i can’t even get it to charge at all .. waste of my money!,2021,09
Bought thus for my daughter with a new gaming computer. She loves it and the colors match her headphones,2021,09
"Wish you could have the option to not have the led color lights on all of the time, or a way to just pick one and not have the constant circulation. Looks bad during the day",2021,09
"I ordered this mouse.  I really liked it - It was slim, fit nicely in my hand and I loved how the lights changed colors.  After a few months, there was a problem with it.  When the company found out they gladly refunded me my purchase price with no questions asked.  Great customer service.  I would order it again after dealing with them if I hadn't already bought another mouse because I had work to finish.  I give them 5 stars",2021,09
Straight out of the package I had issues but figured I would hold on. The mouse does not move smoothly. Cannot click on things and then the mouse would move only intermittenly. Then it would stop and I would have to jerk it around.. and now it has just stopped. Just upgrade ... spend a little more on a logi mouse and it is worth it.,2021,09
"I got sick of using my touchpad and needed an actual mouse for 3D printing software. Trying to rotate and re-size print patterns with a touchpad was a nightmare, but this is a great mouse for the price and has already made my life a lot easier!",2021,09
"Really slick aerodynamic mouse, fits in your hand perfectly.  Love the different blinking colors. Also comes with rechargeable batteries all you have to do plug into available slot on your computer and you are ready to go.  Highly recommend !!!!",2021,09
"Definitely has a sleek feel to it and the lights are pretty, had it for a week so far so good 👍",2021,09
It was made of cheaper plastic then I expected and refused to charge after it ran out after the first time.  Wasn't enough money to make it worth my time trying to return it.  The color change was cool was it lasted.,2021,09
I love my mouse it's so cute and works great.,2021,09
"I didn't like the way the light shown thru the top, like the plastic was super thin and semi-transparent and it didn't come thru evenly. I have been using it for a while now and it sometimes gives me trouble. I have to tap the bottom to get the red light back on and the wheel stops working sometimes. Just unplug USB and plug back in fixes it. Still 5 stars because at this price it's great!",2021,09
" Works well until it goes into sleep mode.  When you wake it up the cursor is incredibly laggy and skips around.  The only way to get that to stop is to turn it off and then back on. Which seems minuscule, but it gets really annoy the longer you use it.Maybe I just got a defective one? It's got some really high marks... but buyer beware.Video shows it being woken up, then I turn it off/on and it works fine.",2021,09
"This is exactly what I was looking for. Streamlined, quiet and rechargeable!",2021,09
The mouse is great. The install was very easy. Just plug it in and it is ready to use. I love the changing lights on the mouse. If anyone wants a LED wireless mouse this is the mouse to purchase.,2021,09
I love how sleek it is and that its very responsive. Stylish and comfortable in my hand. If my wife takes this one (like she does most of my peripherals) then Ill definitely be buying another.,2021,09
Battery died after 15mins with or without the color changing lights on. This thing is useless,2021,09
I won't waste money on these with no batteries ever again. Junk,2021,09
"Literally, only had the mouse for three days and used it on the first day and now it has stopped working ! It doesn’t charge I plug it up and it may charge for 3 minutes then it just stops charging. Then when I go to turn it on it just turns on and instantly turns off. This mouse is literally a piece of crap. Will be getting my money back !!!",2021,09
"Very nice for the price. I usually use it for about 5 hours at a time and the battery holds. I have put about 80 hours on it and it's still working fine. It is simple, light, relatively comfortable, and it looks sharp.",2021,09
This product is very good and nice to hold and use. I will recommend this mouse to everybody.,2021,09
It's beautiful and sleek!,2021,09
"Was so excited to get this, it stopped working after one month. changed the battery but no go. I bought it to relieve my carpal tunnel pain and that was great but it just stopped working.",2021,09
only owned it for 2 weeks and  all i want to  di is throw it in the trash it freezes all the  time and it  goes dead every  2 hours,2021,09
Remember to recharge it--something I neglected to do because I am an idiot :),2021,09
I use it for gaming. I have no problem with it.,2021,09
"Cheaply made, mine broke already, barely used and it came apart and I can't snap it back together.  Short charge life though it is convenient to have a charge vs. battery.",2021,09
"I LOVE this mouse!! It fit & feels great in my hand- I’m on the computer a lot, so that is important to me. I LOVE the colors!! As you can tell by my mouse pad- I love colors. It’s easy and fast to wake.  It’s great- I don’t have a negative thing to say.",2021,09
"The mouse didn't track well and kept freezing, and then my laptop shut down within 10 seconds of plugging the adapter in. I would avoid this one.",2021,09
Needed a wireless mouse for a work laptop and this mouse gets the job done. The price is very affordable and the product came very fast. Was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the clicking sound- that should come in handy during the early mornings work days. Would recommend this mouse if anyone is trying to find something for their Macbook (USB C port).,2021,09
Long battery life. The lights are beautiful and you can change them. The mouse is sleek and gets the job done.,2021,09
"Perfect mouse for my laptop. Thin and easily stored, it tracks great and fits into my hands very comfortably. Sleep mode prevents battery drainage if I forget to turn it off after use. Highly recommend.",2021,09
The USB port broke inside my work laptop after only using this wireless mouse for 2 days. There was nothing that happened that would have/should have caused the usb to break other than it being poorly made. I’m am very disappointed with the outcome.,2021,09
" I liked the product while it lasted the few months it did, it just stopped working out the blue.",2021,09
I use it for work charged it and it last weeks . Easy to use and doesn’t jump around,2021,09
"I don't do much PC gaming at the moment so I can't speak for that. But this is a great buy. Very affordable, small but great for my big long hands, great response time, long lasting battery charge, and easy to see in the dark.",2021,09
Good quality mouse. Very easy to pair and it feels nice in your hand. I like the Led touch,2021,09
"This mouse was disappointing. It would work for a while and then it would lose connection and stop working. I thought at first it was losing traction and wasn’t sensing movement. So, I bought an entirely new mousepad. Did the same thing. After a few minutes of use, it would lose connection.",2021,08
"I wanted to find a slim, wireless mouse similar to a Mac's magic mouse, without the high price tag. While this certainly *isn't* a magic mouse, it's a pretty good substitute for a fraction of the cost. There are some tradeoffs of course, due to the slim nature of this mouse - it is extremely lightweight (i.e. not built like a tank) and sometimes the buttons require a sturdy click to ensure a response. But, all in all, I'm happy with my purchase. It looks nice, works well and it has gone about 2 months so far without needing a recharge. Speaking of which...I leave the mouse on all the time and it goes into sleep mode. No big deal, just realize you need to click a button to wake it up once you power on your laptop or desktop. Otherwise, it will seem like the mouse isn't working. Also, I've had a couple of instances where I had to reinsert the USB adapter to get it to reconnect. But, that was maybe 2 times in the past couple of months.In short, I recommend this product. The company provided great support when I received the wrong color mouse and they've been top-notch to deal with. They stand behind their product.",2021,09
This product already fell apart! It’s very lightly used and the mouse is broken already!,2021,09
"It was important for me to have a mouse that not only I could see in the dark, but something that was quiet. I also enjoy the fact that this mouse is rechargeable, so this mouse will last me for the long run. The light up feature is a huge plus - something I didn't know I would appreciate since I tend to work on my laptop in the dark. Great quality overall!",2021,09
I bought this mouse just over a month ago and it has already stopped working. Awful product and a waste of money!!,2021,09
Mouse doesn't connect to computer even when fully-charged and has USB plugged in. Am unable to even get a refund.,2021,09
"This is a realy bad mouse, iv used it for about 2 weeks now and the sensor only picks up half of my movements, the rgb is basally non existent and the feel of this mouse is realy crapy. It seems i can just break it with 1 hand. the batterie life is also terrible. If it could not get worse then this the company actually buys the reviews by sending you money via PayPal, so don't let the reviews make your decision",2021,09
"This is by far my favorite mouse! I can wake up my computer by tapping the button on the mouse. I goes to sleep saving me a bit in new batteries. If I didn't notice the mouse sliding off the laptop and onto the chair laser up, I would be changing the batteries frequently. This one recharges! No batteries to buy!",2021,09
I like that the mouse is slim. I also like the lights and how smooth it is. The sleep mode works fine. I use the mouse for work. I am happy with the rechargeable functionality and I find I don’t need to recharge daily. So far I have recharged every few days and I don’t know how long the change will last but at least 4 days for daily work use. It is a good value in my opinion.,2021,09
"Mouse never worked with usb c adapter. Flashes once red and never connects. Clearly cheap construction and plastic. Not even sure it charges properly, glows blue briefly and then turns back off.",2021,09
The mouse is comfortable. It's easy to click. It doesn't get stuck or it isn't too loose or too hard. The mouse itself is good size for my hands! The colors are very vibrant and pretty! They are soothing to see. Thank you for the complimentary mouse pad. It was thoughtful!,2021,09
"Rechargeable, beautiful features, long lasting hours for use. On/off switch.",2021,09
I use this product for Mac book air and it works great.,2021,09
"The mouse performs just like it states. Perfect design, smooth scrolling, and a quality product!",2021,09
"Super comfy and cool, but I get disconnected easily.",2021,09
"This little wireless mouse is awesome. The color at night looks amazing. Love the handle, my wife liked it as well that I had to buy her one as well. Thanks for the amazing product",2021,09
"slim profile, love that it doesn't need battries. colorful.",2021,09
"I really liked this mouse, being able to charge it and not worry about batteries, was working great up till today.  I tried to pull the wireless usb from the chromebook and it only partially came out.  The cover to it was still stuck inside the port.  I had to use tools to get it out and now it’s no longer usable.  Very upset, I have a lot of work I have to get done and using a mouse makes it smoother to navigate. Guess this would happen just after 2 weeks of the return window closing.  I have only had this since the end of July 2021.",2021,09
"This mouse is so hard to use that I’m scrolling my documents with the keyboard arrow keys. Push the left button 10 times, it might place the cursor, select the word or do nothing, depends on the mouse gods. If you leave the mouse arrow over the cursor when you FINALLY get it where you want and if you type, nothing happens.This thing is trash. Buying a Logitech mouse to replace.",2021,09
The mouse is fine but the scroll button started squeaking almost immediately and is pretty annoying.,2021,09
Mouse was just OK. The USB C adapter didn’t work at all. Junk parts.,2021,09
The mouse is fine for typical home use but the dongle drives me crazy. I remove it from my laptop when it's not in use and put it back under the mouse. Its pretty difficult to remove it again without some kind of sharp edge. I feel like it will eventually break.,2021,09
Battery holds for several days after one charge....probably almost two weeks or more.Lighting is beautiful and can be adjusted.Very responsive.,2021,09
"There is so much to say about this.  I bought this for my mom and she loves it.  It has a nice design, nice feel to it and works beautifully.  Well worth the money spent.  Thumbs up.",2021,09
Works well as described. Slim and easy to use. Even came with dongle for USB-C if your computer has it. lights can be turned on and off.,2021,08
Love the sleek style and easy to glide use of the mouse. Love the colors as well,2021,08
"I bought mine in Mint Green! It's almost effortlessly easy to set up. The battery is lasting beautifully.  I absoulutely love it soooo much, I just ordered my daughter one, in the dark gray. She's going to love the LED lights. THANK YOU!!!",2021,08
I was looked forward to having this mouse but I used about twice since I got and it's not working already. I don't know if it's defective or what. I guess there go my $13...,2021,08
Set up couldn't be easier.  I put the white USB thing into my computer and the mouse magically worked.  That's all it took!  I got the gold rose and it's very pretty.,2021,08
Absolute crap. The item doesn’t hold a charge and after a month it broke. Won’t even charge. Also way too small,2021,08
"But the item Jul 2021, 6 months i didnt chrage it more than 4 times yet the charger broke. Its nice but wont last",2021,08
Would love it if it held a charge or had a backup space for a battery. I have to constantly charge this usually every two days in the middle of my work day. Im over it going to go back to a battery mouse.,2021,08
"The mouse drags, after I use for like an hour, battery does not last too long, it takes longer to charge then the amount of time been use. Will not buy. Look for better quality name brand. I do not recomend at all. I wish I can get my money back",2021,08
Mouse goes dormant after 20-30 seconds and is Extremely glitchy until you turn it off and back on and then it works OK until you stop using it again. Zero out of five would never buy again,2021,08
"The USB-C receiver was missing upon opening, which was the main reason I got this mouse! I tried using it with another laptop and after fully charging it, it would not work!! After charging for hours and hours again, it still would not work! Very disappointed.",2021,08
"I like that it is lightweight and very durable. And it is quiet, I can use it at night or early morning and not make a sound.",2021,08
"I ordered it on June 14, 2021 and at the end of August the dongle broke off of my USB. There is still a metal piece stuck in the usb.",2021,08
Love this mouse. It's sleek and quiet. No loud clicking noise. Glides seamlessly. I will be back for another for my wife! Thank you.,2021,08
It broke after 4 weeks.,2021,08
Wish I hadn't missed the return window on this one. This mouse does not have a range of 10 meters as stated. It has difficulty tracking at just 1 meter (or even a couple of feet) away. This was supposed to replace a mouse from another seller that I also had trouble with. It turned out to be the same exact mouse. It's disheartening to find out that multiple companies are selling the same useless products. I would recommend spending a little more money on a mouse from a reputable brand.,2021,08
Just stopped working after 2 weeks,2021,08
"I loved this product for a couple of weeks, but after is ran out of juice the FIRST time and I charged it overnight, it hasn't worked again.  I CANNOT recommend this product.  And I love to give a 5 rating.  Wanted to just exchange it, but no option for that! Guess I had it too long.  But it is fun and beautiful!!!",2021,08
"Loved the look and feel of this mouse, but after only 4 weeks of school, the USB completely came apart when I pulled it out of my son's Chromebook. There was no impact or anything to cause this, and the kiddo was quite upset that it broke because he loves the look of this mouse as well as how it feels in his hand.",2021,08
It quit working after less than 2 months. Ugh!  It’s no wonder they only have a 30 day return policy.,2021,08
"I have been using the wireless mouse for 3 weeks.  I waited to write the review so I could truly review it based on my experience. It has not disappointed me, and I like everything about it.  I charge it whenever I remember to. The design is sleek, and the changing colors are soothing. When I take my eyes off the screen, I stare at the mouse. The respond to clicks is smooth, and quick. I can feel the clicks but not hear the clicks.",2021,08
Not bad. As expected for the price. Clicks a little loud when you click use it.,2021,08
Not attractive when lit up — because the light leaks through the white shell. Just not attractive,2021,08
"I purchased this mouse because it matched my laptop and seemed like it would look really attractive and cool when I was using it.It looked exactly like the mouse in the picture, and was easy to charge and use. It also held a charge for a long time which I was really happy about.The reason my review is so low is because my mouse only lasted for 2 months and then it completely stopped working no matter what I did. I certainly wasn't expecting a wireless mouse to last forever but it would have been nice to get at least 6 months out of it before it died.If you're looking for something cute and short-term and don't mind having to buy several mice every year this is the perfect purchase for you.",2021,08
This mouse made my life easier honestly!!!!!,2021,08
"Upon unpackaging the item, everything was as advertised and instructions were simple and easy to follow.  However, after a coupe of uses the battery was no longer holding a charge.  The light would turn on indicating that it was charging and a couple of minutes later, the light was off.  I told myself that maybe the mouse was charging even though the light was not on so I left it on to charge for a couple of hours.  Unfortunately, the mouse was not charging as it was already dead after five minutes of use.  I found myself using my laptop mouse more often then this mouse due to this.  Ergonomic design and lighting is great, but kind of useless given that the mouse did not fulfill its main purpose - 1 star.",2021,08
"Very disappointed in this product.  The item arrived obviously used and it did not work.  Overall, it was a very negative experience.  Would not recommend.",2021,08
"Light weight, ergonomic. Bought on 06/23/21. Died on 09/05/21. Impossible to recharge",2021,08
Bought for laptop - just poor performance of mouse.,2021,08
"The USB plug broke after one use. I plugged it into my chromebook's USB port and when I went to remove it, the metal stayed in the laptop. SUPER disappointed, I was so happy with it up until that point. Cheaply made, unfortunately. The mouse itself was cute, colors were nice, but when it's wireless the USB plug HAS to be good quality or it's useless.",2021,08
Never could get it to work.  Cannot adequately review it.,2021,08
"Wish the battery lasted longer. I seem to have to recharge it every month vs rechargeable batteries last me 6 months before I need to recharge. Otherwise, nice ergonomic shape and low enough to not affect the wrist. The optical sensor is not so great especially when battery is low.",2021,08
"Worked until it needed to be charged. After charging, it worked sporadically, and needed to be charged everyday. I need to be able to use my mouse everyday , not wait for it to be charged.",2021,08
Don’t bother even thinking about purchasing this item. It’s terrible. Does not connect to anything. Very cheap looking. The color doesn’t match the description. The seller is a little suspicious too. Tried giving me a refund with a fake Amazon gift card.,2021,08
"Likes: No noise click, lights look cool, chargeableDislikes:1. Chargeable battery life is very short. I had to turn off every time I don’t use it or else battery runs out super fast within 1-2 days!2. After 2 months the charging outlet is broken. There’s no way to fix it. Now I can’t use it anymore! Safer to go back to traditional battery mouse which lasts for a long time.",2021,08
"Awesome mouse, got it in 2 days and was very pleased with how this mouse performs!",2021,08
"After less than 2 months, not only will it not hold a charge, doesn't even work plugged into the laptop.Don't buy!!!!!",2021,08
"I got this because our child sleeps while i work. the mouse is super quiet!Pro:- quiet lef/right buttons- adjustable sensitivity- micro usb is easy to charge and doesn't interfere with mouse use- color changes- usb doesn't disconnectcons:- middle button ""click"" is louder- color can't be set. it rotates. it'd be cool if i could lock it in.for this price, it's a pretty good purchase.",2021,08
"It's a nice mouse, however they sent me the wrong color, I wanted black... not pink",2021,08
"There's something wrong with this mouse and I see I'm not alone. If I leave it alone for like 5 minutes, it stops working and can't be woken back up. I've tried powering it on and off, unplugging the usb, charging... the dang thing just decided not to work any more. Returning.",2021,08
Works as intended. The lights are pretty but a bit bright. I use it from across the room with no issues and the battery life has been excellent even with me forgetting to turn it off.,2021,08
"This is a really nice mouse, I like it and it works well. The only thing is you charge it with a mini USB charger and it takes a long time. Not sure if I'm not charging it all the way, but it has a short battery life.",2021,08
Doesn't stay charged,2021,08
I love this mouse cause it has really cool lights and I really like that it’s petite and lightweight.,2021,08
"Do not buy. Weak, flimsy crap",2021,08
"Use traveling with laptop compact and thin, better than standard mini mouse",2021,08
This product broke in 3 days,2021,08
Stopped working within a month. Won’t charge. Light comes on and goes right out. I bought 2. I plan on sending the other one back. Still in the box.,2021,08
"I used for 20-25 mins and it stopped working. The lights were ON, my PC detected the dongle, but mouse didn't work. Initiated the return",2021,08
" I really was waiting for use this mouse and everything OK.Great pink golden color, amazing that is rechargeable and super ergonomic for edit my videos.",2021,08
Awful,2021,08
I just bought this article about 3-4 weeks ago and at the beginning it was working just fine but it started acting up really bad since last week!!,2021,08
"UPDATE:Received a response from the seller and they are sending me a new mouse. Super quick response time, so updated my rating!Super cute and fun that it lights up, but doesn’t last. Only have had this 2 months and the scroll broke.",2021,08
"this mouse works for 5 mins or less at a time then has to be powered off and on, it starts lagging. I charged it all night so its not a battery issue. and it only works when its all lit up not in the 1 mode",2021,08
Worked fine for a month. Now it doesn't hold a charge and if I wanted it to work i'd need to tape the charger into a very specific spot. cheaply made piece of crap,2021,08
"Worked great for a few days, but then it quit working. It wouldn’t charge, and if I got the light to actually come on, the cursor wouldn’t move.",2021,08
The mouse worked great for just over a month - then the charging port detached from the mouse - yes- came right out. I no longer have the ability to charge it….This was PROBABLY a glitch with my individual unit ….Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.,2021,08
Center wheel was hard to roll after a couple of days. A few days later the whole thing failed.  I like the rechargeable feature but battery does not last long,2021,08
"This cable is SO SHORT, when you plug it into ANY of the computers USB ports the mouse is suspended in mid-air.  AVOID (by the way, it doesn't take batteries)",2021,08
"Very nice, sleek, little mouse. Its not the color I ordered. I really don't like rose gold, but the price is great, its otherwise everything I wanted, and is a good product. Does what its supposed to do. I just wish it was black, lol. (BTW, I checked. I did order black.)",2021,08
I purchased this mouse for my daugyer and I live that she loves it! I had wireless before but nothing compared to this one. Easy set up too! I would definitely recommend this mouse.,2021,08
"I liked it a lot at first, worked great. But after one week, it's not working properly. It sort of works, but is not smooth like it was at first - something I'd expect after at least a few months of having a cheap mouse. Sadly I got rid of the original box, so I cannot return it. I hope I can still get a refund!",2021,08
Mouse completely died and wouldn't charge in less than a month-no return policy,2021,08
Good material,2021,08
Worked well but dropped it off my desk on accident and it broke and no longer works.,2021,08
Pathetic,2021,08
"The battery of this mouse works well. I haven't timed it but I have left it on overnight and it stills has battery. I'm not a gamer but I imagine the gaming quality will be affected depending on how strong the bluetooth connection of the mouse is to the a PC setup. I recently switched from a laptop that had the standard rectangular port (USB-A) to one that needed the adapter (USB-C). The adapter that comes with the  mouse worked for about a minute before it stop functioning. So I brought out my own adapter (from a different device) and the mouse now works. I also tested both adapters with a wired mouse. It suffices to say that it was the mouse's adapter that is not working. I could have gotten a faulty one, so the problem could be exclusive to me.TL;DR - Mouse adapter didn't work. Ur screwed if urs doesn't work either and don't have an extra one.",2021,08
Charged it for hours and hours and could never pair with my Mac. I used the adaptor that was included and tried multiple times but I was never able to use it. Definitely not easy to pair as it’s advertised.,2021,08
"Maybe just unlucky given the reviews. But they mouse won't hold a charge. Simply doesn't work. Also the connectors are flush with each other, feels cheap.",2021,08
"I am not very hard on this mouse - I use it to work from home; but this morning after only using for 3 months the wheel of the mouse broke. Not sure what happened as I am very gentle on the mouse. It's a nice design and I love the lights and the fact that it's rechargeable, but it is pretty cheap and can break easily so keep that in mind when purchasing.",2021,08
"Light weight, fits hand perfectly",2021,08
Works well and charges very quickly,2021,08
"Ordered this mouse in mid-May. In June, it started acting a bit off and I could only use it turned on to one certain position. Yesterday (August 30th) the roller ball on top stopped working and now I can't scroll screens without using the sidebar. Very disappointed in how quickly this mouse stopped working. My grandmother always said you get what you pay for...and in this instance, she was 100% correct.",2021,08
" I was actually about to return the mouse Bc it stopped working and I couldn’t  find where to replace the batteries.  Had thrown out the box and prob the instruction booklet (can’t remember if it actually came with instruction booklet).  Went to Amazon and read the product detail and saw that it’s a rechargeable mouse, using a USB cable.Like: it’s small, lightweight, and comfortable.  It fit perfectly in my hand and when resting on top of the mouse, the mouse didn’t feel bulky or heavy.Like: the colors changing - pretty coolLike:  not battery operated.  You can charge using a standard USB cable.Like and Dislike:  I read that there is a silent option to mute click sound - have not found it to test - but like that there is the option to take the mouse silent.  After trying to research how to make the mouse silent, I have still not been able to do so.Like (maybe)  great that there is a sleep mode- not sure where to find it or if I have, really cannot tell the difference.  The options in the back are OFF, ON, and something that looks like a SUN.  When on the “ON”option, I think (I think it’s in sleep mode Bc the light turns red and then turn off) but when on the “SUN”mode, the lights change.Dislike:  When using the mouse, at first, there are no issues.  This is the same experience if the mouse is used with USB cable or wireless.  Randomly, the mouse will then lag and get stuck.  Needed to turn power on and off a few times.Aside from the minor issue of latency and turning the mouse on and off, it’s ok.  I got this mouse as a second mouse Bc the original mouse I purchased was taken by my son.  It is def for the more “casual” user - surfing the internet or checking on EMs.  If trying to use for work, I’d get a mouse a little bit more sturdy and reliable.",2021,08
Comfortable and responsive mouse. Clicking is indeed very quiet. Lights are just as advertised and battery is more than satisfactory. Can use multiple days without charging.,2021,08
"Got this mouse for my desktop setup which I mainly use for office purposes and it has been working great. It replaced a cheaper version than this one that I got at 5 Below of which I did not expect much but got me going for 2 years.I don't think I would recommend for gaming since is a little on the small side and somewhat flat, but who knows, is it very responsive thought and looks nice with the changing colors.",2021,08
"I have touchscreen chromebook but i still need a mouse to use on excel worksheet. This is slim, easy to use and handy. Led lights is a plus.",2021,08
This baby is great! Works perfect with my 2020 MacBook Pro and I love that it’s rechargeable!,2021,08
"Mouse doesn't slide easily, sticks and on both my desk surface and my mouse pad. You have to click very hard to make a selection and the scroll bar is not consistent in speed. Wouldn't purchase this product.",2021,08
I really like the feel and look of this mouse. I don't like that anytime I stop using the mouse for a minute or two that the mouse doesn't react. I end up turning it off and on again to get it working. I'm interrupted frequently while using the mouse so it's not realistic for me to turn the mouse off every time I stop using it.Edit: Today is day 5 of using the mouse while I wait to receive the other mouse I bought. The mouse no longer consistently turns on when I turn it off and on again to stop it from lagging.,2021,08
"I really liked this mouse.  The design is sleek, I can use the little attachment for my Mac to make it compatible and it maneuvered well.  However, after only a few weeks of use the top plastic portion that splits down the middle to accommodate left and right clicking just literally spit apart and now my mouse is not functional.  I'm very disappointed in the quality and durability of this item.  However, I gave it 3 stars for the awesome performance prior to it breaking.",2021,08
"stopped working after the second week.  i charged it overnight every night before i left the office and it was working fine then  it started skipping so i tried to put it on the charger for the day and used another mouse thinking maybe it just didn't charge the night before then when i took it off it wouldn't work at all.  BUT, it does feel great in your hands and the lighting is pretty cool...just wish it would have lasted!",2021,08
NO USB ONLY TYPE C,2021,08
It stopped working after 2 months,2021,08
Great mouse! I got this because my laptop had to many wires sticking out everywhere. This has been great to free up the mess of wires and make my work day easier.,2021,08
"I was a little worried about battery life based on some of the other reviews.  I am not a gamer. I have an office job.  But I'm on my computer probably 12-14 hours a day and used my mouse extensively.  A single charge lasts me 4-5 days.  You can also use the mouse when you are charging.  I have a USB port on my keyboard that I use per my attached picture.  As you can see, the charging cable is pretty short.  So some might need to extend the cord.But overall, I am very happy with this mouse.",2021,08
Just had mouse for 3 months and it has stopped working.,2021,08
"Works well, hooked up immediately, love the feels and the look!",2021,08
Batteries would be SO MUCH easier with the way the power runs out after charging by USB. Frustrating because if your in the middle of something I have to go back to old mouse until this mouse is ready to use. I love the feel of it though and the cool lights.,2021,08
"This was a great mouse for it's price. Loved the colorful lights too! Overall, satisfied with this purchase.",2021,08
Product broke after one month of using.,2021,08
We have been extremely pleased with this mouse. We Have an HP Laptop & it works wonderfully with it.,2021,08
I bought this and after a few months the center stopped working so i cant scroll at all. Also it doesn't click. Terrible product.,2021,08
This is not working,2021,08
"The mouse is sturdy and the rainbow lighting feature is fun. It auto shuts off after 10 minutes (I think) which is great for saving the battery. I thought that having to put it on a charger would be a major inconvenience it's not, at all. The recharge is quick and I only do it once a week, so far.",2021,08
This little mouse works great for my needs. It charges straight away from my laptop and functions as expected. I would buy it again and I recommend it to anyone needing an inexpensive wireless mouse.,2021,08
Very cool lighting as seen in the photos and it's a soft touch mouse... no loud clicks here!,2021,08
I ordered this mouse in April 2021 and it no longer holds a charge.,2021,08
"not sure why, but it kept dying real quick.",2021,08
great mouse I love it,2021,08
I have to charge it every ten minutes of use.  I charge it for hours and still only last ten minutes.  It's really cute but not very functional.,2021,08
great little mouse.  Fits nicely in my hand. You can turn the LED on or off.  Click to wake from sleep.  Quiet clicking.  I like it :),2021,08
👍🎁💕,2021,08
"Purchased this because of it can be recharged with any usb port, no batteries required. It is also compact with a low profile. It will be great for travel because it will take up very little space. Fits easily in a pocket without bulging out.",2021,08
This was a disappointing and irritating order. I am a college student and a full time manager so I work a lot on my laptop. I ordered a mouse for ease of certain tasks that required a right click or highlights. This mouse was unusable directly out of the box. Charged it up and it never held a charge long enough to work. Very disappointing and a waste of time.,2021,08
"The mouse works fine, but i was disappointed that the color did not match my MacBook as it shows.",2021,08
"I probably should have known... but the light is either red or it cycles through colors. This is probably cool for gamers or middle school kids. I would rather be able to pick a color, but that is not a feature available. Which - is probably something I should have expected - but I was being hopeful.",2021,08
Really like the feel of the mouse in my hand. Have dropped it numerous times and it keeps working like a charm. So far I am really pleased with it,2021,08
"Nice mouse, but would not charge after single use. Tried with the usb on the computer, other usb chargers, even switched their cord out…",2021,08
"This mouse has become my new best friend! I have arthritis which has severely affected my hands. Its extremely ergonomic in shape and usage. The mouse is absolutely quiet as promised, plus is easily used without a huge amount of pressure from my fingers, hand, or wrist . The mouse also moves very easily on my mouse pad with no glitches or hesitations. My hands are grateful, and so am I!Another feature is the light additions which means it can be found anywhere in the dark. Also the aqua was an excellent choice in color for me as it does show against many darker colorsOnce charged the battery is good for a quite a few days. I do use the mouse from four to eight hours daily (and sometimes more). I have only had to charge the mouse once in the past week after using continuously for EIGHT days. Actually it was still working but had become a bit slow to react . Rather than wait for it to quit completely I charged it during the night so it was ready in the morning for the next week.I am very glad I chose to try this mouse. My next purchase of a mouse (if or when needed) will be a repeat of this one in a different color.This is an unpaid and unsolicited review from a grateful owner.",2021,08
"it’s a good size weight and shape but it bothers me that you can’t turn the red light off when you move it. if you have the rainbow light on, the red light still goes on when you move it so you don’t really get the rainbow effect",2021,08
"Let's face it, it just a mouse, but kinda fun to have the colors, since my keyboard is colored too!",2021,08
Loved everything about this mouse until the charging jack came loose after three months of use. There is no way to charge it now.  I guess you get what you pay for.,2021,08
This mouse is very comfortable and the colors are super cool. It’s also very economical and works well. Highly recommend!,2021,08
I love this mouse! The colors are beautiful and I've gotten many compliments on it. It feels great to use as well. I took away one star because the charging cord stopping working about a day after using it. Easily charges with any micro USB though. It's been a couple months and still works being used every day at work.,2021,08
"I love this mouse. Its quiet, modern and the lights are a nice added touch. Pro tip: remember to store the usb connector under the mouse when not in use, I have lost mine or damaged it in the past.",2021,08
"Good if you want a wireless mouse that works for 3 months.  Otherwise, buy something else.",2021,08
"This wireless mouse is very light and thin. It can be used for a long time after charging. I didn't read the instruction at all, I just plugged the receiver which is hided at the bottom of itself into the USB port of the markbook air and it began to work normally. It’s quite easy and quick to get start.",2021,08
I love this wireless mouse! It has nice LED lights on it and it lasts for up to 5-7 days without a charge!I definitely recommend this product!,2021,08
Excellent.  My 8 year old  God daughter used it for school She said it was fantastic!,2021,08
Its a great mouse but it stops tracking if I stop using it.. like the ponter starts lagging.,2021,08
"The one I ordered will only turn on if the switch is in a strange position that is between the clicks. I had to move the switch carefully with two fingers until I found the very small area where it turns on. Sending it back because its almost impossible to use, if the switch gets moved it takes a few minutes to turn it back on.",2021,08
"I used this guy for dayssssss upon receiving without charging. A few times I’ve had (thought I had) issues with the mouse but I had it backwards. That’s my main complaint- too easy to put backwards. It doesn’t attract dust and dirt, works on every surface I’ve put it on…..and it’s cute",2021,08
"Got this for a great price, the size is perfect for my hands and is easy setup.",2021,08
The mouse arrived with great packaging and easy to do follow instructions. The feel is very smooth. I like the on off switch which is very sturdy and I think will last for a long time. Charging is simple. Able to store USB adapter on mouse. Best of all the lights are bright and as expected,2021,08
"Loved the mouse and was using it regularly for 4 months. Just recently, the scrolling wheel completely stopped working. All of the other functions work, but the scrolling feature is a must for me.",2021,08
This mouse is on point. Literally. I had never thought of buying one to this slant and Size until the color locked me in. It's an absolute match to my laptop. The setup was quick and easy. I simply turned it on input the USB and was using within seconds. It's very versatile and works with or without a pad. Lightweight and easy to store with the flat shape.,2021,08
This is a second time I've bought this mouse and its broken on me within a few months. It just decides to work only when it wants to.,2021,08
"It worked for a month and a half, now it's glitchy and won't work. Pass this up and buy a quality mouse. Looks pretty with the colors.... Other than that... It was a waste of money.",2021,08
Doesn’t hold charge for even a full day.,2021,08
"I use it in my class. As I move around classroom, I click the mouse to move on with my presentation. Good so far.",2021,08
Only used it 4 times and went to turn it on and won’t power up. Lasted 32 days. 2 days past the return time they gave of 30 days. What a waste of money. Thanks god it wasn’t much. Don’t waste a dollar on it.,2021,08
"I love this mouse! I use it on multiple devices and it uploads fast. I like it how sleep mode would kick in if you haven't used it in a while. However, it is easy to wake up as well. I like it how you can switch between solid red to rainbow colors. Its quite and moves smoothly. Did I mention I love it?",2021,08
Light never turned on. Came dirty,2021,08
"Bought this LED wireless mouse July 5, 2021 and received it a couple of day later and really loved it!  Well now it's Aug. 24 and as of yesterday it suddenly stopped working correctly.  I don't even use it with the fancy light changes on.  I tried charging it a couple of times and even once over night and it is still not functioning as it should.I noticed that if left still for a few minutes it would sometimes function well, but only for a few seconds and then it would begin to sporadically move the cursor, if at all.  The little laser guide light goes dim and blinks quite fast.  I am thinking that it suddenly cannot hold a charge....?  Oh, I have also tried using it while connected to the charge port, but it does the same.I would have given it a 5 star rating if it continued working properly as I really like it.  However, since the sudden misfunction, I cannot give it more than 2 stars and I must say that I would NOT recommend this mouse anymore.",2021,08
"I love this mouse! it is very lightweight with an attractive look. One of my favorite features is that it is rechargeable. Second, you have the option of selecting one color (default to red) or multiple colors (swap automatically).  The switch is on the bottom portion of the mouse. My favorite feature is the fact that the mouse goes into sleep mode when you turn off your computer. Saved me so many times from having a dead mouse. It can also be charged while in use. Overall I would definitely recommend this mouse to friends and family.",2021,08
"Shipping was fast and I loved the LEDs. But today - after a week - it stopped working. I figured it needed a charge. It;s now been connected to my laptop for over three hours and the blue light has gone off, which is supposed to mean is all charged and ready to go. But when I disconnect it - nothing, Dead. Guess the low price was a giveaway I should have paid more attention to.",2021,08
won't buy againdoesn't lite up as promised,2021,08
Great product for the value,2021,08
"Within 3 minutes of plugging the new ""rechargeable"" mouse into a USB hub charger (thankfully it wasn't plugged into my daughter's brand new laptop she just opened for her birthday) my house started to smell like smoke and I found the charging cable melting to the mouse in the drawer I'd just put them in to pre-charge. If this had happened at night my house would have probably caught fire. DO NOT BUY. FIRE HAZARD 🔥 DANGEROUS",2021,08
"The wired mouse I've been using at work was driving me insane with its loud clicking noises. I love the convenience of this one being wireless, so it's easy to use with my desktop or laptop. It's super easy to install, and while the buttons aren't completely silent, they are significantly more quiet than your average mouse. The colorful LEDs are fun, but it's not a feature I'll be using a lot. So far I've had no issues with connectivity or responsiveness at all. I certainly recommend this mouse at this price point.",2021,08
The mouse would be fine except it stopped tracking within 1 month.  Cheaper isn't better,2021,08
You can hardly maneuver the clicker with this mouse. It doesn’t do its main function. The LED is ok … I guess. But what’s the point of a mouse that doesn’t do it’s job!? I guess I have a new flashlight. I’d give 0 stars if I could. Don’t waste your time or money on this!,2021,08
Don't buy this product.  This lasted me about a month and 1 week..just enough time to pass where the window of returning was no longer available. Mouse quit on me while I was taking a final for a test. Perfect timing.,2021,08
I bought this mouse thinking a rechargeable was the way to do. It worked well for about a day.  I tried to recharge it several times but would not hold any charge at all. I've gone back to a battery operated mouse.,2021,08
Feels great nice color looks like it will last a very long time. Charge last along time as well.,2021,08
"The left mouse button is impossible to use. I cannot click and drag. It does not respond to a double click. What a nightmare. I would not recommend this at all. I was very excited for a wireless, no battery mouse. I will be returning this.",2021,08
This product was definitely worth the money. It's equipped with every function desirable for a wireless mouse. Being rechargeable is alot better compared to constantly switching batteries personally. The RGB lights were nice as well.,2021,08
It was working great at first but now it's not working. I've had this mouse for about 1 month.,2021,08
The USB break apart and could no longer use the cordless mouse. Ugh,2021,08
So far so good and looks cool with the led lights!,2021,08
Color is not shiny black. Cheap plastic material,2021,08
Works great,2021,08
This mouse is great!  I love that it is so compact.  Being rechargeable is a plus for me!!  The lights make it fun to use!!,2021,08
"First time charging this mouse I started smelling a burnt plastic smell in my home. Walked over to where it was charging and noticed the smell was a lot stronger, I reached down to unplug it and the cord was red hot!!! Had I not been in that room it would have started a fire. Not happy!!!",2021,08
This wireless mouse works great and is easy to set up. The led lights gives it a nice look and the click is silent. The battery last a day I haven’t had to change them. Over all a 10/10 mouse,2021,08
"I have tried charging this mouse with the original cables it came with, did not charge. I then tried multiple cables and power sources I already owned, still did not charge. I left it plugged in for 12 hours while I was away from home, I come home to an uncharged mouse. The blue light stays on for about 30 seconds before shutting off. The design and price were what attracted me to choosing this specific mouse, I would recommend spending a bit more on a quality mouse that can serve its purpose.",2021,08
"Worked for 1 day, then.... nothing won't even turn on.",2021,08
Awesome mouse for the price,2021,08
"The mouse works, but after less than 1 week of use by my son, the roller ball no longer works. You can't scroll with it. The rest of it works, for now, but will probably not make it through the school year.",2021,08
"This is a low rise mouse. Very responsive and smooth movement. I would definitely buy one again.Note: I don't play games, so I can't speak to that aspect.",2021,08
It broke the same day,2021,08
I have been using this mouse for a couple of weeks now.  I love the rechargeable feature and the battery seems to last a long time (never turn it off).  Highly recommend this one!!!,2021,08
Item broke already. The wheel in the middle does not work. Did not last 2 months,2021,08
"great range. finally we found a wireless mouse that works well. we use this for television viewing. we have our laptop attached to our television. we are a good 4-6 feet away from our television and laptop when we use this mouse. again, it has great range. easy to use and works quickly. highly recommended.",2021,08
"I just got the item and to be honest I didn’t expect much from it in the first place but reading reviews I thought it was relatively good. The clicking tends to stick w mine and I tried doing a CPS (Clicks per second test) and out of the 20 time I clicked, the test only registered 9. I can say it wasn’t the tests fault since I have to triple click most things in order to pretty much do anything. For everyday work I won’t say I recommend it but it’s enough for that but for gaming I do not recommend this since 90% of your clicks won’t work because the mouse itself isn’t that great quality.",2021,08
It worked great while it worked but after less then three months my mouse has stopped working. It turns on and lights up but will no connect to the usb wirelessly any more. I won’t buy again and wouldn’t recommend if you’re looking for something to last.,2021,08
"If you're looking for a wireless mouse, keep looking! This is not it! The first one I received didn't charge. So, they sent me another one which I started using at the beginning of July, and now it doesn't work anymore. Didn't even last 2 months with normal usage, no gaming or anything. Such a shame, because I actually liked it.",2021,08
"I purchased this mouse for my laptop due to the ease of having a mouse verse a mouse pad. This mouse is very easy to use, rechargeable, and the lights makes it easy to find.",2021,08
"When item was plugged in, it almost immediately melted the charging cable. Thankful that I was close by and smelled the burning smell to unplug it before worse happened.",2021,08
Stopped working after 4 months,2021,08
It only worked one day. Never would connect after that.,2021,08
 It is a nice mouse but it is not changing colors it only shows red,2021,08
"This is such a great mouse! It works so well and I love the pretty colors. It also doesn’t make any noise while clicking, which was my #1 priority. I would definitely recommend this.",2021,08
Purchased on june 28.  I never charge over night.  I  only charge mouse when needed  and turn off after each use however month and a half later mouse is no longer charging.  Very short life span.,2021,08
Pretty lights but when it sleeps you have to turn it off and wait ten seconds and turn it back on.  Stopped working completely less than a month after buying so now its a light up paper weight,2021,08
Does it’s job. Looks pretty and is rechargeable,2021,08
This mouse saves a ton in cost of batteries because it is rechargeable. It fits the palm of my hand very comfortably. Well worth the cost.,2021,08
Easy to use and easy to connect. Workes great with my laptop.,2021,08
The mouse never turned on :(  Complete waste of money - NOT HAPPY,2021,08
"Looked cool, but it broke within the first couple hours of use. Too late to return it, so I guess I have to just eat my investment.",2021,08
Do not buy this complete junk too small,2021,08
"Loved this mouse at first. I had zero problems with it. However, now it will not stay on. It has charged over night but as soon as I take it off the charger to use it, it dies. It will not turn on and I am not able to use it. I guess you get what you pay for.",2021,08
"It was quiet, slim, and responsive…for a month.  Then, the casing began pulling apart and the rolling cursor stopped responding.  Too bad it was such a short-lived product!",2021,08
It’s ok. But getting the dongle out was quite the challenge. Not the greatest design on that part.,2021,08
Needs to be charged all the time.  Not very comfortable to use.,2021,08
"Full charge lasts two hours or less. If you want to use it all day, you have to charge it three to five times and of course can't use it while it's charging. I'm buying a different wireless mouse today.",2021,08
"As advertised. Love that you can’t really hear the clicks. Charge it once a week and use it approx. 40 to 45 hrs a week, on color changing setting. Easy set up. Would buy again. Only thing I don’t like is the short charging cable which is a personal preference. You would need a usb plug right next to the mouse if you still need to use it while it’s charging.",2021,08
"This was for my son for school work and he loved the features and the fact that it has lights to make it fancy. It seems pretty smooth without making clicking noise and compact, pretty good alternative for expensive mouses from branded ones",2021,08
"Got this product June 28, 2021. It is August 18th and it no longer functions even when fully charged.  Lasts less than 60 days. It’s beautiful but will end up being a waste of money.",2021,08
Stopped working after a week…,2021,08
I love how this mouse looked and it didn't hurt my hands. Unfortunately I  was able to only charge it 2x and now it won't recharge at all.,2021,08
"Nice little mouse, have gotten compliments on it, functions as expected.",2021,08
"I thought this mouse was very cute. I love the led feature, and I used it to play games with friends (Val, league, genshin, etc) and it is passable for someone who plays casually like me but probably not for someone picky about equipment.However, today it spent some time in the side pocket of my backpack and no longer seems to work :( I turn it on and the light flashes and goes off again, and there is no way to take it apart or try to fix it. If you transport your laptop/pc a lot I would hesitate to get this mouse, but otherwise I was a fan.",2021,08
Solid battery life and great aesthetic. Worth every penny.,2021,08
"I was initially in love with this mouse however soon after while scrolling, the mouse stopped scrolling. You don’t realize how something so small you really see crucial everything works. For the scroll to just stop, I literally want to throw the whole mouse out and probably will. I decided to hold on to it cause it’s just so cute and matches my laptop, however soon after the sensor and clicker stopped working as well.Now I’m forced to get a new mouse.",2021,08
i like the silent clicking and the smoothness and the ergonomic design but the wheel doesn’t scroll anything on the computer. the wheel will move but won’t scroll anything on the screen.,2021,08
"I use this mouse for basic tasks, no gaming, but I like the fact that is rechargeable and seems to hold the charge long enough. I also like the silent mode so I can work at night on bed without disturbing my wife.",2021,08
This mouse works well and is small and quiet.,2021,08
So far so great! No loud clicks and feels good in hand.,2021,08
easy to use,2021,08
SLICK  beautiful mouse for all apps. love that led display on the mouse,2021,08
"The item is easy to work with , but I honestly got it because I liked the LED light feature. However, the mouse does not light up.",2021,08
"I purchased this wireless mouse because I needed one and a cheap one, I was very impressed, you don’t even need to use mousepad, it works smoothly by itself!!",2021,08
"This came on time, exactly as described. It is quieter when you click the buttons than a regular mouse. It's easy to charge and works well. It's wireless which is great! It works perfectly with my sons laptop, and the games he plays on it. I have no complaints. Would recommend to anyone!",2021,08
I purchased this for my mom and once the battery went dead it would not recharge.,2021,08
Works well.,2021,08
This mouse is smooth to use and feels great in my hand. I recommend it.,2021,08
"The mouse is nicely shaped and feels nice in your hand. The clicking is quiet. The only problem is that it does not stay charged more than one day so I have to keep it plugged in, which defeats the purpose of having a wireless mouse.",2021,08
Mouse is very lagging even after full charge.,2021,08
"NOBODY ORDER THIS PIECE OF CRAP, ITS TRASH I CANT EVEN FORTNITE CAUSE ITS TOO FREAKING TWITCHY",2021,08
"I was really looking forward to having a wireless mouse that's rechargeable, but since it has to be recharged every day I just use it with the wire attached. Very disappointing.",2021,08
"Worked when I first charged it, once the charge ran down it wouldn’t charge again.",2021,08
"It seemed to work ok for a couple of days and then I started noticing that it wasn't moving my cursor where I wanted it to go.  Sometimes I'd have to move it real fast just to find the cursor.  No matter what I did, it took an extraordinary amount of time to get it to land in the right spot.  I gave up and started using my old mouse again.",2021,08
Exactly what I wanted and expected.  Love the colors!,2021,08
This is a great wireless mouse at a great price. It comes with a USB charger and quickly connected to my laptop. It feels great on my palm and the cursor moves around the screen smoothly. I love the ability to change the mouse lighting and love how lightweight but durable it is.,2021,08
"This mouse is cute and comfortable to use but the only downfall is if it is sitting idle for a few minutes, it’s hard to get it working again.  Sometimes I have to turn it off then on",2021,08
"I have had this mouse for a month and other than I like the colors, it is worthless.  I have tried every kind of surface and mouse pad and the performance is very erratic.  I tried recharging and it is no better and today, it just died in the middle of a Zoom meeting I was hosting.  I am flushing it and making a note to never purchase this brand again.",2021,08
Bought 3 of these....the lights are fun and fit really well in smaller hands. BUT these 3 Christmas gifts are no longer usable...durability stinks. My opinion? Would not buy.,2021,08
When I got this mouse I noticed a rattling sound. When it was plugged up i saw that there was a piece broken and rattling around on the inside. The lights don’t look good at all. I returned it.,2021,08
"It’s been a few months and still works well! Very nice purchase, Thank you !",2021,07
I have charged this mouse ONCE since I received it! I use it EVERY day! It’s been over a month now and no signs of low battery yet. Crazy!,2021,08
IT IS GREAT,2021,08
Junk! Would not charge after 21 days of use. Sticking to battery operated!,2021,08
Upon receiving the mouse I charged it with the charging cable. Used it for a considerable amount of time and plugged it in. Upon plugging it in there was a an odd smell. The smell was the cable starting to melt!!! I unplugged it and will not be using it again. I’m lucky that I didn’t walk away or my place could have caught on fire!! What a disappointment.,2021,08
Works great and my students love the color changing lights. I bought it for my second computer and it has been so helpful. I would suggest purchasing for yourself ! It has a very smooth texture and slim design always you to take it anywhere. It charged quickly so that I could use it immediately.,2021,08
Using this for my work laptop. Receieved afternoon Friday and used for a little bit and pleased. Put up laptop for the weekend. Went to use it today (Monday) and non responsive. Tried everything and still not working. This thing is junk...,2021,08
This item has already stopped working. It was purchased in May,2021,08
It's pink and super light love it a ton,2021,08
The item was sent without all the items in the box,2021,08
Only holds a charge for 15 minutes :(,2021,08
The technology is great..but ergonomic it is not,2021,08
I use it with my chromebook,2021,08
"Don't get me wrong, I do like this mouse. It's smooth, pretty, easy to use, and overall pretty great. BUT and this is a strong but, if you so much as bump the usb plug in ever so lightly, all use the the mouse ceases and you have to re set it up. I usually use my computer on the couch with my kids next to me and sometimes they bump it, or my dog, or even me. It could be super light, and it still will make me unplug it and re do it over. It's really annoying.",2021,08
Amazing tool for my job that required lot of documentation .,2021,08
Mouse is too small for my hands,2021,08
Made very cheap.  Broke the second it was too late to return it.  I guess I got what I paid for.  Save your money and buy a better quality mouse.,2021,08
"Not a great item for long term use, could be more sturdy.",2021,08
Only last 7 months before it quit working,2021,08
"The style was perfect. However, the mouse stopped working within the first week. I tried to charge it but it simply stopped working. It was a waste of money.",2021,08
Both worked for a month. Both are having issues now. One won’t charge. The other is having connection issues,2021,08
I used the mouse after I got it for 2 hours and within the first 30 minutes the light srop changing colors. It is now only red.,2021,08
"I was searching for a wireless mouse on Amazon and for the price, this was a no-brainer. I received this mouse in the mail in small compact packaging, very simple and easy to get it going. The charging cable that it comes with charged the mouse in about 2 hours, once I plugged it in the mouse lit up blue and turned off once it was fully charged. I purchased the Gray to match my laptop, looks good and not as shiny as I thought it would be which is great. Very comfortable with it in my hand and I have pretty big hands, really receptive to the movement when scrolling. The lights feature is cool if you want to have something different. The silent mouse clicking is a great feature as well if you ever have to do work in a quiet space you will not hear the loud clicking noise coming from this mouse. Very satisfied with this purchase so far.",2021,08
Love this mouse. Great for everyday use. Moves around smoothly and is very quite!,2021,08
"The mouse quality is poor, type C adapter doesn’t work, can’t work for Macbook, but USB adapter works.",2021,08
"Needs better battery life, but overall good wireless mouse. Great Customer service; but they will contact U if u leave a bad review....",2021,08
"Worked fine the first 20 minutes on my computer- no lag. Then, it started being unresponsive, lagging and just a pain to work with. Don’t waste your time on this product.",2021,08
"This mouse is terrible. I bought it for work, its not like I needed anything super advanced, just something that would give me a little more space than the touchpad. This mouse skips when you move it, and if you want to click something you have to hit the button 3 or 4 times. It's also very uncomfortable in the hand.",2021,08
"I bought this cause its wireless and has come cool led lights. Works great, no complaints. Yes I would recommend!",2021,08
"Works about 10% of the time, making it more frustrating than if it was literally useless. 10/10 paperweight, doesn’t work as a mouse though.",2021,08
Great value mouse. Does it job and can't complain with this price,2021,08
"Ordered this for my 9th grader, she has a laptop provided by her school and she received a laptop from her grandparents as a gift. Easy to switch between laptops with this mouse, so she can watch YouTube and play games on her personal laptop, and scroll and jump between apps easily on the school laptop. Of course its not as solid as the Apple version, so thats why not 5 stars",2021,08
Works as advertised! Great price!,2021,08
"I used this mouse once, after this use it died so I was going to charge it up figuring I didn't give it enough time to charge... I tried 3 different times and it wouldn't charge at all so I decided to just go back to my old mouse. I tried to remove the usb and the metal part broke off and stayed inside my laptop so I had to remove it and there was no fixing it. I'm so disappointed in the quality of this mouse.",2021,08
"this product is crap, do not buy, opened fresh out of the box and immediately had trouble. lightweight and cheap feeling, does not slide particularly well, although sleek, it isn't the most ergonomic thing. but worst of all, after plugging in and turning on, the mouse will work normally for around 30 secs, if you leave it idle for longer than that, the response becomes choppy and the mouse essentially stops working. tried on multiple devices to no avail. DO NOT BUY, in most cases id say you get what you pay for, but here it feels like even less than that.",2021,08
Broke within a week of having it.,2021,08
"Really like the way this wireless mouse feels & acts.  My last one died, and now I'm almost glad it did so I could buy this. Love the LED light color changing when it's in use, and the auto shutdown when it's not. It's performed well and moves easily.  Great value too.",2021,08
"I returned this mouse because I am a sucker for design even though it only worked for one day and ordered a replacement. The replacement mouse has lasted 5 weeks with intermittent issues. However, it no longer charges. Don’t waste your time and money",2021,08
 Moving fast and light easy to hold for moving,2021,08
"It's not very responsive but it does work. The lights are terrible but it does light up. As far as adjusting the DPI, I did not see a difference at all. I would not recommend for gaming but if you wanna surf the web on a smart TV its works well.",2021,08
The clicker doesn't work very good.,2021,08
"The mouse feels great in your hand, is delightfully colorful but doesn't scroll down the page. I was only able to click down which is bothersome on web pages.I would return it but I threw out the box.If you don't get a defective one, its a good buy for the price.",2021,08
Stopped working within 1 week,2021,08
Not work good 😕,2021,08
Great product!! Mouse is exactly as advertised on the site. Highly recommended!!!,2021,08
Worked great in the beginning now it keeps disconnecting or won't connect at all. Super fustrating. It's not even that old.,2021,08
Very smooth and quiet!,2021,07
The laser stop working after having the mouse for about 2 months. Disappointing.,2021,07
"Was nice until it stopped working after only a few weeks.  I wouldn't buy this again, not worth the money.",2021,07
Easy to set up and use. Like the slim design.,2021,07
Great mouse! Very fast and smooth. I was skeptical at the price being so cheap but wow! Fantastic item! I would definitely buy again... in fact I am getting a second one for my son for school.,2021,07
Great thin ergonomic mouse. Like the surrounding blue light,2021,07
Battery dies quickly especially if you have the changing light mode on.  Less than 1-2 days of battery life with 8-hr use.,2021,07
"The charging cord is so short and flimsy, it won’t stay connected to both pieces, so it is difficult to get a full charge. The mouse does not hold charge. After be left on the charger overnight, it is dead within five minutes use.",2021,07
"This mouse is great! It's sleek, responsive, and has awesome LED colors that rotate.Best bang for my buck...",2021,07
"I recently bought this mouse because I have used it before, but my previous mouse broke after having it for around 10 months, no big deal. The new mouse I bought does not hold a charge for very long at all. I can charge it for an hour or two and it dies after about 30 minutes. Next time I will buy another product.",2021,07
This is an amazing mouse! I would definitely buy again!,2021,07
It jus dies really quick but Mabye that’s cuz I leave it on and walk away cuz when I’m done using it I like to walk back into my room with it still on but otherwise I love it,2021,07
It was nice until it stopped working.  The return window literally closed yesterday,2021,07
Cool,2021,07
I’ve been wanting a mouse for a while and I’m glad I purchased this one. I use it to game and edit my videos and it really comes in handy. It’s better than than track pad and any other mouse in my opinion.,2021,07
"The mouse definitely makes a difference when it comes to the clicking sound. Everyone is glad there is no more of that! It’s slim, rechargeable, and decent looking!",2021,07
"It functions very well as a wireless mouse, the USB C adapter it comes with is very handy for the new Apple computers which only have USB C ports. The lights are cool as well, but more importantly the mouse is sturdy and doesn't feel cheap.",2021,07
Quiet & precise.,2021,07
The mouse does not hold a charge . It goes dead within 24 hours .,2021,07
I had initially given this 5 stars BUT it stopped charging after a couple of weeks.....asked for a replacement and received a different version of the one I initially had that never held a charge. Returning BOTH of them for a refund.,2021,07
"I was super exited about this product for my laptop, sadly it didn’t even work after a week. I tried everything to get this mouse to work, charging for two days, try it on a different computer. Nothing helped. The mouse didn’t even use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements.",2021,07
"My stapler has destroyed uncountable mouse's by stapling through the cord. That is one headache I'll not miss. Thank you, it's a wonderful product.",2021,07
Bought this for an office laptop.  It works great!,2021,07
"I don't like the sleep mode if that's what it is that makes me have to press the button every time I want to use it again.  I'd rather it just stay on.  Also, it has to be recharged every 3 days and I'm not a big computer user so that's a pain because I have to change the cord and USB every time.",2021,07
Battery only lasted 2 hrs after fully charged. Not recommend. Returning it.,2021,07
I love the sleek design and silence of it. Helps out alot when doing school at night and the lights around the side make it fun,2021,07
The sleek design is perfect! Easily slips into briefcase without being too bulky and the sleep mode is awesome,2021,07
"It’s perfect for me, thin I need a GPS tracker though, the kids want it.",2021,07
I got the pink one. I love it.,2021,07
"I was really excited about this mouse.  It arrived and worked perfectly for about a week and now it refuses to respond.  I have tried charging it (it's currently plugged into my computer, as the instructions specify, but it's dead to the world).  I have tried all of troubleshooting suggestions but you can't troubleshoot something that won't turn on for love or money.  So, for one week I was happy.  Now I'm just irritated and disappointed.  Don't bother spending the money, no matter how awesome it seems.  You'll just be let down.",2021,07
I got it cause I was tired of replacing batteries on my prev mouse.  Works well and charge lasts over a month with regular use (50 hours a week).,2021,07
"The stupid lights cannot be turned off. It runs the battery flat every night. If you forget to recharge the mose you are sunk in a single day. It is uncomfortable and decides you have released a mouse key by itself. Very annoying, it is in my rubbish bin.",2021,07
Has problems charging and rarely works,2021,07
Did not work at all,2021,07
The mouse is comfortable to use with its very slim low profile. Its accuracy is normal or average to the regular computer user.  Mine did not come with the type C receiver. I assume it was sold once before and not checked to see if all parts were there before reselling. The most annoying thing about the mouse is having to charge over and over again. You have to remember to plug it in everyday for the user who is on the his or her computer a lot. There is no meter to check for how much battery is left and can be annoying when it starts being erratic because it needs juicing up. It seems to go into sleep mode really quickly so you will have to click a button to start moving again...a slight annoyance.  Not a bad mouse for the price but the annoying things about it have me going back to replaceable battery ones that I am used to using.  The colors are nice and pretty but you get over that really quick.,2021,07
Love my mouse. Love that it comes with the USB adapter. It was very easy to instal. Works perfectly.,2021,07
love this mouse. and the fact it goes to sleep of i forget to turn it off. even better i don't have to worry about batteries.,2021,07
"Works great. Only have to charge it once every 2 weeks, and I use it daily at the office.",2021,07
"My only issue is the color changing lights. I thought there would be an option to turn the LED lights off, have the light be one color, anything… but nope. It’s a disco the whole time. Not a bad thing I guess but also not great?",2021,07
"Bought these because it is rechargeable, however, the power ran out so quick! I need to charge it at least once a week!My previous mouse use batteries and I didn’t  need to change it for at least half of a year!",2021,07
"It barely lasts a few hours before having to recharge it, which is annoying. I think it is because of the LED lights, which drain the power.",2021,07
The product is as shown in the picture,2021,07
"This is great for remote work or personal use. True to description!!! Silent, sleek and easy to use. Bang for your buck for sure!!!",2021,07
I bought a pink one and the color is just so cute. It's very easy to use: plug the dongle into the usb port and the mouse works immediately. It also has multi-colored lights to help you from getting bored while working/studying. I really like this product and high recommend for people who are looking to buy a mouse with reasonable price.,2021,07
Great Value,2021,07
"small mouse, but no batteries.",2021,07
Excellent mouse. It's really handy and helped me a lot in my academic work. I am already a big fan of it!,2021,07
Works great with my MacBook Pro. Perfect for regular use.,2021,07
"Love the lights, easy carry.",2021,07
"Ok, my trackball that I've had for 10 years is dying, so I went back to the mouse.  You can spend over $100 on a mouse, but unless you are a hardcore gamer, and even then, probably not worth it to be honest, so I went with this affordable mouse.  Totally works. it is VERY thin, I think I would have liked a little more meat on it, maybe even for it to be a big heavier, but it's $12 so it's worth it.  I recommend.",2021,07
"I really like this mouse-pretty, catchy color (rose gold); and it maneuvers so gentle and smoothly.",2021,07
I love how it lights up and is comfortable for for my hand!,2021,07
I purchased this for daily use. Although the design and colors were neat ended up breaking. This is not a durable mouse not usb. Another downfall is the light in the mouse could be blinding at times. The mouse dropped once and broke.,2021,07
Excellent mouse for the price,2021,07
I don't like the fact I have to charge it to use it.  It's a pain if I don't remember to plug it in.,2021,07
This mouse meets all my needs and it looks so cute among my setup. I love the RGB lights it projects and how smooth and quiet the clicks are. Definitely recommend!,2021,07
I love it.  I would recommend.,2021,07
Easily hooked up to my laptop and works like a charm!,2021,07
Not sure if the one I got was just defective but the tracker did not seem to work very well. As an analyst I need something with a smooth path and this mouse started/stopped very abruptly.I had to return it.,2021,07
"I was super excited for this mouse. Its so sleek and small, it was perfect for me. Unfortunately it doesn't work all that well. Its super glitchy, especially when you turn it on color mode. It lags and sometimes it doesn't even click on what you're trying to click on. Its much easier to just use my mouse pad on my computer.",2021,07
"I loved the design and cool light features, but true to the old saying... you get what you pay for.  This mouse was pretty bad.  It jumps and skips all over the page and you have to click the left mouse button 2 or 3 times before it responds to your request.  Very frustrating to say the least.  Not a good buy...",2021,07
"It's the cutest mouse. I like how sleek it is, and the colors change all the time. Charge up the mouse and it lasts a long time. Now that I have a pink mouse, it's time to find a pink keyboard.",2021,07
I love it and the multicolored,2021,07
"Love the pretty lights, just wish that the charge would last longer. Still, even with pretty long hours of gaming and accidentally leaving it on, the battery lasts a solid 12 hours. Would recommend, good for the price that's for sure",2021,07
"I had to replace my mouse and decided to try this mouse out since it had a lot of reviews. It works great!The mouse looks good and has a sleek design. The LED lights are a fun touch and the DPI feature is nice to have. I had zero issues connecting the mouse to my MacBook wirelessly to with the USB-C port.What I did notice was my hand started to feel uncomfortable with only an hour of use. Coming from a mouse that had an arch in the design, this mouse was a little flatter than that.Another are the clicks and scrolls. It definitely is not quiet when it comes to clicking and scrolling. It's not loud like compared to regular mice, but it is louder than my previous quiet mouse.I did end up returning the mouse, but I would still recommend this to those who like this mouse design. It's still a great mouse overall.",2021,07
"Horrible piece of trash, worst mouse ever, don't buy this.",2021,07
Works great. Nice and smooth feel,2021,07
It’s flimsy and the battery doesn’t last long you constantly have to charge and you can’t put batteries waste of money,2021,07
Product was defective.,2021,07
"This is the second wireless mouse I purchased - both the same.  The first one works great - have had it for a while and love the look and feel.  The second one started sticking and locking up shortly after purchasing.  It's hit-or-miss - some days it's fine, other days I want to throw it out the window!",2021,07
"At first i just loved the mouse and it was so pretty when I turn on the lights. But when it was time to recharge, and it just never recharged, and I tried and tried for well over a day.  Its dead and only two weeks old.  So disappointed. So I will be purchasing another wireless mouse from another company instead.  Simply not worth my time to fuss with returning etc.",2021,07
"This mouse works very well, holds a good charge and is easy to connect and transport as I travel quite a bit.",2021,07
Nice,2021,07
Returned it,2021,07
Does not work at all. Lights come on but it doesn’t connect to dongle and does nothing.,2021,07
I thought it was fantastic at first. Wirked great for me at work. Now the wheel keeps popping out of place and doesnt work.,2021,07
"This mouse captures the eye because of the constant changing colors. I also like the feel of it, it's not bulky and big. I think its a great investment, good for kids and gaming :-)",2021,07
The mouse is very easy to use and automatically connected to the computer. I would definitely recommend this mouse to others.,2021,07
Easy to set up and it’s definitely quite.,2021,07
I/10 Do not recommend.  This mouse worked all of 2 days.  I changed the batteries and it still does not work.  Spend your money on a basic mouse that works.,2021,07
"Don't waste your time with this mouse. I got this mouse for my work because the wireless mouse that I had was loaned to me. Straight from the box, it didn't even work. It will light up red whenever I turn it on, it won't connect to my MAC at all even with the c port installed. It wouldn't work. AT ALL. I switched it off and on. I replugged in the c port. nothing would work. What a waste of money.",2021,07
It stopped working after about 2 weeks even after being fully charged.,2021,06
"This is user friendly, works well and holds a charge for a long time. I would buy it again",2021,07
Great mouse definitely got my money worth,2021,07
Love this item works great never needs batteries light portable,2021,07
Colors are fun. But it doesn’t react great. Charge doesn’t last long if you forget to turn it off over night.  When it’s low on battery it doesn’t work well. Overall it’s an inconvenience.. amending my review to include the following.  If you post a bad review the company hassles you by email to take it down. First by offering a refund. When you tell them not interested they then offered 30 bucks. You can’t pay me to take a review down.  That’s the point of a review. Just make a better product.  You should just refund me.,2021,07
Battery won’t charge. I guess you get what you pay for. Save the 15$ or whatever this cost is and invest in something better.Wow. Don’t trust these other reviews guys. If you write a bad review aka the truth they will ask you to delete it. If the product doesn’t work obviously people are going to say something. Save your money people and buy from someone else that is better quality.,2021,07
"UPDATE: SELLER HAS SENT MULTIPLE EMAILS ASKING ME TO REMOVE THIS REVIEW IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY, CLAIMING ""This is an email from Amazon costumer service.""This is the 2nd purchase for me.  The first one wasn't labeled ""Upgrade.""  It lasted about 6 months until I dropped it on the floor.  This one, the ""Upgrade,"" doesn't work well at all.  The left and right click are very touchy and the scrolling drags and skips across pages.  The connectivity was also delayed.  Despite trying different computers and different settings, the problems persisted.  Returned the ""Upgrade.""",2021,07
"This mouse is fun!  It works well, keeps it’s charge and is nice to watch.",2021,07
May as well just leave it connected to the computer. Needs constant recharging…,2021,07
Product doesn’t stay connected,2021,07
14 Days of usage and Dead. Will not charge anymore but it worked great for 13 days.,2021,07
I've had this for a few weeks and it's already useless - it won't charge when connected. Horrible!,2021,07
It disconnects at times requiring you to unplug the USB connection and reconnect.,2021,07
This product works great very lightweight and smooth easy to and  use easy setup the lights on it makes it look so neat. I definitely recommend this product.,2021,07
This mouse is ridiculously cheap. Do not buy! Garbage!!!!!!!,2021,07
"I mean, this is a wireless mouse that has pretty lights and stuff, but I swear it doesn't catch well and I have to slide it like a pro curler. Either it dies really fast or it just decides to stop properly working, not sure what the true issue is. I like the texture and how sleek it is, but when it doesn't properly work, it drives me absolutely nuts. I even got a mouse pad and it still gives me issues...",2021,07
good product but the recharging part is inconvenient,2021,07
"Love the slim design, easier on the wrist. The buttons have good feedback as well.",2021,07
Works great!,2021,07
Amazon increasingly started to provide no name/no SN/no model description (= poor quality) merchandise which fail to operate out of the box.  They may or may not function.,2021,07
"Ehh it’s ok, a good hold me over",2021,07
This mouse was amazing. Two weeks after I received the mouse it went nuts.  If you move right it goes down left it goes up. Does not work right it takes more time to figure out what it is doing than actually functioning.  Worst mouse ever.,2021,07
The ball already broke.,2021,07
I loved my mouse and it worked great I loved the light show and the fast response time with no lagging from the mouse then at 2 weeks into having the mouse the type c reciever that made the mouse work broke off i was so bummed because i really liked the mouse so i took a leap of faith and contacted the company to ask for a replacement on just the receiver so that i could use my mouse and they immediately apologized for the inconvenience and sent me a brand new set at no cost a lovely lady named Iris helped me out. Thank you for being an honest company that stands behind the products you sell I'm a customer for life !!!!! Don't hesitate to buy this item you wont regret it.,2021,07
"IUPDATED:  (11-13-21). Returned and bought another as I really liked the way it fit my hand, etc.  The first one didn’t get charged til it was out and then wouldn’t recharge after it died.  I’ve plugged this one to charge more frequently and am happy to keep it.  Not going to let it die cuz don’t want to suffer finding out it’s a design flaw.  On the other hand, could have just been the one I first bought. I am so disappointed.  I received my pretty mouse, charged it and love it!  Fits my small hands, no clicking sounds, easy to use.  I received it around July 10.  Today is July 25 and the cursor won't work!!  I hadn't charged it so I plugged it in to charge.  The wheel still works but the clicker won't work.  When I press it, nothing happens.  I would exchange it for a new one but then I don't have many days left to see if it works and really don't want to take a chance on losing my money.  These mice seem to work great for some and don't work for some.  I may figure out which credit card gives a year warranty beyond the normal one which is non existent.  At least I could try again.",2021,07
"I bought it for my daughter and she loved it. This mouse is very light, well designed and easy to use. Light-up is also a very nice feature.",2021,07
I bought this mouse for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Would defiantly recommend this mouse and would purchase again especially for the price.,2021,07
Brought for work and very satisfied,2021,07
the wheel stopped working after 3 weeks,2021,06
Worked great for about a month and then the button stopped clicking properly or at all.,2021,07
It is too small for average size hand. The mouse literally disappear in your hand. I used it for 10 minutes and it was very uncomfortable. My fingers do not rest on the buttons. They go over it. But The design and functionality is good. You will enjoy using this mouse if you have small hands.,2021,07
The adapter didnt work even though it said it would work with Mac airs… 😕☹️,2021,07
"Started off good. About 2 weeks in, it wouldn’t move. Fully charged.",2021,07
Love the color and led lights.,2021,07
I really like this mouse.,2021,07
"Works perfectly, colors are fun.  Still running on the first charge but I do turn it off if I'll be away from the computer for long.",2021,07
 It rechargeable and automatically goes to sleep mode when not using. Easy to use. Works great.,2021,07
"Love it iv had it for about 4 months now, and I can only recall  1 time it went dead. It wouldn't have went dead if it weren't  for me neglecting to charge it but it left on for a couple days. Other then that its a great mouse. I use it almost everyday and I only find myself charging it  about  once a month.",2021,07
Love everything about it!,2021,07
It fills the bill. Not too expensive. works fine.,2021,07
"It is the loudest mouse I have owned so far. It makes a weird internal noise that is a high pitch hum. The clicks are super loud. The scrolling is loud. It works great with a MacBook and does what is is suppose to but way too loud for me. Overall, not a fan and wouldn't recommend.",2021,07
" The mouse is very bright in the dark. I love the aesthetic of it. It’s very sleek and looks nice with my laptop. The battery lasts pretty long,(it stays on red when you need to charge it). Love that it is rechargeable so no need for batteries.",2021,07
Lasted about a week,2021,07
Big fan of this mouse. Works great and used for 5 strait days without needing a charge.,2021,07
Very easy to use and efficient!!,2021,07
Bought as a gift. She loved it.,2021,07
The mouse hooks up easily and does what it's advertised to do. Hassle-free.,2021,07
"This mouse is very light weight but not in a good way. It's so light it actually feels cheap. It takes a lot of getting use to because it is so light. After about three weeks, the mouse started to intermittently stop working. Now it's has fully stopped working after only a month. Pay the $2 more and get the Microsoft one. I've had that one for 4 years and never had an issue.",2021,07
"This was pretty frustrating to use, it kept shutting off and the tracking was pretty awful. I ended up throwing it away after about two weeks worth of use.",2021,07
As described,2021,07
"It started out great for about 2 days... now it works for 5 minutes and won't ""move"" the cursor around.",2021,07
I love this mouse very easy to use.  I love the way the lights change color it just makes working a brighter place,2021,07
"I was super excited when I received this mouse with it’s comfort and of course, the pretty LED lights were cool. It came fully charged & worked great UNTIL after I charged it for the 1st time. Strange—it no longer worked! I could see a bit of red inside but the LED’s were gone and the curser wasn’t responsive to the mouse. Against better judgement I agreed to receive a free replacement giving it another chance— so I’ll follow up with a 2nd review!FOLLOW UP: 2nd one worked for 2 weeks and then STOPPED WORKING altogether. The company actually contacted me after submitting my initial review, offering full reimbursement if I’d take it down, followed by instructions on how to do so. I didn’t end up doing it & glad for it since this one was even worse! Ughhh, why do companies insist on selling products like this?!",2021,07
"I received this on a Friday and let it charge all day Saturday. Loved how it looked, the lights were fun.  It was, however, very flat and small.  I started using it on Monday... it was amazing; so quiet, so pretty. Here it is Wednesday, the lights no longer work and it is already dead.  Yes, I did power off every night. I'd much rather use a battery operated mouse.",2021,07
"I was tired of using a wireless mouse that needed change of batteries to quickly.  Lucky i found these wireless rechargeable mouse.  The first thing i did when the package arrived was to charge the mouse fully.  So far is working without problems.  The mouse is slim and very comfort.  The multicolored LED is a delightful touch that will be an excellent companion to the multicolored led mouse pad.  My review is based on regular use, i can't have opinion regarding how the mouse works for gaming because i just a controller for that.**update**After just a few months the surface of the mouse looks like is peeling and is very noticeable, even with proper cleaning.  The mouse keeps working and the LEDS.",2021,07
"Feels great, sleek. Different colors for different laptops, nice.",2021,07
Mouse does not take a charge when it dies. I do not recommend this product to anyone.,2021,07
"Initially I charged this mouse overnight and then used it for two eight hour days, turning it off overnight. A couple hours into using it on day 3 it died. I charged it for several hours and it has no juice and won't even turn on. I would think after a couple hours of charging it would at least turn on.",2021,07
"Love this! Very sleek, very quiet and I actually love the lighting on the sides. I have had no issues. Plug and play!",2021,07
Im giving this a 3 because i got one in Black for my sister and she hasnt had any issues. I bought one in blue and the left click sticks. Not sure if it was dropped at some point prior to me receiving it or if there is inconsistent quality with the product. At the price its not worth the hassle of returning it to get a replacement.,2021,07
Love it! It’s so sleek and comfortable to use. Love the color and the light changing aspect!,2021,07
Stopped working and wouldn’t re-charge after a few weeks. Threw it away.,2021,07
"that was my first review but the mouse did not work.  the seller replaced it immediately and that one works fine.  again, be aware that this is a rechargeable mouse and you cannot replace the batteriesThe seller should’ve been clearer that this is a recharging mouse and I don’t know how you replace the rechargeable batteries so that’s the only complaintOtherwise it’s a great mouse",2021,07
"I gave up my mouse for this ""new"" mouse because it didn't work on the other laptop to make them happy. It would just stop working. Ordered a replacement on another review. Amazon refunded my money.",2021,07
I love this mouse! Not only is a silent mouse but it is light and also changes colors on the side. So far I have received compliments from my coworkers. They said it's a fancy mouse 😁,2021,07
It came quick,2021,07
"This is a compact, slim mouse.  I wouldn't call it ergonomic, just efficiently sized.  I just opened it, and I already hate it.  It isn't silent, the buttons are loud, and non-responsive.  I've had to click multiple times to get a response from the mhouse, and only a heavy loud click works. I'll be returning, and will continue the hunt for a replacement mouse.  It does look cool, but performs poorly.",2021,07
I like the design I love it,2021,07
"To charge, I have to press down on the cord where it plugs into the mouse and hope for the best. Scroll wheel clicks are loud.",2021,07
"I love the look, the colors, and it fits my hand grip perfectly……Awesome device!",2021,07
It's slim and doesn't make noise. The colors are great. I wasn't expecting much but this mouse really surpassed what I thought I was going to get. To install is super easy. The USB is small so it doesn't get in the way. The mouse is super slim and the scroll works great.,2021,07
I like the fact that I don’t have to change batteries and just plug it into the connector. I do jigsaw puzzles on line and it works great,2021,07
I love this mouse! I needed something to help me enjoy working back in the office and this really helps my mood!,2021,07
"So far the mouse charges, connects, tracks, scrolls, and left-clicks fine, and the LED lights are nice.The right-click doesn't work, which is something I use often at work. I have to use the right-click on the mouse pad on my laptop, which is inconvenient.",2021,07
This mouse is great. It connected easily to my windows laptop as well as to my girlfriend's imac. I love that the clicking is quiet. I think I will get another one so we can each have one. The lights are cool but I am glad there is a switch to shut them off. That is actually a great feature.,2021,07
This is the worst purchase. Mouse doesn’t work. I have charged it multiple times and it loses connection. I would not purchase this model.,2021,07
"I bought this for my home office. I usually had to change the mouse batteries once in 2months because I always forget to turn off the mouse when I am not using it. Now with this one I don’t have to worry about all these things, just recharge and use it.",2021,07
"Can i just say, wow. This mouse is absolutely incredible. The wireless feature and led lights make this thing a steal for its price. It is super helpful when i want to stay in bed but still use my pc from afar. I can just pull this bad boy out and start going. It has silent clicks to it as well so you wont be waking or bothering anybody buy using this mouse. And with its low profile shape and structure, it takes up practically no room whatsoever!",2021,07
"Scrolling is very easy and quick.  This mouse is slim and easy to Manuver.  I mostly love the ergonomic and backlighting design.  The sleep mode feature is nice, just have to remember to turn the mouse off, then on, to reactivate the scrolling feature.",2021,07
"Sleek, quite & cool light effect. Great price for a rechargeable mouse & no more batteries to replace.",2021,07
Really cool wireless mouse! I especially love the perfect ergonomic size and design AND the cool lights!,2021,07
Had to exchange first one after a month. Replacement was fast and easy,2021,07
It does not recharge,2021,07
" I just Love the colors. It is comfortable on your wrist. Great size, fits great in my slim laptop case.",2021,07
This is awesome I didn’t know it lit up different colors ( was just in a hurry online shopping) glad I got this works great,2021,07
I love itttttt,2021,07
It half works. I have to charge it a TON and I leave it off if I’m not using it. It also goes to sleep quick and takes *forever* to wake up. I’m not sure if I would order from them again.,2021,07
Mouse only last 2 hours after charging.,2021,07
Cool mouse I like it changes colors while using it LOVE THE FACT I NEVER HAVE TO USE BATTERIES AGAIN FOR A MOUSE.,2021,07
I like this for school,2021,06
This mouse is good quality for a low price. I love the multi-colored LED lights on the side and middle. I chose the blue and feel like it adds a pop of color to my office! However- the blue paint is already peeling on the bottom and I've only used it a little while. Not sure if it came like that or is already wearing. There are probably other products for a similar price that could be better quality.,2021,07
"Cutest, stylish, clean looked mouse. I have white monitor and white keyboard it goes very well with those. Also it has lights and it’s super comfortable ergonomic. I’m happy with this purchase",2021,07
"The first day I received the product it worked very well, though I couldn't get seem to get it to charge. It had enough juice to get through the first day so I wasn't too concerned. By the second day, though, something had happened to the optical portion because moving the mouse often wouldn't move the cursor (and never moved it as fast as it should). The buttons all seem to work fine still, but without the ability to actually move the mouse as I want to it's pretty useless.",2021,07
"Works great! Color just like into the picture. The best thing is that it’s charge last for a very long time, I don’t have to charge it everyday!",2021,07
The mouse didn't work after the first few hours of use. Troubleshooting didn't work.,2021,07
It's basically junk doesn't hold a charge it works fine as long as its plugged into the charger but that defies the purpose of a wireless mouse,2021,07
Works very well but wish it had option for regular battery.,2021,07
Quit working after 2 weeks of use,2021,07
I love this mouse. If you have smaller hands or like a mouse that doesn’t feel to big in your hands then this is for you. The color and lights are a cool touch as well.,2021,07
Like the mouse but having to recharge it with USB all the time is annoying and unproductive.,2021,07
I like very easy to install and the color change on the mouse,2021,07
"for my laptop , iI got it on May 9th 2021 it did work for two months , and now it will not been chargeI can't use it anymore , I need to get a new one",2021,07
The mouse is very pretty and lights up.  Pretty silent when in use.  Its small in size,2021,07
"Confortable to use, silent clic and battery lasts a lot",2021,07
Everything arrived and performs great.,2021,07
Doesn't hold a charge very long.,2021,07
From the day I received all my touchpad headaches are gone. A wonderful product that keeps me enjoying the clicks without any noise. No headache of battery life. Recharge and go mouse that signals more than 10meters distance. The color attracts and keeps me cool during operation.,2021,07
"My granddaughter wanted this wireless mouse for her computer. It is SILENT when clicking. She likes that the colors change on the side when using it. Overall, she is happy with it.",2021,07
 Sleek design and very responsive.  And most 9f all it sleeps when you're not using it.,2021,07
Like this mouse work good,2021,07
"It's exactly as bad as I should have expected for the price. I've had it for 3 days and it will randomly stop working. I have to turn it off and on again to get the mouse to begin working again. The plastic it's made out of is cheaper than it looks in the picture. Honestly, I should have spent a few more bucks and bought something better.",2021,07
I like my new mouse. I needed an inexpensive yet durable mouse and this one has been great so far. I have only used it for a day but so far so good. Great purchase.,2021,07
"It's a cool mouse, but I don't think it's worth the price. Whenever I use it, my curser ocassionally jerks around the screen and makes it difficult to use. It's not my computer's fault because I switched mouses and the other one works fine. Also, the color changing lights are see-through from the top (I got a white one) and it kind of ruins the feel. It just feels really cheap. Honestly though, if it was maybe $5 cheaper and it didn't glitch the curser I'd say it's worth it. I like how you can charge it rather than switching out batteries, and I like how it comes with a lightning USB adapter.",2021,07
"Love this little guy! The colors are fun, they change everytime the mouse moves! Helps you to remember to turn it off! Easy to charge with USB, glides smooth! Totally love it!",2021,07
"Worked great for a month. Mouse connects via a USB receiver. I've only disconnected the receiver a few times when not using the mouse. However, after disconnecting a few times, I can't reconnect the receiver without it being ""loose"": the instant my mouse connects, it will disconnect because the USB is too loose now. After a MONTH.Edit: Customer service reps have reached out to me, offering me money to delete my review.",2021,07
"I like the change in color but this is definitely not a gaming mouse. I needed an alternative to keep me in the works so I chose something that was cheap and nice looking. Its silent and has a nice speed to it, not too much sensitivity.",2021,07
"This Mouse was Amazing when i first got it and it worked amazing for the first few months. Then i started having connecting issues, so i direct hooked it up to my PC and it worked like that for a Day. Now it Doesnt work at all. Dont Waste your money on this.",2021,07
I needed a wireless mouse and specifically wanted one that matched my new laptop. This mouse exceeded my expectations. I love the that it lights up and comes in a variety of colors. It's kinda hard to find a silver mouse especially one that is compatible with a Type  C usb so I am happy.,2021,07
"a waste of my money, doesn’t even charge on my laptop. But hey, guess you get what you pay for cause this is crap.",2021,07
works like a charm,2021,07
looks so cool,2021,07
"Started out pretty good but after about 3 weeks the mouse no longer tracks properly. Even after charging all night, after about 1 to 2 minutes of use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements.",2021,07
Wasn’t sure I’d like the smooth style of the mouse but I love it! Gonna buy one in another color as a backup just incase,2021,07
This is a great & economical mouse. Love the colored LED lights and works perfectly. Great deal!,2021,07
Very easy to set up! Works perfectly fine with my MacBook Air.,2021,07
"Beautiful LEDs, mouse works great.",2021,07
"Great product, very easy to use and understand, sleek design too!",2021,07
The click wheel stopped working two days after the return window. The colors are pretty. It's a fun mouse but pretty basic.  I would not buy this again,2021,07
I love the light on the side that’s what draw my attention to this beautiful mouse . And I have been looking fir a quite mouse for awhile and this is it .,2021,07
Great mouse! Speak design. No clicking noises. Really pretty and easy to use!,2021,07
 So far so good.  I had a previous mouse that gave out after 6 months.  And check the cool colors!,2021,07
I love it ! It works perfect and I love that it changesColors if you want 🙏🏻,2021,07
Love how soft and quiet it is. Super happy !!,2021,07
"I like the design; however, the charge does not last long.",2021,07
Love it! Definitely worth the buy.,2021,07
"*Update* Since writing this review they have emailed me twice offering a $10 refund if I took the review down. When I didn’t reply they offered me a $30 refund (?) again in return I would have to remove the review. They stated they were a small company and my review was hurting them… but with over 15,000 reviews, I don’t see how that’s possible…The light goes off like it is charged, however, it won’t turn on more than about 10 seconds. I’ve tried 2 different charging cords and same thing happens. Don’t waste your money.",2021,06
"This was gifted to me as I was in need of a better mouse for working at home. Very comfortable to hold, able to right-click and easy set up. No issues, highly recommend this mouse.",2021,06
nice and smooth. nice to just connect to pc to charge and not get batteries.itd be cool if they had software to control the lightsit goes into standby mode super fast. not a negative or positive trait.,2021,06
"Don't buy it, waste your money.",2021,06
"The mouse is slim, lightweight, and has beautiful colors. The paint has started to rub off and I have only used it for maybe 2 weeks. I can tell it will not last too long.",2021,06
It is ergonomic and love the color.  It works well and is pretty quiet when clicking and scrolling.,2021,06
"Basically bought this for work.  Very light, which is good to use for.  Don’t have to fight with the wired mouse anymore.  Like the light that comes with it, goes with a good gaming system.Overall very well built.",2021,06
"I wish the charger was longer it’s so short. I used it once and the mouse was not calibrated. I had to bang it a couple of times then it worked. Buying a new one, I do not recommend this product.",2021,06
The photo is misleading. Only one color shows at a time.  Mouse is not as accurate as most.,2021,06
"This mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews. It is light, good to hold, and has good battery life. It is also quiet (with exceptions–see below)Its main problem however is that the middle button (the scrollwheel) becomes unusable after only a short amount of use. After which, the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register a button press.Also, compared to the LMB & RMB buttons (which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally), the MMB is extremely rigid in comparison. It is also very noisy, which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent. It is much more noisy than other mice I have used (which is about 20).As someone who relies on this button during daily usage, this is very frustrating, and frankly a serious design flaw. I'd like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well (i.e, not rough). I also bought the non-LED version of this mouse, and the *exact same problem* appeared after the same amount of time.Another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low, leaving one to guess when to recharge it.It often becomes erratic (mouse pointer moves around) and does not register movement well, requiring a power cycle. This is occuring on more than one system.All in all a decent attempt, but quite a few issues need to be ironed out. I doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than a couple of weeks usage, as these issues are consistent and appeared after 2-3 months.Frankly, I expect a mouse to last _significantly longer_, and also have a useable middle mouse button. I hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer.",2021,06
"UPDATE: I have been sent 4 emails from the seller begging me to change my review, 2 of the emails offered me $40 to do so. This explains the positive reviews despite the terrible product.the mouse freezes constantly. left and right click will work but the mouse will not move. this is the worst mouse i've ever had. it also goes into sleep mode after 10 minutes of not being used, which is annoying and no way to turn it off. the light also stays on while in sleep mode which doesn't make sense. the charge doesn't last very long at all, charging it every couple of days.",2021,06
 I just live my cordless keyboard and mouse. They match my HP desktop computer perfectly.,2021,06
"The Good- looks nice and feels good in your hand. The Bad- the right click button is too sensitive, I'm constantly opening up the right click menu. The pointer freezes and I have to turn the mouse off and on to unfreeze it. The Ugly- I ordered a silver mouse and I got dark gray.",2021,06
"So for anyone wondering, charging it is easy. If you plug it and the light in the middle is blue, that means that it is not fully charged. The blue light will turn off after being fully charged. Mine arrived on Monday and on Wednesday it turned off. I plugged it in and took around 2.5 hours to charge it (the light turned off). The clicks are silent and is very comfortable to use. One thing I do not like is the ""scroller,"" which can be a little too hard (I tend to open many tabs at once, at work and while I am on Pinterest lol) but that's just me. Overall, is a nice mouse and I hope it can stay with me forever (this is my 4th mouse in less than a year).",2021,06
"This mouse is a perfect addition to your laptop. It is easy to set up, very affordable, and the ergonomic design reduces hand fatigue.",2021,06
I needed an ultraslim mouse for my laptop and this one works great. My only complaint (if you can call it that) is its length. It would fit better in my carry case if it were shorter.,2021,06
 Awesome mouse is totally silent durable case feels completely comfortable in my hand.  Love the colors.,2021,06
"I like the simplicity and sleekness of this mouse, along with the changing colors. Everything works fine so far.",2021,06
Mine doesn’t change color but it’s slim and works awesome,2021,06
"Seems like a good mouse so far. Good feel, nice weight.",2021,06
I liked the fact it was slim and I liked the lights on it.,2021,06
It’s cute,2021,06
I got this product 2 days ago and everything was working great until I wanted to use my mouse for a different computer only to find out that the casing for drive was stuck in my computer and has no rendered both that usb port and my mouse useless.  The mouse is great in use but now I cant use the mouse or the port until I can find strong enough tweezers to get the piece out.,2021,06
"I bought a mouse for my daughter after she took my mouse while on vacation.  She loves it!  It has a location to place the usb connector while not plugged in.  It has a low profile which looks good with any computer.  A plus, it has a usb-c to usb 3.0 connect along with a usb 2.0 charging cable.  It also has a solid color mode and a changes colors mode.  Good price for a wireless mouse.",2021,06
"Overall, liked the feel and responsiveness but the durability was the big issue.  This mouse was for a work computer with light everyday use, and within less than two months it would no longer charge or work properly.  I  took it apart to verify the battery was making connection, and even replaced the battery.  However, the mouse still would not track properly.  Perhaps, I just got a dud, but decided to spend a few more dollars and purchase a different brand.",2021,06
Love this mouse works perfect,2021,06
"I haven't had any issues at all using this mouse. It feels great, the silent clicks and LED lights add a really cool touch to it as well!",2021,06
It barely works. I went back to the mouse I was using when I bought this (which is on its last leg) and it works 10x better still. Skip this product.,2021,06
I like the fact that you can recharge this mouse.....I spend a fortune on batteries and was looking for something I could recharge and it works great...,2021,06
"Came charged. Has an off, on, and then the color switch. Quiet quick. My favorite mode is that when it’s idle for a while it shuts down and you just click and it comes back to life. Exactly what I wanted. Easy USB charge. Hope it lasts me for a while!!",2021,06
"I bought two of these to use with our laptops. Both computers recognized them right away and we were able to use them easily. I like the variety of colors offered and the lower profile, so my hand doesn't cramp like it has with some other styles. The light up colors are fun. I think it was a good value for the money.",2021,06
It's a nice little mouse - It's actually pretty high quality for how cheap it was,2021,06
Mouse does not hold charge.,2021,06
"Unfortunately I had to return it. It's cute and true the color,  however, it does work for my laptop",2021,06
perfect,2021,06
"THIS MOUSE IS NOT BLUETOOTH COMPATIBLE, USB ONLY",2021,06
Don’t waste your money. Stopped working after 2 days of use. Doesn’t hold a charger either.,2021,06
"It takes too long to wake up and the battery dies quickly.  The instructions were terrible.  I have no idea what the two ON settings are for as they are not addressed at all.  Seems to do what a basic mouse is supposed to do, but i would look elsewhere for a higher quality next time.",2021,06
"Just got a new macbook, it works well with it. Good quality for  the price.",2021,06
"Don’t buy this! I thought it would be convenient not to have to worry about replacing batteries, I was wrong! I used it one day and it hasn’t held a charge since! Huge waste of money!",2021,06
This mouse is really useful for my laptop and it was really easy to sey up. The style and color of the mouse really matches the description.,2021,06
My son uses the mouse for gaming on his MacBook Air.,2021,06
"Is easy to install, ergonomic and functional",2021,06
Bad quality already broke USB stick stopped working,2021,06
"I purchased this wireless mouse to use with a laptop.  I purchased it on Amazon due to the slimness, color, and uniqueness.  I am exceptionally happy with the mouse and would recommend!",2021,06
I love this little mouse. It's so small and sleek and fits in my hand nicely it moves quickly I use several screens at work and it moves from 1 to another without any problem and it's fun that it lights up too.,2021,06
Just q very bad mouse alk around.,2021,06
"I have a lot of back issues which causes me to be up all hours of the night, so to keep my mind off of it I will play on my gaming laptop, and it would drive my wife nuts in the middle of the night hearing the “clicking” of the mouse. I got this yesterday and I ABSOLUTELY love it and so does she… she cannot hear the mouse one bit!!And the led lighting is absolutely beautiful! It goes so well with my backlight keyboard! I would recommend this mouse to anyone!!!",2021,06
I loveeeeeee this mouse it’s so pretty and looks great with my laptop!! It works great and runs very smooth I recommend to purchase!,2021,06
Did NOT work and can't return now! Don't buy!,2021,06
The set up is SO easy - plug in and it’s ready to go. Charges completely in about 2 hours. The rose gold color is really cute.,2021,06
I love the size of the mouse and it is so smooth. I really like this. The design is great on the hand. I would recommend this mouse.,2021,06
"Great slim line wireless mouse. Pairs well with all computers, easy to charge and sleep mode is a plus! Highly recommend",2021,06
"Works well enough. Sleep mode is not great. It REALLY goes to sleep. And the charge does not hold for 7 days. But again, well works well enough. If you're looking for a kinda cool mouse, aesthetically, this will work. The gray is gorgeous.",2021,06
"Looks great, feels comfortable however when lifting the mouse, it would shoot the cursor all over the screen which can be frustrating when playing games or working on detailed spreadsheets.",2021,06
"The major flaw with the mouse for me is that the battery life is almost nonexistent. It lasts only about 2 hours for me. I'm guessing the one I got may be defective because I need to have this plugged in all the time to make it usable. But I can't  work that way. Not factoring in the battery, everything else is great in comparison to other mice in this price range.",2021,06
Jusk ok Good quality,2021,06
Very nice mouse. Enjoy the colorful addition.,2021,06
"I ordered silver and received black, not worth the time to return it but a bit disappointing. Quality/functions as expected",2021,06
Cool looking mouse and dazzling light colors!,2021,06
"I was looking forward to not having to use batteries and not have to worry about wires. It was great at first and I really liked it ... then ... after about a week, the charge did not even last a day and then it quit even charging. Don't waste your money. The only silver lining is that I had used my reward points, so there was no out of pocket.",2021,06
" Feels good in my hand and works well. The roller wheel works as a third button which is important for my work. Colors are pretty and you can turn the lights off so that's a bonus. It charges so no batteries and I'm loving that. The only issue I'm finding is that it goes to sleep very fast. If you wait to long to move it, you have to click the power like next to the roller wheel. Not a big deal just annoying sometimes. Overall I'm happy with it.",2021,06
It came really fast. I got it in one day! It is really sleek and works really smooth. I chose my favorite color of course but I love all the colors the light goes through! I also really like that it has a button to keep the mouse on but turn off the light! And of course it is nice that you can charge it rather than use batteries. The other mouse I have have to use batteries so that was a major selling point for this one!,2021,06
This item was not compatible with my work laptop.  There was no way to connect for charging. The feel was great as it is whaIt I consider a low-rise for my hand and wrist.,2021,06
Works great. I would prefer if it would not light up like a rainbow.,2021,06
Good mouse very smooth,2021,06
Works very well on any surface. Colors flow well. Well worth the money.,2021,06
"This mouse is AMAZING!!! It’s quiet, it lights up, it doesn’t die fast. I love it!!!",2021,06
As soon as I took this out of the box I knew that I was probably going to be sending it back. It looks nice in the picture but it is a piece of cheap plastic. It felt so cheap that I just couldn't even use it I sent it right back.,2021,06
"The design is beautiful, the led lights make the mouse look amazing specially in dark places. I love the fact that it doesn’t make a click sound, it charges very fast and it lasts very long! Great price for such a great product!",2021,06
The mouse stopped working after 30 days!,2021,06
It’s a simple yet sleek looking mouse. I’ve been using it for almost a month and have no concerns about it. I recommend it.,2021,06
I like the way it handles while moving it.  I think it is a little small for a big hand.  It is cute and colorful.  I have not played any games with it yet but I am sure it will be quick and smooth.,2021,06
"I have had this mouse for all of 15 minutes and I am planning on returning it.Honestly it looks nice and I like that it's rechargable.However, it's easily one of the worst I've ever used (I've used probably 50 different models in my career alone). First, clicking the mouse requires much stronger force than any other mouse I've used and on top of that it's very inconsistent. Looking through the gaps where the LEDs show out of I can see the mechanical device which actuates the click is a tiny plastic arm. No chance that will lasts for an expected period of time.It seemed to have been packaged fine, so I don't believe it was damaged or DOA.Don't buy this.",2021,06
It’s sleek and comfortable and the battery lasts forever once charged!!! It’s great! And it fits anywhere!,2021,06
This is a great value mouse. I purchased it to go with my new laptop so I didn’t have to depend on the trackpad. The design is nice and colors are a great addition.,2021,06
" I just needed a simple mouse for a desktop I only use for watching videos in my living room. Its super quiet and lightweight, no lag. I'm also using it for cricut designspace, with no issues.",2021,06
It's light and lights up so nifty,2021,06
Didn’t work after 2 days,2021,06
"This mouse works very well and has a very long battery life, very happy with this purchase.",2021,06
Works very well thanks.,2021,06
"It’s cute & pink & is just like the picture! It’s a really nice mouse, but I’m sad that it doesn’t work with my iPad. I put photos of the manual, and it says that mouse needs a USB-port to operate. I think that black USB goes into computer and communicates with the one beneath the mouse.",2021,06
"Mouse only worked half the time, then never held a charge.",2021,06
**Update**After using the mouse for around 4 days it just completely stopped working. The lights come on and it appears to charge but the buttons no longer work and the optical lens doesn't pick up any movement. Don't even bother with this. It's trash.Not a very reliable mouse.  After just a couple days of use it stops working intermittently which is frustrating. I wouldn't purchase again. That said it is a very quiet mouse with no audible click and it's a good size.,2021,06
"It's a soft click, which I like. Love the colors and I truly get about 2 weeks of using it as my work mouse.",2021,06
"If you only need to use a mouse for no more than an hour, this might be okay. I bought 3: 1 for my office, 1 for my laptop bag, and 1 for home. They do not hold a charge.",2021,06
love it,2021,06
Automatically sets up.,2021,06
"I bought this mouse recently for a new laptop I bought and it is perfect! The mouse is an extremely portable, wireless mouse. It actually feels very comfortable while using it. Theres no side buttons or extras on it, just a simple, portable mouse that cna connect via USB or with the included USB-C to USB adapter. I recommend this mouse because of the price and what you get for it!",2021,06
Battery life lasts an exceptionally long time.,2021,06
Stopped working after 2 weeks. Would not buy again.,2021,06
"The features on this mouse are really good.  It worked well initially but after only 3 days, it wouldn't work anymore and ended up in the garbage.  I do not recommend buying this one.",2021,06
I would definitely buy this again. I really enjoy this mouse.,2021,06
"The USB got stuck in my computer as soon as I put it in. Decided to put up with it, hoping the mouse would last and I wouldn’t have to worry about it. It worked for maybe a month total, then completely stopped working and wouldn’t charge.",2021,06
Did not work on my computer,2021,06
Fast charging and super smooth to use!,2021,06
 I wanted to find a very nice and stylish mouse and ran across this one. It was so very easy to connect to my laptop and very lightweight. I love the colorful light display. I've been using the wireless mouse for a few days and it appears to hold a good charge. You can't go wrong with this charger and the price was very reasonable compared to other brands with the same capabilities.,2021,06
This product works great! I got a new laptop and needed a mouse and the look of this was just what I wanted. The features are easy to use and it charges quickly. Would definitely recommend this product.,2021,06
Works fine! Compact and charged in a flash.Would definitely recommend. Really like the LED light.,2021,06
"Great mouse, especially for the price. The LED lights are awesome!!! Works perfect, and easily connects to your device!!",2021,06
This needs to charge very often. I wish I knew that before purchasing.,2021,06
Great wireless louse. Easy to connect and the charges lasts all day,2021,06
Stopped working for no apparent reason,2021,06
Works great. Highly recommend this product. Nothing to dislike.,2021,06
"the mouse works great except the right button doesn't always copy paste on various web pages. After receiving the new mouse, the problem is the web page design because the same problem occurs. I tried a different brand mouse with the same result.",2021,06
Works great in laptop. Very aesthetically pleasing. Ready to use and install,2021,04
"I love that I do not need batteries !! It recharges fairly quick !!Slim design , fits my had perfectly !! I also love I can turn it off !!",2021,06
I like this mouse but the battery literally died in a day.  Charging it now see how long that takes.  I say 50/50,2021,06
Even with sleep mode the battery doesn’t last a full work day.,2021,06
"Love how quiet the mouse is, love that it came with an adapter for usb-c, love the recharging capabilities, very nice feel in the hand!One thing is, i wish i would have gotten the color that i wanted. I wanted Silver but got Gray. :/",2021,06
Great mouse like the colors and sleekness. Also rechargeable!,2021,06
Feels very cheap and performs cheap too. both sides stick together when wanting to use just the left side button but they both go down and pop wen going back up. difficult to click on just a single item!,2021,06
"Worked fine at first, about a month in and now it gets glitchy for no reason. Flat design makes for poor support of hand. Not for gaming.",2021,06
Used this mouse twice. Went to use it a third time and it was completely dead. The led’s were still working but the mouse light underneath flickers then shuts off after being turned on. Waste of money.,2021,06
"Sleek,  nice and holds charge for a long time.  Definitely recommend.",2021,06
Love it!,2021,06
"Easy, light, inexpensive , quiet and perfect for my new Mac laptop !!",2021,06
"I read the reviews and ordered two.  One for home, one for office.  They both worked great for about 2.5 weeks.  I started having trouble with the charge not lasting.  And then by the time my return window expired, they were both worthless.  I can still plug in and the lights are pretty, perhaps a very weak night light?  That is what the star is for, the pretty lights.",2021,06
"When I received this item it was thin, which is okay but it was also chipped off on the left side. Then, I simple drop and the mouse damn near shattered! And to stop it off, sometimes the cursor goes everywhere, which can be annoying when you’re working on particular items. I love it for the lights and how compact it is. Handle this item with care!",2021,06
"I actually really love this mouse, its slim and quiet.  The multicolored led lights stopped working after 4 days, but it does not affect the quality of it..just a bummer they dont work anymore.",2021,06
"Low profile, feels good in the hand, responsive",2021,06
Constantly had to charge. Cool light effects came at a cost. I ended up going to target and buying a $5 one that works much better and is battery operated.,2021,06
"I like the overall design.  The slim profile and touch is good and the clicks are responsive.Where I'm struggling with this mouse is that as I'm trying to work, there is lag and the mouse will then jump around on the screen.  Also, trying to hold and highlight a group of text, for some reason it loses connection.  what I've ended up having to do is clicking on my document and then using my Shift+Arrow Keys to highlight the text that I need.For general web browsing, this mouse isn't bad.  For productivity, it's not really working for me and i'm going to go back to my wired mouse.",2021,06
Love this mouse. Work excellent!!,2021,06
did not work with my older dell computer,2021,06
"Lightweight, comfortable, and cool with the lights. Rechargable is a major plus",2021,06
I bought this mouse for work and it worked great the first month! However after a month it started working slower and slower and just stopped working. Not a good use of money.,2021,06
"Mouse works, LGB died almost immediately. The only color actively working on this mouse is the red led and the blue when charging. When the mouse is left idle for a minute or two, it seems to desync and takes a minute to ""wake up"". It gets in the way more often than not. Otherwise, okay product.",2021,06
The USB broke off in my computer and I had trouble removing it. I finally got it out with finger nail clippers. I was happy with it until this happened.,2021,06
"The usb charging port was bent & I had to bend back before I could even plug it in to use.  Amazon needs to start labeling the country of origin, I don’t want to support a country that suppresses its people & destroyed a democracy in Hong Kong.  Made in China 🇨🇳 junk.",2021,06
"At first I loved this mouse, it worked great and the battery lasted a long time. But I have bought 2 of these now, and the first one was faulty and this second one has only worked for about 2 months  and now will not connect! This product would be fantastic if it  worked longer that 2 months. But for the price, it's not terrible.",2021,06
"....and differently from the Alienware, I saved about 90 dollars.Love the fact you can switch the LEDs off to save battery, also good battery is rechargeable (although in about 3 weeks I never had to charge it yet) good quality and fun to use.Also awfully cheap, which is always a plus!Not sure if is a good match for gaming, I've used it in the new MS flight simulator and I must say the response was fine...Not sure though if it would be fast enough for the ""kill 'em all"" gamesTotally recommended.",2021,06
"This mouse is light and fits in my hand well.  It's fun to watch the colors slowly change.  However, it does not stayed charged long at all and cannot be used while it is charging.",2021,06
Works great charges fast with cool lighting,2021,06
Mouse is really good for the price. smooth and easy to use. Also the RBG lighting looks perfect with my setup!,2021,06
"Okay, here we go..  I was really excited to get this and try it out. I want to note that I wasn't expecting much since it is pretty inexpensive; however, my excitement didn't last long. The dpi will not change on the one I got, so I changed my mouse settings on my PC. This very, VERY minimally helped. -I couldn't help but laugh while doing this because that curser is sliiiiiiiic......ccccck!For some, this may fit comfortably in their hand, but not mine. Also, it goes to ""sleep"" QUICKLY - as in 5.6 seconds quick. Yes, I timed it.Unfortunately, I'll have to try to return this since I won't use it... ever. By ""try to return it,"" I mean try to actually remember to take it to the post office (or wherever I need to take it) because that never actually happens.In closing, if you have small hands, you're looking for a super slick (meaning super fast) mouse that you may or may not be able to change the dpi, you'll only use it once... maybe twice a year, and you're good at taking your returns where they need to go to get returned, then go for it! Otherwise, maybe look into a different one. Also, I gave 2 stars since is was inexpensive.",2021,06
This was a great mouse for schoolwork and better then using a battery mouse,2021,06
I really like this mouse. Super easy to connect and the charge lasts forever. I swear I charge it once every 1.5 weeks and I leave it on by accident all the time but the sleep mode is great. I recommend!,2021,06
I honestly got this product not so long ago and I can’t really speak about the durability but I wasn’t disappointed with my purchase. The battery last for a very long time and the light it just beautiful.,2021,06
Works excellent. I prefer this mouse over the apple one.,2021,06
"Perfect! Just what I needed. Love that I can use with my Mac and PC. Mouse is smooth, fast, and accurate.",2021,06
" Pretty and sleek. I just opened it, says to charge for 2 hours with USB cable in box.... Umm what cable? Luckily I have plenty of chargers so once I use it, I shall update review.Update, works as it should, love the color changing. No complaint.",2021,06
Works very well. Best part is charging the mouse through power chord rather than batteries.,2021,06
"For work , kids love the colors",2021,06
Excellent thin size. I prefer this new wireless for its thinness and rechargeability.,2021,06
"Battery dies very quickly. Not impressed. Sellers keep harassing me to delete my review! No way, scammers!Buy the below mouse instead. It works great!WisFox 2.4G Wireless Mouse for Laptop, Ergonomic ... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y1KKFBH/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_api_glt_fabc_4GP5QM8PZ805Q7RQZ7QW?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1",2021,06
Center scroll wheel click functionality very spotty after 4 mo of use. Now wheel won’t scroll at all. Disappointing.,2021,06
"I love the feel of this mouse. It is comfortable, easy to set up, rechargeable, wireless and the lights are so pretty! Fast shipping and quality packaging. Would highly recommend.",2021,06
"Love it, great value",2021,06
"I don't use it for gaming that's why I give it three stars for that, haven't used sleep mode and don't plan on it so I gave it three stars not using that either. The three stars for ergonomics is accurate because it could be a little bit taller and we both have tiny hands, will be small for someone with large hands for sure. The colors are nice, Price is Right oh, and we like how it changes colors. I would buy again, adapter that comes with are very convenient, and worth the money I paid just for the adapters.",2021,06
Functional mouse but it is hard to click with fingers - extra effort needed which is not good.  I probably won’t buy this again.,2021,06
excelente,2021,06
Looks great. Comfortable in my hand,2021,06
Didnt last long,2021,06
Works great,2021,06
"Fun mouse for my office! I enjoy it and it’s fun to watch the colors change. A coworker liked it also an plans to purchase one also. I sent her the information. Highly recommend, thank you.",2021,06
This mouse is awesome. The lights are fun and I have owned it 2 weeks and only charged it once and I use it daily,2021,06
Inexpensive!! Love the changing of colored lights,2021,06
"I really liked this mouse, but the battery runs out every few days. I wish the lights would automatically turn off after not being used for a few minutes.",2021,06
"Great product so far. Cool lights. Also, not battery operated, charged with usb cord.",2021,06
Good mouse for the price and the buttons do not make noise so it feels nice when clicking which is a win for me,2021,06
Yes,2021,06
It is super comfy and I love the lights around it. Small enough for my hands.Highly recommend this mouse.,2021,06
Good mouse.  Holds good charge. Perfect for gaming.,2021,06
I really needed a mouse because it is so much easier when working from my laptop. I searched on Amazon and came across this vibrant mouse. I fell in love and decided to buy it. It was the best decision because this mouse is fantastic and works perfectly. I love the color variations and the sleek look. It is easy to setup/use and also easy to charge. It is also wireless which makes it even better.,2021,06
PRODUCT IS EXTREMLY CHEAP. LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM FIVE BELOW OR WISH. YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH IT AND IT DIES REALLY FAST. IM SAD I MISSED THE RETURN WINDOW BUT I WILL BE BUYING A NEW PRODUCT,2021,06
Did not receive the correct cable to charge.,2021,05
"A well-engineered mouse with long battery life, good design, and cutting-edge wireless connectivity. Very easy to set up and use. Recommended!",2021,06
"This is a very good, sleek and easy to use mouse, I really like the colored lights, the charge lasts a long time. I have no cons and I would buy again. I use this wireless mouse with my Dell 5490 All In One.",2021,06
I use a laptop everyday at work and this was a life saver. Very comfortable reliable wireless mouse.,2021,06
Love this mouse and it stays charged for quite awhile,2021,06
"I bought this because of the lights and it looked cool, but it does not have a battery.  It needs to be plugged in to charge.  Unless you babysit it by always turning it off when you are done using it, the charge dies after 2 days and then you have a dead mouse, or one that is now 'wired' as it charges.  Too high maintenance for a mouse.",2021,06
I liked using this mouse but it needed charged a lot more than anticipated. It looks good and worked good but overall was a little too cheaply made and it didn’t last long. It fell (thanks to my small children) and cracked right open. I only got to use it a couple of months.,2021,06
"Very nice smooth feel, fun LED shifting color. Love the silent click feature.",2021,06
"Replaced my boring mouse with this one, wanted something rgb and rechargeable. Love it so far!!!",2021,06
Bought this for work and three hours after turning it on the mouse wheel broke and became unusable.,2021,06
"EASY TO USE! It took less than 30 second to install. It comes with a C charger connecter I didn't need to use it. Take the piece from under the mouse and put it directly in the computer, turn mouse on and use. Real comfortable to my hand, sleek, bright colors,and just a cool accessory to my workspace.",2021,06
I love the light weight fee to this mouse. But unfortunately it doesn’t hold a charge to be able to use it.,2021,06
Works well easy to use stays charged for a long time. Connects easily definitely a good buy for the price,2021,06
I love how the mouse changed colors and the set up was easy just plug and go. The charging was easy as well,2021,06
I purchased this mouse because I needed a new one for my work from home station. I came across this mouse and read some of the reviews and thought I would take a chance on it. It has turned out to be one of the best things I have purchased from Amazon! It is such a smooth operating mouse and the color displays on it are really fun! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in search of a wireless mouse.!,2021,06
The mouse was surprisingly lightweight. I am accustomed to the wireless mice that are battery powered and it makes a huge difference. It is super sensitive too. I was able to use it on fabric and on wood directly without issue. My old mouse required a mouse pad. The lights can be left on or turned off but you still see the red glow of the sensor when lights are turned off. The USB receiver was easily found underneath. It was a bit difficult to pull out but using my nails it came out pretty quick. It also comes with the USB c adapter which you don't see often but I believe it would work with a Chromebook? or maybe with a USB c charger? It has everything I need and it is crazy how lightweight this thing is!,2021,06
"I really like this mouse, I just wish I had a way to know what the battery was at or when it is getting low.",2021,06
The shape is great and the charge really last. unfortunately after 3 months of use the USB connector has stopped working and the USB charger does not connect to the computer it only charges,2021,06
This mouse feels very smooth and lightweight.  Easy to use and one charge seems to last forever,2021,06
exactly what i thought it was gonna be! i use this at work and although the sleep mode can be annoying it does it’s job!,2021,06
Liked the sleek design and that it lights up ☺️,2021,06
"This mouse works like a charm, it is beautiful. The changing colors are fantastically fun!  This fits nicely in my backpack for use with my laptop.",2021,05
I had my mouse for about a week and after using it maybe 5 times. It completely stopped moving around. Only things that works on it is the buttons and the wheel,2021,05
"Awesome and cool, the color turns red when it's time to plug in and recharge.",2021,05
"I love how you don't need a battery , just recharge it! Great and colorfull!",2021,05
Great wireless mouse.  The instructions were easy to follow.  The only thing I wish it did was glow red when it needs recharging.  I will probably purchase another one when this one dies.,2021,05
Love how it looks and feels but out the box it was really glitchy. I charged it and saw that it was still sticking a bit as I was using it. Since it's a mouse the one thing it should do is move smoothly ya know? I don't know if this was just this one mouse or it's how it runs. Either way it's really annoying when you're trying to get things done.,2021,05
"I was looking to buy a portable mouse for travel, and was going to buy a regular battery one but saw this pop up as an option. I really like the mint green color. It’s affordable, easy to use, connects fast, and very low profile. The clicker is quiet too. Scroller works great as well. I charged it up connected via USB to my dock station and it was ready to go. Love it.",2021,05
Used for daily use. Nice product,2021,05
Wasn't terrible but I prefer gaming mice with at least the two buttons on the side,2021,05
 Love it,2021,05
The mouse is light weight and I like the colors. It is also smooth and charge lasts for a while. However I just bought it in May and today in August the usb broke off in the usb port of my computer. The metal part detached from the plastic part. Disappointed.,2021,05
So I bought this a few days ago and the first day of using it which was yesterday (6/8/21) the color changing lights worked and now (6/9/21) only the red light works. This is bs!!! I turned it off for 40 mins to give it a rest but nope the lights still don’t work 2/10 don’t recommend,2021,05
"Very glitch-y.  Curser tracking is not smooth at all.  Silent buttons are almost too sensitive and frequently ""click"" when I'm not meaning to do so.I threw out this item after only 3 days.",2021,05
"Gorgeous and very affordable. The battery doesn't last very long, but it's easy to charge while using.",2021,05
"I was so happy with this mouse when I first got it. Very comfortable, loved the light and most of all the wireless feature. The love affair however was short-lived. After using the mouse for only 2 months it stopped working. I would charge it, it would run for 5 minutes then dead again. It got to the point that the only way the mouse would work is if I kept it plugged - therefore defeating the wireless feature.",2021,05
"Love the design. After two weeks, it has started to fail again (this is my 2nd one). Hoping it's just a fluke!",2021,05
"This mouse was purchased for use with my laptop. I've purchased two of the same brand previously, but wanted something different so I took a chance on this unknown. The mouse is light, and ergonomic - I have a fairly small hand and it fits well. Connection was simple. The sleep mode will definitely increase battery life. Add to this the pretty lights, and lovely rose color...I'm pleasantly surprised! I would recommend this mouse to anyone who wants an inexpensive, and uncomplicated, addition to their setup.",2021,05
Size is just right for me,2021,05
"I like that it recharges and doesn't require batteries.  It doesn't last that long though.  but seems to recharge good enough after only being plugged in for even 5 minutes.  I wish it came with a longer charge cord since you could then use also with charging cable plugged in  ( still can, but very short cord)",2021,05
No batteries needed. This works great and it lites up too. Easy to charge and use. No problems at all.,2021,05
"I bought this mouse in february 2021, it uit working and you relpaced it. Now the new one quit.",2021,05
"Works great, no issues",2021,05
This mouse doesn't work. It either isn't holding a charge or it just isn't connecting to it's own bluetooth.,2021,05
Love that its rechargeable!! Purchased for work computer functions exactly as desired.,2021,05
"Regardless of where you plan to use this product, home, school, or work, you can’t go wrong with this product. It’s a quality product at a great price. I’ve had mine less than a week now, and I just ordered another one.  Add a little light in your life. 😉",2021,05
"The product fits well in my hand and has a quiet click but it keeps on cutting out. I will walk away for a minute and the mouse does not work anymore so I have to unplug it, turn it off, then back on and replug it in.",2021,05
I travel for work so this wireless mouse is perfect. It’s small for packing away and the sleep mode keeps it going longer. I charge it about every 2-3 days.,2021,05
Another lowest bidder production,2021,05
Amazing little mouse,2021,05
"Like it very much! Great price, great performance and cute too!",2021,05
Great item and came so quick. Thank you :),2021,05
Ready to handle,2021,05
Fun little mouse. Doesn’t feel overly sturdy but cute. Lites are fun.,2021,05
"Small, rechargeable and works perfectly.",2021,05
It works great! I love it! My son uses it aswell for roblox,2021,05
"The color wasn’t like the photo. It’s a bit darker than what I was expecting (see photo for reference). I did love that the mouse came with a USB to USB-C adapter. The part that connects to the computer for wireless capabilities was “stuck” so I had to use excessive force to remove it. Only other thing I could change is the LED colors. It goes through series of colors, but it would be fun to be able to choose what color it could be.",2021,05
 I love the fact that this thing is quiet as a mouse(Lol).  I hate the clicking sound on other mouses.  The other thing I love is that it's rechargeable! No batteries.  The only con I could find is that it is not an ergonomic mouse.  That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars.,2021,05
IT TAKES AS MUCH TIME TO CHARGE THE MOUSE AS TO USE IT.  NOT PRACTICAL.  OTHERWISE THE MOUSE WORKSand it is  ERGONOMICAL,2021,05
Stopped working after 2 months. What a waste.,2021,05
"The mouse is comfortable to move. It goes to sleep while in a Zoom/Teams call, however easily wakes up with one click.",2021,05
 Love it plug in and go works on my work computer with no problem will purchase from them again,2021,05
"Quite, cute and very portable",2021,05
Warning....it interferes with other USB devices plugged in to same computer.,2021,05
The last two we bought stopped working within 6 months.,2021,05
Mouse is a great bargain does everything it should do,2021,05
"I was looking for a mouse to replace my old wireless one with which the scroll wheel wasnt working anymore and found this one.  I am pleasantly surprised by this mouse.  The click is very quiet yet there is a satisfying tactile feel to it, though the right click can be a bit sensitive but nothing too major. I think the best feature of this mouse is that it is rechargeable.  Very convenient.  The mouse can be used while charging and only took about 1.5 hours to fully charge.  There is a led indicator that turns off to show when the mouse is done charging.  The mouse will also go into sleep mode after 10 minutes of inactivity to save power.  Overall, great mouse.",2021,05
"I researched Amazon for a wireless mouse and found this one.  I bought it to use with a new laptop.  It works great.  It is responsive, easy to use and saves me time tinkering with the laptops built in mouse.  Another plus is no more batteries to buy.  Happy to have this.",2021,05
" It's not working after setting up to my laptop , but the colors do show up.... I tried to take out the USB and plugging it back again but it doesn't seem to work.",2021,05
Slim and fits comfortably in palm of hand.  I wish that I would have purchased sooner!,2021,05
My son loves it but the instructions are very scary.,2021,05
"Great mouse overall. Very light weight and soundless. LED lights on the mouse work well, too.",2021,05
Colorful,2021,05
Doesn’t stay charged long enough for me.,2021,05
"Beautiful but not sturdy. It comes with a warning ""do not drop"" , well I dropped it...twice! Ugh. It totally won't work now.  I just bought the darn thing less than 2 months ago (passed the return window, of course). Blame me if you want, but it shouldn't be that easy to break!",2021,05
Works great but I don’t like the lights going on when I turn came computer on but does not go off when shutting down,2021,05
"It was fine to use at first, but it stopped working after about a month of using it consistently. Not impressed with longevity.",2021,05
"Great mouse, setup was a breeze, cool rgb changing colors. Long lasting battery!",2021,05
"I really liked this small mouse for my laptop. It worked fairly well, but the tracking wheel soon  developed a squeak that rendered it unusable.",2021,05
It’s really nice and cute mouse. So light and handy.The charging battery it’s really useful,2021,05
The clicks are nice and quiet. The lights are pretty. The battery lasts a long time. It's very simple plug and play.,2021,05
"Nice and light, slight hesitation on click.",2021,05
Product is responsive. The colors are cool. Easy to recharge. So far pleased with purchase. Using for work and not gaming.,2021,05
"Tried on multiple surface and no matter what i do, the pointer is erratic.  It also NEVER goes into sleep mode.  If you fail to turn it off, you will run through the battery in a day.  Awful.  Tried to click on the seller name in an effort to contact them directly, but it was grayed out.  Very disappointed.",2021,05
As the title suggest it stopped working after a week of use. I really liked the feel and look of the mouse so I was pretty happy with it until today when it stopped working. Do not recommend.,2021,05
It's cool and colorful! I love it!!,2021,05
Very nice! I bought 2 love it!,2021,05
"Smooth, wakes with a click and best of all no batteries.  Holds charge all day with constant use",2021,05
This mouse does seem to let you pick a color and the same is not comfortable.,2021,05
This mouse is quite comfortable and silent. Recommended! :),2021,05
This is the second time i purchase this mouse in a matter of a few months and the second one is already not working at all i charged it and all and nothing. I have the rose gold one.Can you guys please send a new one or refund me ? I like the color matches my laptop well but i refuse to keep re purchasing every other few months.,2021,05
I liked the design of this product but after two weeks it stopped working.  I kept having to turn it on and off to get it to track at all.  Disappointed.,2021,05
DOES NOT WORK AT ALL AND WILL NOT CONNECT TO LAPTOP. dont waste your money,2021,05
"I love this mouse, it's so silent and smooth to the touch.",2021,05
The cursor skips all over the place; you have no idea what you're clicking. This mouse is now in my garbage.Buy a different mouse.,2021,05
purchased this March 29th 2021 only lasted 2 months.Was great while it worked but then 2 days ago it just stopped working.I thought I somehow plugged it in wrong and it didn't charge so charged it back up for two days.Went to use it today and after 30 min it stopped working again. I only use this for work. It doesn't get tossed around in a backpack or anything it just sits on my desk and is used 8 hrs a day 5 days a week and is plugged back in at the end of the work day and died in 2 months.,2021,05
"Originally liked the idea of not having to use batteries. Tried using this mouse for about a week. When finished using it, I forgot to plug it in. So the next time I tried to use it, the power was zapped. That pretty much defeats the purpose of having a cordless mouse. With no power, had to use it when plugged into my laptop. Sent it back and got a mouse that requires on battery.",2021,05
Works great,2021,05
"Very cheaply made. It was the biggest waste of my money. The piece that plugs into the USB port broke in a weeks time as I was taking it out of the port. It can be glued back together but it would have to be done with precision and carefulness not to get glue all over it. I dont know that its worth it. I guess this is one of those things that its just better off going with the brand you trust and paying that little bit extra for something you know is not going to come apart because it was poorly constructed.It was pretty cool how it lights up. It is very lightweight as well, which I will leave that to your own interpretation.",2021,05
I use it plugged in as the battery life is ok but not amazing... but does what it’s supposed to do.. great addition to my workspace and very comfortable on the hand,2021,05
I like the fact that it's micro USB instead of swapping AAA battery and it's very light weight and soft and easy to use,2021,05
Very satisfying to use and look at but after a couple months the scroll wheel started being super rough and squeaky. Good value though.,2021,05
Very happy and true to its description.,2021,05
WORTH OF PURCHASE !!!,2021,05
Great product and very happy with my purchase. Quiet buttons when pressed and love the different color lights.,2021,05
"Product worked great for 1st 3 months, now the USB charging port is bad and since it's a rechargable mouse it's useless now. Led lights were cool and the mouse felt great ergonomically with soft quiet clicks. Being optical vs laser, it isn't for gaming and battery wouldn't last all day clicking. It also went into sleep mode too quickly and having to click without knowing where the arrow to turn it on turned into a hassle.",2021,05
"easy to use, lightweight and comfortable to the hand...",2021,05
Easy to use with a sleek design.,2021,05
It’s been about 5 months since I bought this. The piece that goes into your laptop to make it wireless completely fell apart and mouse no longer clicks. 10/10 would NOT recommend,2021,05
"Extremely comfortable, works great, looks gorgeous, and is rechargeable. Charges quickly and easily and the battery lasts a long time.",2021,05
The mouse is very cute and i love the colors and the way it lights up. I went to use it one day and it was out of charge (I charged it). I doubt this will last long. It was $15 but really worth about  $5.,2021,05
"Battery last forever!  I accidently left it on over the weekend and still didn't need to charge it until Tuesday.  it did take some getting used to the power save function, you need to click to wake it up.",2021,05
Satisfied,2021,05
I only had it for a week and it quit charging I even tried other charging ports it would not take a charge waste of my money,2021,05
This mouse was awful!! It worked for a few minutes and then stopped working. You’d have to turn it off and back on again for it to work for a minute. I changed the battery twice. Do not purchase.,2021,05
"I loved this product but, when I went to remove it from the usb slot, the inner part broke off inside the computer.",2021,05
"I have already ordered the black one and liked it so much, I orderer another one for my laptop!",2021,05
"The device looks and feels good.  The left clicker is very sensitive and mandates that under normal use you keep your hand off of the top of the mouse on the left side or you will accidently left click.  The coloring is good looking, but it is difficult to determine when you need to recharge.  the short charging cord connects to the computer, so you must leave the computer on while recharging the mouse, which is inconvenient.  but the control of the curser is good, although occasionally it seems to ""jump"" to a different place on the screen...still not sure why that happens.  But it is decent value for the money once you teach yourself it's ""quirks.""",2021,05
As described,2021,05
I read a lot of the reviews before I decide to buy this item.  So far I have no regrets. People complain about the mouse turning off and the lights being on.  So when I got the mouse noticed that there was an off button for the lights. If you think about it you are saving power when your not using it.  I would recommend the product.,2021,05
I got 4 of these and so far 2 have been returned. They work until they need charged and then they stop working.  Don't waste your money!,2021,05
good mouse,2021,05
No complaint!,2021,05
Actually changed my mind on this mouse. The one I was using was driving me crazy because the clicking was so loud. I broke this one out of the box and it's pretty cool. It changes colors and it's silent. I can work with the size being slimer.,2021,05
The cord going into for charging doesn’t fit exactly right. Seems cheaply made. Wouldn’t buy this brand again.,2021,05
Broke within a week. It’s cute and all but not worth it.,2021,05
"Perfect mouse, silently working",2021,05
Cable quit charging mouse after one charge!,2021,05
It charged up the first time and didn’t charge up again after that. And the replacement batteries for it cost more than the mouse itself. Very cool looking tho.,2021,05
I've had this mouse for almost 2 weeks now and and loved it until just yesterday the scroll wheel developed a loud grinding a popping sound every time you use it. I will definitely be sending this junk back and get something else.,2021,05
"This is the first mouse I have bought for my new PC, probably the best purchase I have made for my PC. It's great to use anywhere, it's so quiet and smooth looking, It fits in the palm of my hand nicely, the colors are a bit off but great for how cheap it was! I really like that It was cheap too, but it wasn't cheaply made or seemed like it. I 9/10 recommend! It was a bit trickcy to figure out how to connect it to my PC, I do have both USBC and USB on here but keep in mind that if you have a USB PC you will have to take out the connecter in the mouse, its hard to get it out of though! DO SAVE THE BOX FOR THE USBC CONNECTOR AND CHARGER!",2021,05
works well,2021,05
I like the compact shape and the changing light bar around it.,2021,05
I really love this mouse. I bought it for my office to get rid of the cords. The colors are nice and I like that it goes to sleep when not in use. I've gotten many compliments on it.,2021,05
Looks & feels great! Love all the colors!,2021,05
"I really like the feel and look of this mouse. I love the matte feel, and the lights. Its also very quiet and not clicky, I wasn't expecting that for the price!The only issue I have is that if you use it with a laptop and remove the receiver often, the receiver will come apart. Im not techy enough to figure out how to make it stay together (with glue??, idk) whenever I take it out, the USB drive and the black part separate, and its hard to take the drive out of my computer when that happens. Frustrating. Will say that it lasted a couple months before that happened though.. if you use it with a pc and never remove it,, itll last longer.. i just wish I could get a replacement receiver; I don't want to throw the mouse away if the receiver is the only issue with it. I got it in February 2021 and I noticed that it glitches a bit if its not on a mouse pad or about to die, which can be annoying but manageable;the mouse charges very quickly!",2021,05
"I really like this item, it is a lot better than the other ones I was using, great for gaming, charges quickly and easy to get started with and It fits my small hand perfectly. Would definitely recommend this product.",2021,05
"I absolutely love this mouse! Super handy dandy because not only does it work with my Mac it also works with my work laptop which is a dell. The only thing I don’t like about it is that if you don’t use it for a while, it shuts off. I mean it’s great because it saves energy so you don’t have to charge it often but meh. I’ve yet to charge it again. I used it for 2 days for at least 10 hours each day.",2021,05
Clicking the right and left stick and it's is slow to catch click. Cheap yes but as they say you get what you pay for. Cute yes.. but not worth the frustration.,2021,05
The mouse worked fine for the few minutes i got to use it. The USB charging cord was missing. Per the instructions you cannot use any other charging cord with it.,2021,05
"It's light and the texture is nice but there are a few flaws. The mouse can tilt forward lifting the back off the table since there's a lot of surface area past where it touches the surface of the table. The mouse is small, which is nice for portability, but for my hand size it gets uncomfortable after a while. The battery charge is good and the lights aren't too harsh. But by far the most annoying flaw is that it doesn't maintain a constant mouse button press. So if you have to hold and drag something, it will just randomly unclick even though you still have the button pressed. I tested this a lot and it always, without fail stops holding down on the computer. This is unplayable for some games where you have to hold down one of your mouse buttons. Perhaps I just received a faulty mouse, but for the price it's hard to complain too much.",2021,05
Absolutely amazing product! I cant get use it enough especially with the color light feature. The scroll bar is very smooth and the mouse itself fits perfectly in your hand. Not to mention there is no batteries required since it it rechargeable. Definitely worth a 5 star rating.,2021,05
👌 and on time,2021,05
THIS THING IS SO SMOOTH AND SO AWESOME! Highly recommend!,2021,05
"First the price is very affordable, it’s light weight and it works very well. The perfect part is it doesn’t make any sound. Love the product. I am very satisfied",2021,05
"This mouse is ergonomic, light weight, and very easy to use. Unfortunately the color shown in the picture for rose gold was not very accurate, it is much darker. I would still buy it again though.",2021,05
"I bought this for my daughter and initially she said she loved it.  Then, she stopped using it and went back to her old mouse.  I left my mouse at work and borrowed this one.  Now I know why she doesn’t use it.  It constantly disconnects and I have to turn it on and off to get it to work.  Then, it randomly tracks on the screen when I am not moving it...it seems like someone else is controlling my computer.  Unsettling.  This mouse is junk...very pretty junk.",2021,05
 This is so cute. I love how it changes colors. It is small but not too small.,2021,05
This was such a great buy. Way better than my microsoft mouse. I'm soooo happy I bought this. The light features are really nifty. I haven't really touched it but I'm just so impressed with now smooth it works on surfaces and on the computer. I'm in love,2021,05
Works good for a laptop,2021,05
Love how lightweight it is. Just a light tap to right and left click. Mouse tracks greats and the led lights are cute plus it’s pink and priced super! I brought this one for my work PC and I’m buying a second one for my MacBook ...  💕,2021,05
Perfect fit to my hand and matches my headphones!!,2021,05
"We bought this as a replacement for our son, for school work. He had the old version and it worked really well, but he dropped it one to many times and broke (lasted @ 1yr).  This one @a couple weeks into school work the cursor started to drift for no reason. My son is in the 5th grade, no drops, tried several differ backgrounds. Nothing worked, so my husband tried out the mouse, still does not work. Not upgraded, waisted our money and frustrated the whole house withe the uncontrollable drift.",2021,05
"Started out pretty nice but after 3.5 weeks the mouse no longer tracks properly. Even after charging all night, after about 3 minutes of use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements.Update: The vendor keeps sending me emails asking me to delete this review for $30- I'm guessing they don't want me to write this on the review but I've told them no three times now and they just sent another one.  I've told them that it's unethical. I've told them its completely against the spirit of reviews in the first place. And there's another one in my inbox. *sigh* I guess I just forward another one to the Customer Service Department of AMazon.",2021,05
It is just ok product for me. It could be more finished product but its not. Sometime it seems like its not clicking at all. Lights are good but for performance i give it three stars.,2021,05
"Very good, come back if need to",2021,05
This mouse is amazing its super quiet when clicking and it runs smooth even on bed sheets. It works on any surface!,2021,05
Perfect low profile for me. Not sure how long the charge will last with the LED's on but you can switch them off.For the price nothing to complain about. Thanks,2021,05
Charged this for 2 hrs like instructed and could not get the mouse to work. Extremely disappointed and returning.,2021,05
The sleekness of it and the colors. Loved it for work.,2021,05
It only lasted  3 days. Is not worth returning it.,2021,05
Very nice Mouse. Well designed and nice colors. Functioning well.I am satisfied with it.,2021,05
I am pleasantly pleased with this mouse. It’s attractive looking and works very well. It comes with a USB C adapter along with the charging cable in case you need one. Plug and play actually worked. No complaints about this mouse and would purchase again if I need an additional one.,2021,05
This mouse works well for my needs and fits in my (medium-sized) hands well. This is the first mouse I've ever owned with a built-in rechargeable battery and now I don't ever want to own one without it. The small form factor is also nice for packing up and taking on the go. Another nicely designed element is that the nano-receiver tucks into the bottom of the mouse and doesn't require prying off a cover or any extra effort to remove or insert.,2021,05
"This is the best wireless mouse I've ever used.  The flat profile keeps my arthritic hand from getting stiff and sore after long use.  The colors are subtle enough to be fun but not intrusive.  If you plan to use it with a desktop computer, be aware that the charging cord is very short, so using the mouse while charging may be a problem.  I use it with a laptop, where this is not an obstacle.  The mouse appears very well made and sturdy.",2021,05
"Works good for a child, not  for people with arthritis",2021,05
"I love this color-changing wireless mouse!! I’m a colorful person, so I recognize colors before recognizing plain black and white. As an educator, my office is colorful, and my classroom was colorful too!! LOVE IT!!!!",2021,05
I love this mouse. It’s VERY smooth. If I had one complaint it would be that it will be dead in the morning if you don’t plug it up before you leave work. But sometimes I just forget to plug it up when I leave so that’s my fault.,2021,05
Good mouse. Started has a silent click. But has gotten louder. It works great other than that.,2021,05
I an very unhappy with this products.  Uses less than a year the wire on usb adapter is broke and the mouse no longer work  Not happy at all  Can I send back so you can look at it?,2021,05
Stopped working after a couple of weeks.,2021,05
Works perfect. Connects easy. Long rechargeable battery,2021,05
"I have been using this mouse for about a month, it had been working perfectly. I only use it occassionally throughout the day. After about a month it stopped working while it was on the color changing mode. It still works while on the regular red light mode, but now not the color changing mode.",2021,05
"Bought for my 6th grader to use in school with her laptop on a daily basis.  She’s used this for quite sometime now with no issues, and she’s very rough on her things.",2021,05
Great product!! Would highly recommend!,2021,05
"I gave it two stars because I like glowing lights (can you tell I’m a child of the 80s?); if I could give it zero stars for function, I would. This mouse has a lot of good reviews - maybe mine is a fluke. It is, however, fairly horrible. The charge on the battery is extraordinarily short-lived and when charged, it sort of sucks then too.",2021,05
"Really disappointed with this product. I loved it when I got it. It fit my hand nicely worked like a dream, then it came time to charge it. No matter where I plugged it in I could not get it to charge. Not sure if it is just a faulty product or if this is just how they are.",2021,05
"mouse is tiny in my hand, scroll wheel broke within the first week, USB plug is terrible..the worst ive ever had to deal with. Upon trying to remove the wireless USB plug from any any the top half come out but the metal part stays stuck in the plug, this has happened repeatedlyI just bought a different mouse",2021,05
Love it for my work from home job very ergonomic and smooth.,2021,05
The charging cord was very flimsy and won’t charge any more. Lasted about a week.,2021,05
Ergonomic and nice,2021,05
"It's an ultra slim design, power saving and easy to use. Ergonomic design, high precision and silent click.",2021,05
"The reliable range is less than 18 inches.  At 4 feet, you usually have  to click repeatedly.  Control of the moving arrow was sporadic.  I thought something was wrong with my computer until I bought a new mouse, which works fine.",2021,05
"Its nice not having to buy batteries all the time for my mouse. Only downside is when I don't move the mouse for a while, you have to click the button to wake it up, sometimes it clicks on the screen and clicks on something I didn't want to click on or open.Update: it died 3 months later. Not worth it.",2021,05
The mouse lasted one day. I changed the battery. It still wont turn on. URRGGGG!,2021,05
"Mouse is pretty solid all around. Except..About a day after I started using it the wheel started squeaking, figure it might go away in time. Nope.. 2 months later still squeaking and getting more irritating by the day. Working in an quiet office it is loud enough that other people can hear it.",2021,05
"This mouse was great when it's working. I work from home and use my mouse frequently. I have to charge it once a day. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be normal, but my last wireless mouse did not need this much charging.",2021,05
"Silent clicks, works great. Takes getting used to lower profile.Not having to worry about battery is golden.",2021,05
"Looks cool, doesn't last.",2021,05
"This mouse is a perfect companion for my Microsoft SurfacePro 6. I use this mouse for casual browsing as well as digital artwork and photo editing. The mouse feels nice and works well, especially for the price. I also love the option to have the RGB color mode on or off during use. Perfect little mouse for everyday use!",2021,05
Battery life is so short it might as well be a wired mouse.  It charges with as USB cable. Dropped once and had to be glued back together.,2021,05
"Like: design, look, feel, soft touch/silent 'click', sleep feature (single click to wake it up)Dislike: it loses the charge a bit quicker than I'd prefer but works wellEdited from original review --  would recommend",2021,05
I love the fact that there are no batteries.  Just charge and go.,2021,05
Prettiest mouse I've ever had.,2021,05
"I have had this mouse for two weeks.  For the first few days it worked great.  Nothing has changed with my work setup, fresh batteries, clean underside with mouse pad and it continues to lag.  Disappointed in the product.",2021,05
"I was naive and thought ""wireless"" meant ""bluetooth"", but it doesn't. Make sure you read everything carefully! The colours change really smoothly, though.",2021,05
Easy to use. I have a mouse pad and moves pretty good over it and perfect fit in my hands. The quality of the product is good. The size is good fit to carry in hand or with laptop bag.,2021,05
"This mouse is just right to fit my hand. Light weight , w/ pretty lights !",2021,05
"I love my new mouse! Really like the low profile and the colorful lights. It was totally plug and play, with no problem. Very pleased with my purchase.",2021,05
Great product. We use it mostly on our fire tablet and it works great!Only complaint is that there is not built in storage for the usb-c adapter.,2021,05
"I like this mouse, works very good, the dpi button do it work. Is very silent, and you can turn off the color light. Very recommended.",2021,05
I had a wireless mouse for over a year and found the it was very unstable and track even when not being moved. This one is solid as a rock.,2021,05
"I fully charged the mouse, used once and then it quit working. It will still light up but no mouse on the screen.",2021,05
"Will not charge/hold a charge, so doesn't work upon arrival. Don't waste your money, spend the extra and get something that functions.",2021,05
Only 2 months old and already won't charge  Pretty but not very long lasting,2021,05
I only used this month a handful of times...and after one month the roller on the mouse stopped working...and go figure...the seller only allows returns within the first month...attractive mouse but doesn't work long term...,2021,05
"8/30/2021- Wanted to update my review. Not only did this not last AT ALL I have received MULTIPLE emails from the distributor asking to remove my review, promising an amazon gift card. They gave multiple excuses of why the item doesn't work. Clearly from all the recent reviews of this item, they have not fixed any of it. I get almost daily emails from them asking to remove my review. DO NOT buy this item, you will regret it!I was loving this mouse. Sleek design. Loved the rechargeable feature of it. Until one day I came into work, booted up my laptop and the mouse was no longer connecting to the computer. Tried to take out the USB of the computer, and part of it was left stuck in the computer. I am now going to have to try to get the piece out of the usb port on my laptop. And how about that, my return window ended last week. VERY frustrated and annoyed by this. I would not recommend this item.",2021,05
The mouse does well. I use it daily for work. It lasts a long time between charges and puts itself to sleep when I am not using it so battery is not wasted. Sometimes I can go 2 weeks without charging. My only complaint is the wheel. I have had it about 4 months and the wheel started squeaking recently. People can hear it in my calls and it sometimes drives me nuts. This is my 3rd wireless mouse (the other 2 were different kinds and the wheel stopped working at all- was a common complaint on those).,2021,05
I really liked it for gaming,2021,05
I bought this for my laptop for school work and it exceeded my expectations!!! The colors are amazing and not too distracting. So easy to connect and use. It’s also silent. I love it!,2021,04
I love this mouse. I got the teal and i used it for the first time today. I’m in love!,2021,03
"Love the slimline appearance and the changing colors. The colors add a sense of fun to a normally mundane piece of computer equipment. Also love the ability to keep it one color (red) or allow it to change colors and the ability to change the speed of the cursor. Good product, well designed. Make sure you are aware of the button on the bottom as it is not just an on/off switch, but has three positions. THIS IS NOW OCTOBER 2021, This mouse broke after little use while traveling. The scroll wheel broke inside the mouse making it useless. This appears to be a poor design and a weak point in this item and I would now not recommend it. I have had other computer mice for years without this issue.",2021,05
This product works great!!,2021,05
You can’t turn off the colors!!! It lights up the entire time you’re using it. I bought the white mouse of this brand and I love that one,2021,05
"There really isn’t anything to dislike about this mouse. The setup process is virtually non- existent, you just plug in the usb and you’re good to go. I have been using it for more than a week and I haven’t had to charge it yet. The light display is a neat added bonus, great for dark room adventures 😎. Long story short, it does what I expected, but better. Great buy.",2021,05
"So cute, great night light, long battery, no issues. Loveeeee it 😍Oh and it also pauses by itself when not in use which is cool",2021,05
Quiet click. Holds charge forever. Colors are a nice touch,2021,05
Not even a month and it’s broken,2021,05
"Beautiful lights, Quiet  and works well",2021,05
Tru,2021,05
I am just past the return window and of course this doesn’t work anymore.  I have barely used and haven’t had that long,2021,05
loved it. I love the colors.,2021,05
"I love this mouse it works well with my laptop. It changes colors with music, I wasn't expecting that but it is a bonus! It also changes color with the speakers I purchased, I defiantly would recommend this product.",2021,05
Love that this is so colorful. Works great with my mac,2021,05
"I’ve had this mouse for less than a month, and now it won’t work. I loved this mouse at the beginning. Never had a problem with it, and it was super cute. Now, it turns on and everything, and is also fully charged FYI, and it won’t move at all on my laptop. Just when I need it for a huge work project, and I can’t use it. Bummer.",2021,05
I love this mouse! Works and looks great for the price. Very comfortable and smooth operation. The charging cable that came with it didn't work though but I had another one so no biggie.,2021,05
"I’ve had this device for about 6 months. I brought 2 for my kids’ distance learning. No issues so far, I charge the device at least once a week",2021,05
Came with a big gash in it.,2021,05
Just got it today and started using it a few hours ago. So far so good I like it.,2021,05
Works great,2021,05
While the mouse was ok at the beginning it is now lagging after about 2 months of use. I've had to order a new mouse already to replace this one.,2021,05
Worked as soon as it was being used,2021,05
"I really was disappointed in this product, just needed an extra mouse for work andnit only worked for a few hours before the problems started.It wouldn't track where the mouse was and the lights worked but the mouse was useless other than the light show.Save your time and choose a mouse from a more reputable company",2021,05
"I actually loved the mouse my only issue was that the charger came and the USB part was a little off and would not fit. But other than that I love the mouse, it works great and easy to use!",2021,04
Outstanding customer service. Had a question and received an immediate response and resolution.. I love this mouse and would recommend it to others.,2021,04
"This is the first day of use, but the mouse looks nice, I got flat black, I like that there are no batteries. Charged quickly and super easy to start using. Its light and fits my small hand nicely. The lights are nice as well and not annoying. I like that they can be turned off. I don't plan on using the mouse for gaming so I will not know how well it works for that sort of thing.. for me just basic computer work, Photoshop & Lightroom and I think it will do nicely for those.. it seems quick and is working well even without a mouse pad. I think it was for sure worth the price so far. Its a nice basic mouse I think.",2021,04
This mouse is very quiet like it says in the description. Pretty. The only thing I worry about is it is very lightweight. The quality seems cheap. But it hasn’t proved that yet. I will only use it for office work so hopefully it will not wear out or go defective.,2021,04
Works right out of the box has the charging cable and both USB options so you can use it on different comps older and new. The lights are really cool too :),2021,04
Its really light weight and you don't hear the mouse clicks. However the usb blutooth is located at the bottom of the mouse.  I didn't have tough enough finger nails to pull the usb out.  Logitech has their blutooth in the mouse where the battery is located but this didn't have a visible battery.  So I used the tip of a knife to pop the usb out.  Almost nicked my hand from the blade getting the usb out.  You may do a better job than me.,2021,04
"This mouse is great! It feels good in your handle, glides well, easy to use and looks amazing while doing it. It makes work a little less boring and looks so sleek on my desk.",2021,04
Super comfortable to use!!,2021,03
"There's really nothing to dislike about it, I love the fact that I don't have to run out and buy batteries every time it starts to act like it's not going to work. The way it charges is one of the main reasons that I bought it. I'd rather save the $$ for batteries and get something else instead of worrying if I have enough spare batteries. I have a mouse pad that has a ""breathing"" mode and the mouse goes along with its own pattern to make the two of them an excellent night light of sorts. For the amount spent, I'd give this mouse a 10+. I also love the fact that it's easy to pack it up with my laptop and go anywhere without worrying (again) if my mouse will run out of power. I think that there should be more accessories that can charge from a USB port rather than lugging around extra batteries.",2021,04
Great item kids love it,2021,04
It works nicely.,2021,04
Looks cool,2021,04
"This mouse is cute and convenient. Not heavy, the shiny black color looks nice against the colors and it is quiet. Works fine with my macbook air. The only thing is that the usb adaptor it comes with, is very hard to insert it into the c port that it comes. But besides that, everything works fine.",2021,04
"Used mouse for less than a week. It will not hold charge. Used for less than 2 hours this morning after charging for 24 hours and it’s now dead. But when it worked I loved it! It was light, quiet, and very colorful.",2021,04
"This is an awesome mouse!  It is a slender build so it fits a small hand & the lights are totally fun.  When you click the buttons, it is a strong click so that you know you have clicked on something, it, also, has a quick response on the computer.  It has an off & on switch plus an automatic shut off so you won't use up the batteries.  I will be buying one for my daughter, it is awesome.",2021,04
"I find this mouse easy to use, fits my hand very well (wear a medium sized glove) and moves fairly smoothly.  I say fairly smooth because I used a mouse pad with a smooth soft surface.  It seemed to drag just a little. When I tried a smooth hard surface it worked better.  You do have to click a button to ""wake up"" the mouse when it goes to sleep mode.  My other one woke up with just moving it.  I thought that maybe the changing lights around the mouse would be distracting but I dont even notice it.  I would probably buy again.",2021,04
My hand doesn't cramp using it. WIN!Update: Wheel in mouse won't scroll. Sadness,2021,04
Broke within a week,2021,04
I wanted it without the dongle,2021,04
"The mouse functions well, I especially like the colorful lights, however, the battery is kind of a pain. It lasts for only 1.5 days, even when it is in sleep mode. I have to remember to charge it everyday, which unfortunately I am not good at. I ended up using my old mouse as a backup every a few days.",2021,04
"Really disappointed. I wanted to love this product, but the USB-C adapter that came with it doesn’t fit into my USB-C port. It looks like it only goes half way in. So basically the product is useless :(The mouse itself was pretty and easy to manipulate. Wish the adapter worked",2021,04
My home schooling student enjoyed the lights but it has stopped working entirely after 4 months. Too late to return. So fun for awhile but don't expect it to last.,2021,04
"I love this mouse so much I bought another one. I love the soft click, that it is rechargeable, and the lights are great. Easy to install, just stick the USB dongle into the computer and Starr using. Probably the best mouse I’ve had.",2021,04
"Item must’ve been defective or something because in 2 was it stopped working, charging and pretty much would o my work at will.Also the returns process with this vendor sucks. It’s not via Amazon. Had to go twice to UPS because I had to print the label or pay $3.50 to print on site. Then had to also buy an envelope to ship it back in.If I would’ve paid a little bit more for a higher quality, would thane had to waste more time and money with the hassle. Save yourself the grief and get one a little bit more upscale.",2021,04
Didn't work.,2021,04
This is a great mouse especially for the price! It's quickly responsive even after sleep mode. Like the look of it too!,2021,04
Smooth clicking.  Ran out of battery quickly so shut it off when not in use.,2021,04
"Comfortable and sleek, great for traveling.  Love the colors running around it!",2021,04
I bought this for my new laptop because I really don't like the finger pads on laptops.It is truly plug-and-play and works awesome! plus it looks really sleek.,2021,04
Nice colorful LED mouse that is still tethered to a cord when in use for a while,2021,04
The wheel/roller makes click vibrations and makes scrolling take longer. I would love it otherwise.,2021,04
Stopped working a day and a half after I got it. I’ve charged it and everything and it just won’t work. Good for the couple of hours that I did use it I thought the lights were pretty. So I give it two stars for having pretty lights but no other stars because it was a waste of my money since it no longer works.,2021,04
Greatest,2021,04
Love the quietness and how light it is,2021,04
Won’t stay charged!,2021,04
Really like this mouse (never thought I’d say that..)It stores the USB port in its belly when you need to disconnect which is super helpful for someone who loses small pieces. It’s a quiet click which I appreciate even when working alone. And the rainbow lighting is optional.Win win win.It’s light too as it’s rechargeable! I carry it with my laptop and it’s made working on the go better,2021,04
"It's a pretty mouse! Just some notes.-Plastic a bit thin at the top so the color bleeds through more than the pic. It's fine, just an aesthetic thing.- mouse wheel a bit noisy now after some use. squeeks and screetches some when scrolling.-battery life is fine. .glad i can use it when charging .- sensitivity is off. cursor moves quickly randomly as if its spazzing out. thought this was a battery issue but it happens when fully charged sometimes.Overall it's fine but I shouldve just bought something a bit sturdier even if it was pricier. gonna keep using it to get my moneys worth!",2021,04
The mouse is so fast and good!  Got the silver color and its so pretty especially at night. Easy set up,2021,04
I got this for my sister for her birthday to go with her new laptop and she absolutely loves it. Very easy to use and adorable,2021,04
"I love this, no more batteries, and I love how it lights up...",2021,04
This mouse is garbage. Buyer beware. Doesn't hold a charge. Doesn't move the cursor. Bought 2 for 2 separate computers and its the same for both. Amazon basics mouse is 1000% better,2021,04
Lightweight. Easy bluetooth connection. The glow adds an extra pizzazz.😄,2021,04
"Worked great for about 1 week. Now won't work. Love the color and that it was a ""quiet click"" but disappointed that it died.",2021,04
Product did not move smoothly across the mouse pad and did not fit my hand particularly well.,2021,04
....not so great with the rendering. Dragging objects with the mouse is not so great. Especially acrosss screens. I work on visio a lot and its just very hard to get this to drag stuff around. So basically has a bad sensor. But its smooth and very quiet.,2021,04
I absolutely love my mouse. It's good quality and last a pretty long time before needing a charge.,2021,04
"Not bad, rechargeable and portable. Highly recommend",2021,04
Don’t buy this! You have to charge it every day. You might as well have a mouse with a cord because that’s what it ends up being. It does not take a battery and Hass to be charged all the time.,2021,04
"Battery lasts forever, smooth and sleek design. If you use the middle mouse button, it's a little hard to click, but that's literally the only downside. Would recommend this mouse to anyone else looking for an affordable sleek mouse.",2021,04
Nice and soft but the laser isn’t very accurate,2021,04
"The mouse worked immediately but stopped responding after 2 minutes. No troubleshooting worked, laptop recognized the dongle the whole time, but couldn't move the cursor or click. Tried on an additional computer and still no luck.",2021,04
It is really quite except that the scroll button when you click it is really loud. RGB is decent for the price but I wish it was brighter. Overall its decent,2021,04
Love this mouse. Love that I don't need to use batteries anymore. It's comfortable to use as well,2021,04
Didn’t work piece of crap,2021,04
Nice looking mouse,2021,04
Easy to set up / connect....happy with this product,2021,04
I wanted silent or soft clicks and that's what I got. The led light were a bonus for me.,2021,04
The mouse will not charge. And it feels cheaply made.,2021,04
Broken right after ran out of return window came . The narrow keep moving and linking event when is using or not using it. Don’t know what problem with it.,2021,04
"This mouse does what it needs for the most part. However, the cursor itself will jump all over the page from time to time which is annoying.",2021,04
"The one I'm currently using has been dropped a number of times, & is currently wrapped with scotch tape.  I wanted new one in the  event the older one gives up & quits on me.  And with this newer, sleeker one it has a splace for the USB connector to be stored (for travel purposes), on the underside of the mouse.  Another great feature, I think!",2021,04
"I love this mouse! I actually purchased two because of the look, but they are great! I use one at my home office and one at my office.",2021,04
"This mouse is rechargeable, which is great, except that it doesn't hold a charge. I charged it all night and the next day, it died after using it for 5 minutes. I would not recommend this item and will go back to a wireless mouse that uses batteries.",2021,04
The battery life on this mouse is terrible.  It lasts maybe a day to a day and a half without recharging. Also a bit small and the grip is slippery.  I would not recommend it to anyone.,2021,04
"I love the mouse, but sometimes it randomly stops working and my computer won’t recognize it. I noticed it did this when I used the changing color settings. I recommend just keeping it on “on” and not the changing colors setting.",2021,04
"Great product. Works as advertised, light and cool colors!!",2021,04
It quit working after 2 weeks,2021,04
It stopped working after jus 3 days. It Sucks period!!!,2021,04
"It is okay. The scroll wheel and clicker are quiet, but the mouse emits a super high frequency noise any time it moves. I have become aware of it and can't stand using it much anymore.",2021,04
The mouse stopped working after about a month of use.,2021,04
This is the best mouse and I love that it is rechargeable. I haven't had a lag problem unlike a mouse that requires batteries. I loved it so much I bought another ❤,2021,04
The item is supposed to wake up after turning itself off in order to save battery but mine never did. I had to turn it off and then on again.And then after 3 days the cursor began moving wildly by itself and then later that day the buttons stopped working entirely.,2021,04
"Finally! The wireless, rechargeable mouse works as advertised. Small, handy, recharging is easy.",2021,04
Nice Mouse but I have had other rechargeable and this one seriously lacks uptime. I'm getting about a few days and dies quickly. My first one would last weeks but I lost it at a conference.... I should have went back to it...,2021,04
"It worked for 5min and then got stuck in my laptop, looks like made of cheap material",2021,04
This product is useless and the quality is abysmal! I have never complained about any product I purchased from Amazon (or through Amazon) in the last 20 years as a customer. Please inform all your customers that this product is a cheap quality piece of damnation!,2021,04
"Worked great for less than a month. Received in April 4 and broke today, May 2. No clue what happened. I went to use it after taking a break for a few hours and it just fell apart and I'm not able to put it back together.",2021,04
I wasn't sure what to expect with this mouse but it works perfectly. I never thought I'd be so excited to use a wireless mouse.,2021,04
It works okay but is hard to charge.,2021,04
The metal piece that is attached to the chip on the ubs broke off in my side brand new laptop... talking about being sick,2021,04
"Honestly feels a bit on the cheap side, and compared to other similar makes, the main difference being LED lighting so it adds a 'wow' factor to it. Clicking is also smooth and feels nice, and the top-down view is pleasing. The lighting itself is mostly smooth but blotchy at some points where the color is abrupt rather than a seamless transition.Performance wise it does the job, but ergonomically doesn't feel as form-fitting as a gaming mouse. I'd really use this as a backup work mouse or a home mouse where its just to surf the web. Also the cursor sometimes randomly jumps. First time this has happened on a mouse, so it seems like they really cut costs and marked up the price.If I were to guess the price if I'd seen the product without a price tag, I'd probably say its about 6-7 bucks.",2021,04
This was a horrible purchase. I am returning this because it sucked.,2021,04
"Developers really did-a-number with this device! This mouse speaks for itself. It is actually just what the marketing team indicated, AWESOME! I am a customizable type of consumer, thus I enjoy my share of intriguing components that of which deviates from the mundane norm. This led mouse Wowed-Me with the illuminating colorful lighting and the smoothness upon usage. Very well crafted and I look forward to purchasing other colors as time progress.",2021,04
"This is a great mouse. Quiet, responsive, fun color!",2021,04
"The main thing for me is that it is really pretty. Maybe that's just a girl reason to like it but I am a girl. And an artist. And maybe a wee bit eccentric. I want stuff around me to add to my environment, especially now. Other than that, well, its a mouse. It does all the same things other computer mice do and it does it well. And its pretty!",2021,04
"It’s cool, feels pretty smooth and nice light colors but the battery doesn’t last long.",2021,04
"The USB plug broke and the case around the chip got stuck inside the port. I can pull the USB out but the case stays inside the port. It's still useable if I put it back in though. It also has a very high pitched dog whistle kind of noise when it moves, especially when it's used close to the USB plug. It is not silent... that's for sure. I have to use music or headphones when I use this mouse or it drives me insane.It's shallow depth is kind of hard on my hand, but I have arthritis so I usually need a thicker/taller mouse to fill my palm to be comfortable. But I bought this mouse as a backup for my work laptop, so I don't use it as much as I use my gaming mouse.I like that you can still use it when it's plugged in to charge if you use a longer cable.",2021,04
Love my pretty mouse!  It’s cooler than anyone else’s mouse!!!,2021,04
This is a great mouse. Easy to use runs very smoothly and the color matched my keyboard perfectly. I would recommend this product to anybody.,2021,04
Battery last. Great for kid to use.,2021,04
Pretty good mouse for when I do school work,2021,04
The slim design feels amazing. The price is perfect and the lights on it just make it fun.  Worth it!,2021,04
This is a fun mouse! Love the gold and the light show it provides. Most importantly it works so well and makes me work at light speed!,2021,04
Love it. Slim line and fits in laptop bag much nicer than my old one and it's pretty!,2021,04
This is a good product.  It fits well in my hand and I love that it is rechargeable.  I would buy this mouse again.  I don't use it for gaming since that is something I don't do.  It serves my purpose well.,2021,04
Got this for my daughter and she loves it. It is rechargeable and lights up. She loves that it is so quiet when she is using it to play a game.,2021,04
"I knew it was too good to be true, this would be a great mouse but it just stopped working after a week. I have charged it a few times prior, no issues. I went to use it today and nothing. I would avoid and spend a few more bucks on something not as cheaply made.",2021,04
"This mouse arrived yesterday. I plugged it in for 2 hours, per the instructions, and then started to use it. It worked GREAT!Once I got off work, I turned it off and went about my merry way. When I returned and had to check on something, I tried to use it again and it is completely non-responsive. I've tried different USB ports, unplugging and replugging the dongle, and I even charged it overnight to ensure that it had a full charge.It does not work. I was so excited for this mouse. It's slim and quiet, which are both great qualities with the amount of travel that I do while still getting some work done on my vacations... but it's not worth the money. Less than 24 hours later and I'm back to having to use my trackpad because this mouse decided it wasn't going to work any longer.",2021,04
Will be returning middle track roller does not work. If the mouse sits idle for to long it loses wireless connection  with the computer and  you have to shut it off and turn it back on. The led color changer is cool other than that it's just ok.,2021,04
Didn’t buy this for gaming but it’s a smooth mouse which I love. I work from home and utilize this while on my work and home lap tops.,2021,04
Love it very ergonomic,2021,04
The coolest mouse ever! It charges quickly and lasts a long time. I love the color changes and the smoothness it scrolls with.,2021,04
"I really like that it comes with a USB-C adapter. Saved my life because the new MacBooks aren't compatible with USB. Over all a really nice mouse, fits in my hand perfectly and I love the lights on it.",2021,04
Cute,2021,04
I love this mouse and the color mold is nice. Works well as WiFi mouse.,2021,04
"Mine did not hold a charge very long.A day at the most, if I don't use it for work.When I used it for work, I needed to plug it in half through my workday. So I use it only on my private computer couple hours a day.",2021,04
I really like my new LED Wireless mouse. It is easy to hold and it's really to look at. The LED lights change colors and it works great as a mouse. It adds some fun to your normal day. I love it!!,2021,04
"I really love my mouse, I have no issues at all. I'm thinking about ordering my sister one, she saw mines and instantly fell in love with it. Order you one, you won't regret it.",2021,04
This has been a great mouse thus far. I love the sleep mode and does not have a large arch for your hand. Very much recommend.,2021,04
The mouse stopped working after one week. I got no response from their customer service.,2021,04
"Really nice mouse, smooth, responsive & the clicks are pretty noiseless. This is my first wireless RGB mouse I get, so far I'm not disappointed. You can also use it while connected to the charging cable.",2021,04
Didn’t work-sending back,2021,04
"I like the look and feel of this mouse,  however the fact that you have to charge it is kind of a pain. It doesn't make it through a full work day so usually by the end of thebday I have to plug in my wired mouse.",2021,04
This mouse was a certifiable piece of crap. Worked until the initial charge was drained and never again. DO NOT BUY THIS HUNK OF JUNK.,2021,04
Wife loves it She uses it daily with no issues. LED is nice and bright!  Would be nice to add a larger capacity battery.,2021,04
"Grabbed this for my laptop so I don't have to mess with the trackpad for work. After 2 days of use, it no longer holds a charge. Not the fault of the charge port, as I switched it to a different one to be sure. The price is too good to be true!",2021,04
Like it,2021,04
This product stop working after 1 month,2021,04
"I loved this , but I’ve only had it two months and it stopped working .",2021,04
"Easy to use, great on the hand. Good product!",2021,04
"This mouse feels very sleek to the hand. However, the battery only lasts about 3 hours and takes about an hour to charge fully. The LED lights are not very bright; even when I turn the feature off the mouse still dies in about three hours.",2021,04
"Love this mouse!Mouse came days before delivery ETA which was always nice. Love that it's rechargeable. No more dead batteries mid work shift! Mouse connected right away to my ThinkPad. I ordered the white and the illuminating changing colors look awesome! Mouse is low profile with a really nice feel to it. I tend to run through computer mice pretty quick so only time will tell for Longevity. So far it's a 10/10 for me.Do note with the white version the colors bleed through the top as you can see in the picture and video however still looks cool to me, just different than the advertised photos.",2021,04
Easy to use and love that it's rechargeable!,2021,04
"Was so excited for this mouse, loved the style and lights when I ordered it. Once I received it, I used it for approx half a day and then it died and never turned back on. I charged it through the pc for quite a while, when I realized it hadnt charged I tried a wall outlet. Never turned back on. I went through some of the reviews after and realized it was a running theme and that many other customers had the same experience. dont waste your time.",2021,04
I have only used it for a few months and it already broke when I dropped it on the floor. It's too fragile.,2021,04
Nice mouse,2021,04
Works well.,2021,04
The mouse had no issues working with my Windows 10 over all so nice and silence i lovet,2021,03
"Like others have reported, the mouse curser jumps around and blinks after a short (30 min) period of use making it difficult to control and sometimes nonresponsive. You have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision. I charged it over the weekend thinking the battery was not fully charged but the same results this morning. I have requested a refund and will be purchasing something that works.",2021,04
"This product worked only for the first time I have charged it and then could not hold any charge. I have kept it plugged for a whole day without success. Do not waste your money, get a decent product from a decent manufacturer.",2021,04
"I liked the ergonomics the most. Very easy to hold the mouse. My palm did not pain, inspite of heavy usage. It restarts quickly from sleep mode. Consumes less power. Perfect buy. Value for the money. Highly recommend.",2021,04
I love this mouse!,2021,04
"Very long range Bluetooth, super smooth for laptop gaming, totally recommended!!!",2021,04
Battery dies way too fast.,2021,04
"This is the cheapest, flimsy made in China item I’ve seen. Do not buy it. Never worked out of the box.",2021,04
"The mouse works well asked is comfortable to use, but the changing lights drain the battery very quickly.",2021,04
Doesn’t stay charged long and some functions don’t work.,2021,04
Haven’t had it year and I have barely used it and it’s already stopped working right. The mouse just goes all over the place on the screen and not where you try to put it.,2021,04
So light and love it being rechargeable,2021,04
"Decent if you like a simple mouse.  Cool lights, as well.",2021,04
Mouse is supposed to have a setting which allows it to change colors. The lights stay red on both settings. No color changing.,2021,04
I purchased  for work  and loved it until it got dropped from my desk.,2021,04
"Works okay. Kept going to sleep on me, even while just reading a webpage for too long, and I would have to turn it on and off again. Easy to navigate and I like the design, but it was a pain keeping it on.",2021,04
i love it and i hope you buy it i love it and i hope you love it too,2021,04
There were no instructions with the mouse.,2021,04
i really love the long battery life  of this mouse. i was wandering before buying this stuff. but once I got it I didn't wanted to go back to other mouse. i even suggested my friends to buy. and they are happy with the purchase,2021,04
"I had to get another mouse. This wouldn’t respond to clicks or scrolling about 50% of the time, even when I got the 3M mousepad that improves mouse functioning.",2021,04
There are two light modes. I like the color changing option.,2021,04
Works great. No complaints.,2021,04
" Very light,trendy , easy to connect and use . really love it",2021,04
"I got a brand new laptop everything is up to date , yet when i plug in the receiver It says it malfunctions. When looking at “devices” it says driver error. I uninstalled, re-installed , Reset my computer multiple times. Do not get this.",2021,04
"I love the colors that it shuffles through.  I also like that it is virtually sound proof.  No more hearing a click from across the room.  Only thing, I wish I could pick a stationary color, instead of that feature always being red.",2021,04
"Easy on the hand, looks great, recharge easy!",2021,04
It seems to be working just fine to me when it came. Also I like the glowing effect from the led lights,2021,04
I didn't need the lights and everything. It's pretty annoying as the mouse wanders quite a bit and won't always listen to where you're trying to go.,2021,04
My mouse is not working properly. I just purchased it not even a week ago. Sending it back,2021,04
"Very quiet, nice lighting",2021,04
"Great little mouse, light weight and I love the colorful lights and can turn off when not using to save charging power.",2021,04
I love the mouse but I’m having to charge it a lot more often than I expected.,2021,04
Reacts a little slow,2021,04
It's super quiet. I have it plugged in through a hub adapter to a Google Slate tablet and it worked immediately. No issues at all. Lights up and color changes which is just a cool add-on feature. No complaints here. Very portable.,2021,03
You spelt 'durable' wrong. So say goodbye to me and my money.,2021,03
"It’s really cute and small. It fits well in my hands and feels nice. It worked well for about  a week. After that, it started having a lag. I thought maybe it’s that I did not charge it well but I did.Idk if it’s a me problem or it’s the mouse but I haven’t been able to use it due to the lag.",2021,03
Cute and fun to watch while using,2021,03
I have small hands and this fits perfectly.  Very cute and lightweight,2021,03
 Sooo this thing is so cute for starters. It’s light weight and without my mouse pad it smooths across surfaces easily. The buttons aren’t hard and actually it’s easier to click on different things.Only negatives I have. When it goes into sleep mode I have to turn it on and off.And the second thing is a pro and con for me. The usb chip to make the mouse work wireless is stored under the mouse. I love it because it makes traveling with this mouse for work super easy. I just wish it had a latch release. I had to use a card to pop it out. Other than those 2 things it’s great! I didn’t even have to charge it when I took it out the box.,2021,03
"Terrible product, charge lasts only a couple of hours.",2021,03
"This mouse is so sensitive if The surface is not absolutely debris free or flat signal signal won’t be sent from the wireless mouse to the computer screen. I’ve had it for several weeks and have tried it with several mouse pads, surfaces, paper under the mouse, it’s just not a good fit.I like the changing light color, it’s very pretty, but for me not a great wireless mouse.",2021,03
It turns off when I’m using it sometimes,2021,03
Very chic and love the way it lights up. It has two settings either leave the lights totally on or have them cut on as you tap on the buttons. Works wonderful and I have only had to charge it one time since I've had the mouse.,2021,03
The first mouse did not work however I was sent a gift certificate for my trouble .  The other mouse (same model) works greatEasy to find because of the lights,2021,03
" Great mouse, the best for the price!!!",2021,03
"For the price its been great,  functionality is good. Light weight, can't go wrong!",2021,03
It didn’t sync with my laptop.,2021,03
"The mouse was stunning when I first got it, it was very fluent but the one problem and a VERY major problem for me was the fact that the mouse kept left clicking every time I right clicked and my chromebook didn't have a setting to fix it.  Overall it was just an annoying issue.",2021,03
"I like how easy it flow while using it, also how it lights up in different colors. Comfortable in my palm too.I would recommend",2021,03
I use this with my MacBook Pro and it works great! Very quiet and smooth.,2021,03
While re-chargeable the battery life is terrible.  Feels cheap and does not track well.  Tossed in in the rubbish and purchased and Amazon Basics mouse.  Less expensive and far more capable alternative.,2021,03
"I bought the gold. It's a soft brushed color and it's very quiet during use. The brightness of the color change is soft also. It fits comfortably in my palm, good purchase.",2021,03
"It looks good, feels good, but just works poorly. Did not track smoothly at all, and more times than not I’m trying to get the pointer to stop having a little seizure on the screen. Tried with and without a pad under it.",2021,03
Works great! Comfortable and smooth.,2021,03
I have had this mouse for about seven days and it is not track well if there’s a delay and it’s only broken the click button has already broken. My advice if you want something very sleek it’s a great sleek mouse but it’s not reliable. Don’t cheap out and get a better mouse.,2021,03
"This mouse is awesome. It charges quickly and comes with an adapter for the new Apple Mac plug thing. I hated my other Dell mouse and this one is so smooth, quick to react, and quiet! I never thought it would make a difference, but my students can not hear my annoying clicking anymore! 10/10 recommend.",2021,03
"It's so quiet and easy on my hands when making art on my laptop. This mouse has smooth cursor movement and is super easy to charge, no more batteries!",2021,03
"cool mouse, slim, and comfortable .",2021,03
Pretty cool devise. Easy to install. No instructions needed,2021,03
The mouse is very comfortable to use sturdy and fun with the LED light. Great Quality for the price,2021,03
"I love this mouse! The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because the scroll wheel is opposite. When I scroll forward (away from me) the page goes down and when I scroll backwards (towards me) the page goes up. I'm getting used to it, but I'd rather it just be like a normal mouse. Is there any way to fix this? Or does anyone else have this problem?",2021,03
 This mouse is lightweight.  It charges fast by a small cable which is included.  It does not take batteries. It puts on a light show of colors fun for adults or children.  This can easily be turned off by a switch on the bottom of the mouse.The mouse itself is easy to assemble.  There is a small usb plug that clips to the bottom of the mouse for storage when you are not using it.  This plugs into your computers usb port when you do use it.This is a great mouse to use as a backup.  The color is great also.Review title:  Great spare mouse,2021,03
"This is a very nice mouse for my needs. I like how it lights up, especially when I am using it in the dark, which makes it easier to use, and I appreciate that I do not have to buy batteries...worth the purchase.",2021,03
"For $11, this is the best wireless mouse I’ve ever used. Set it up in two minutes, feels good in my hand, the scrolling wheel is nice and the clicking is silent! I cannot stand loud clicking mice. I got this for my work computer and think I’m also going to get one for my laptop.",2021,03
"quit working, trashed it",2021,03
The mouse is super sleek and comfortable for people who like their hands more flat. Super pretty when all lit up and works perfectly! but you better not drop it or drop anything you're carrying it in because it instantly will stop working every 2 minutes you use it there after. I should have expected this from such a cheap mouse but after one minor drop is ridiculous.,2021,03
Bought this for my new laptop I bought and I love this mouse. the color changing amuses me so that is why I thought hmmm ok I will buy it and i'm so happy I did.,2021,03
Very easy setup! Nice and stylish. Great product for the price.,2021,03
"This is so pretty! Fits I'm my hand perfect, the lights are soooo pretty lol it was beyond easy to set up on my laptop. It came partially charged even. So I could use right out the box. Easy to charge. Lasts really long time too. Love it, would totally gift!!!",2021,03
This product is not worth the money. It stopped working all together after 2 and 1/2 months.,2021,03
"It changes color and that feature can be switched on and off. But that's it. It doesn't work at all as a mouse with my MacBook, even with using the included receivers.",2021,03
"Love this mouse for my laptop. Glad I chose this one. Not only is it comfortable, slim and sleek in my palm, but I love the rotating fun colors that it emits, which can also be turned off for the single-color mode.",2021,03
Really quite while in use and beautiful to look at.,2021,03
do not buy this! it doesnt connect or show up on my laptop to pair it. i dont suggest anyone buy this item,2021,03
"Purchased for my 9 year old daughter....she absolutely loves it! Sleek design, great for small desks and true to color. Highly recommend!!",2021,03
Great Product 100% recommended!,2021,03
"The mouse is contained in a Japanese package but was made in China. It comes with the type-c adapter, c-charging/usb cable, regular 2.0 USB mouse receiver, and thin instructions.I've plugged the Type C adapter into two different machines with the same result. Neither laptops read the type c directly or through another adapter. I've also tried another wireless mouse receiver in the type c with the same results. None of them work through this adapter.Other than that issue the mouse works. It also goes to sleep so by clicking the mouse one is able to use it again. The also other nice feature is that it is wireless with no battery included. Just plug in the charging cord into an empty USB slot.The color changing around the rim of the mouse gives a nice touch, and although at first the mouse feels 'long' due to it's sleek shape, it does fit comfortably in the hand. It also has a plastic-like feeling, and on the instructions it says to avoid dropping the mouse so it doesn't malfunction or break.",2021,03
Very sleek looking. As pictured. I love the color. Good product,2021,03
"Great, works good",2021,03
It’s a great ergonomic mouse for gaming.,2021,03
I use this mouse every day at my desk. It has a very long battery time limit and working amazingly. Highly recommend,2021,03
Well enough,2021,03
It matches my computer,2021,03
This mouse has been so much better on my wrists.  It’s sleek new design makes it easier to sit all day without the need to move to another position to relieve the strain on my wrist. I love the rechargeable aspect because I no longer need to struggle with the endless supply of battery replacements. It is so easy to sync up and was ready to go right away. So many colors to choose from too!,2021,03
"The rose gold color is very pretty, and the color changing effect was nice at first but after about an hour of use the colors started to glitch - the back end of the mouse was staying yellow and the front continued to change colors. There is an option to turn the colors off, but you end up with a red light that shows up randomly while moving the mouse around. It will get the job done but also feels very cheap compared to a Logitech or name brand. Get what you pay for in this case.",2021,03
 I Like the color. I thought it was going to have changing colored lights. It only close red which was disappointing. It’s also kind of flat and smaller than I expected. Overall I mean does what I need it to do.,2021,03
"i recently bought a new chromebook and wanted a wireless mouse to match, i came across this mouse and after reading the reviews figured id give it a try, i cant say how good it works yet because i never recieved the usb-c adaptor with it and for some reason cant get it to connect wireless im sure ill figure it out but it wouldve been nice to have the wire option as well. otherwise its slim which is what i wanted and i like the lights on it",2021,03
I love this mouse for the most part. The colors are vivid and it feels nice in my hand. The only downside is that the right click has a tendency to stick even when I am only using the left click. I've had it for a few days now and that's the only negative.,2021,03
This mouse is great for what I use it for I like the RGB effects not really designed for gaming,2021,03
"This mouse has a very poor sensor. It will take several seconds to wake up after being inactive for a bit, and you sometimes have to click the DPI button or mouse buttons several times and shake the mouse for it to wake up. The sensor also cannot move fast. If I try moving the mouse quickly, the cursor gets very spastic and starts curving around the screen like Deja Vu is playing in the background.Speaking of clicks, the left mouse button double clicks quite a bit.The only thing this mouse has going for it is its design. Even then, the design is uncomfortable since its so flat.Find a better mouse. Please. Don't torture yourself with this.",2021,03
 Works very well. I keep the led light shut off to save battery. I've had it for about a week and haven't needed to charge it yet. I shut it off when not in use. It's so nice not to have a cord to deal with. I want to buy another one I love it so much! The color is gorgeous 😍,2021,03
"After I connected this mouse, whole mechanism fXXXXX UP...",2021,03
"I like the mouse, it operates excellent and the light show is great! Everything I wanted when I bought it. Thank you! Very cool and functional.",2021,03
"This mouse feel different from others I used, it’s light , comfortable and easy to control. My hand doesn’t have stretch pain after using this mouse at work  for whole shift, not light the old one .",2021,03
"Every time I use the mouse, there is this high-pitched noise! Hurts my ears",2021,03
"I purchased 2 for our office.  The mouse looked nice and the colors were pretty, but mine started having problems just a few days later.  It was unresponsive and jerky for a few days.  Then it stopped working (despite charging overnight).  I tried charging on different outlets to make sure the outlet wasn't bad, but it wouldn't hold a charge and died again within minutes.  When I asked the other employee about his identical mouse (different color) he said his never seemed to work right and wouldn't hold a charge.  I used the included cord and tried charging with the computer, with a hub, with a power strip, and with a charging block (not included) plugged into multiple outlets.When returning, I packaged the items as requested and requested the pick-up slip.  We found the return slip face down on the ground on the sidewalk several feet in front of our office a few days later- not stuck to the door or in the mailbox mounted next to our front door.  No one knocked to let us know it was delivered and we wouldn't have found it if a staff member hadn't gone out to sanitize the outside door handles.  Now we have to take it to a drop off location because a return pickup is going to cost $7 (despite the package being ready to send before the return sticker was dropped off).  I am unhappy with both the item and the return and have already ordered similar replacements from another seller.",2021,03
"This light up mouse is great, and I've had a few similar ones. I like that this one is rounded on the edges (more aesthetically pleasing, imo).It holds a charge for long enough that it's not annoying, though It would be nice if there was an option to turn the light off while using to save charge even more. The options are just ""on"" (constant red light) or ""*"" (cycles through colors). Clicks are definitely as close to silent as you could get.The only thing that is bothering me is that the wheel is squeaking after only 3 weeks of use. I intend to drop some WD40 onto it and I'm sure that will fix the problem, but I don't think that should be necessary to begin with.Overall a good choice, though!IMMEDIATE UPDATE: Directing WD40 into the ""wheel well"" of the mouse is not easy, even using a pin. Dropped the mouse, and now the wheel doesn't scroll at all, it just spins. Soooooo not great. Removing a star. Either a) accept the squeaky wheel or b) be VERY careful when trying to oil said wheel because if you drop it it will die. UGH",2021,03
"Idk if I would say this is a great mouse for gaming but, it’s great for the price and very smooth. Different setting are great too. Flip the lights on and it’s like a rave in your hand!",2021,03
"I like it, it's comfortable it's half as much as the one I was buying and does exactly the same thing. And the Pretty Lights make it good to look at also... 😁",2021,03
There’s nothing I dislike about this wireless mouse that I use with my laptop computer!  I would recommend this to anyone that would ask me about it!,2021,03
this mouse worked great... for the 5 days it worked. i tried turning it on today and it wont light up or connect to my computer. tried connecting with the cord provided but still wont work. sucks because the outlook of the mouse was cool along with the led outlining.,2021,03
It quit working after 32 days and they wouldn't take it back or refund.,2021,03
"One drop to the floor, it broke😩",2021,03
I really like this mouse. It is light and re-action is immediate. I also like its USB input. Great product.,2021,03
"it’s sooo pretty! and very easy to use. just as described online, HIGHLY recommend!! I love rose gold.",2021,03
"Small, good shape, easy to install.",2021,03
Not bad. Pretty smooth operation. No delays in movement. Connects quickly to any lap top.,2021,03
Worked great before it died after 2 months of ownership.,2021,03
I really like the slim size.  It fits into a ravel bag nicely.  I love that it can be turned off for travel and not have to remove the battery.  The Colorful lights are a nice touch.,2021,03
"Decent little wireless mouse, priced good for children who tend to lose and destroy things. Biggest issue is the charging cable that comes with it is garbage. Can be charged using a phone charger. All in all a decent purchase and would buy again!",2021,03
"Just got this last night for my new ACER, when I plugged in the mouse the curser just jumps around (with usb or usb C plug).  It zig-zags across the screen when trying to move in a straight line.  It stops just short of moving to the edges of the screen and you have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision.  I charged it overnight and same results this morning, I adjusted the DPI with the button and it just jumps faster around the screen. I tried troubleshooting but I can use any other mouse in my house and they work just fine so I will be returning this mouse and purchasing something that works.",2021,03
I bought 2 and we love them,2021,03
Excellent mouse.Very smooth.,2021,03
"Exactly what it says, quite and convenient mouse.",2021,03
I would not recommend this mouse as it feels like the plastic will break on you at any second. It's very cheaply made and the light shines through the top layer of plastic which makes it look way worse!,2021,03
"Great portable mouse.  The color changing is fun, and setup was easy. Lightweight, ergonomic device.  It was also a great value.",2021,03
Worked for about a week.,2021,03
"Convenient, quite, excellent connection with computer",2021,03
DO NOT BUY!!!!  The product does not work for intended purposes... using as a mouse for my computer. It lights up and thats it!  I can’t leave zero stars... I would if I could.,2021,03
"loved it while it worked, yet here we are two months later and it literally just stopped working. I've tried multiple usb-c ports to no avail. I guess you get what you pay for",2021,03
"Love this mouse, it lives up to its description!",2021,03
USB is not compatible with the USB port of a laptop or a desktop.,2021,03
This mouse is very slim and is comfortable on your wrist. The colors are really cool and mouse battery goes for a couple of days,2021,03
So pretty and super quiet,2021,03
"I like the mouse. Originally, I thought it wast great for the price and I’m glad to be wrong. The mouse is a little sensitive because I dropped it once causing it to freeze somewhat. However, after re-installing it, it seemed to fix the issue. I also am enjoying the colour changing which helps me relax almost. Overall, highly recommend as it is compatible with pc and mac. Just plug and play.",2021,03
Not practical for me fir everyday use,2021,03
"This comes exactly as described, it works great and is easy to recharge",2021,03
"The mouse is very light and easy to use, and the changing led colors are very nice to look at.",2021,03
It’s a good mouse.,2021,03
It's sleek and there's no clicking noise when pressing mouse buttons. The (optional) lights on the mouse also helps me when I'm studying at night. I will definitely buy more of these and recommend to my work staff.Excellent Product at a great price.Good Job,2021,03
Super cute mouse. I love the color and I love the LED lights. My only issue is that it's very glitchy. Like it seems to want to do its own thing which isn't good. I sit at a desk for 8 hours and it's a completely flat surface and the mouse will move all on its own.,2021,03
Absolutely love this mouse. If it were to break I would buy this product again!!,2021,03
"Since I mainly draw art, I didn't see a need to have a bulky gaming mouse. This fits perfectly in my hand and has very quiet clicks which is ideal when I'm drawing at night while the family is asleep. The ability to switch between changing colors or just plain mouse mode is very useful for me. I enjoy the fact that you can turn it off with that very switch too as most mice at this price range never have that option! It's a good buy for a casual office or laid back working experience.",2021,03
I got this to replace my white one that broke well let’s just say I love it. It stays charged a very long time and the color change is beautiful,2021,03
Love it!,2021,03
I bought for my son and he loves it. Compact and portable.,2021,03
Pretty but dies quick even with new batteries we returned it,2021,03
My order came fast and on time. I use this little mouse at work all the time. It is lightweight and slim enough to put in my scrub pocket for travel. Easy to clean. Only thing I see is that I cannot tell when the battery runs low. I keep an extra mouse handy for those times. But other than that no complaints!,2021,03
"I like the design and feel of the mouse.  My concern is that it tends to go to sleep and anytime I have not used it for a few minutes, I have to press the button on top and then it does come right back on.  I guess with time I will learn to do that each time I want to use it.  In use, it does not function as smoothly as I had hoped it would, hesitating to start and then the curser ""hops"" when I am trying to drag it from one place to another.",2021,03
"Great product, very nice and very nice price, my daughter love it!",2021,03
This mouse will not stay connected to my computer,2021,03
 I love it it’s so easy to handle I give it out of 1 to 10 I’ll go for the 10❤️❤️ For sure ❤️,2021,03
"I purchased this mouse because I was tired of having to uninstall and re-install a bluetooth mouse I was using.  This mouse is very responsive, fits nicely in my small hand, and is an excellent buy for the price. The battery lasts and turns itself off after no use for awhile.",2021,03
This mouse is very comfortable and ergonomic. It is also very silent. The LED lights are very calming. Love it 10000% recommended.,2021,03
"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap, CheapQuit working like day 3 and now I am outside of return window.  Good thing it was cheap.  Buyers beware...spend a little more.",2021,03
Real like this mouse! It stays charged for a long time!!,2021,02
"It’s basic, sleep mode is irritating.",2021,02
"UPDATE 1:: Had it charging for less than a minute and the whole house smelled like burning plastic. In that time, the cord got super hot, and the part where it plugged into the mouse was super hot as well. Probably would have caught fire if left unattended.UPDATE 2:: Using different cords was just fine. DO NOT USE THE CORD THAT COMES WITH IT!!!UPDATE 3:: Battery won't hold a charge... I was really wanting this mouse to work, but looks like I'm returning it after all.",2021,02
Great mouse! Bought second one to take to work,2021,02
"Mouse arrived the next day.  Easy to set up and use.  Have had no problems at all,  it’s works as it should.",2021,02
This mouse did not work. The wireless receiver did work so the mouse did not connect to my laptop.,2021,02
"This mouse is seriously cool! It’s comfy, quiet click and has a light show!",2021,02
" I am in love with this mouse its just perfect for the price, I been using it a lot and only need to charge it once, I really recommend it.",2021,02
My son loves it.,2021,02
"I really like my new mouse.  Its light, and works better with my hand, the sleep mode is awesome my kids love the colors, I did some gaming last night and it worked great, I play league of legends,",2021,02
Love the slimness of the mouse without loosing great functionality.  The re-charge feature is great.,2021,02
I use it for a gaming laptop and it’s honestly amazing. Easy to set up and great for the price.,2021,02
Sleek and very kewl...low profile and easy on the hands....very satisfied with my product...😁,2021,02
I have small hands and it feels great on it.  It’s light and pretty.  Live that it changes colors.  Haven’t used it for gaming though.,2021,02
"This is the second time I buy it. It has everything .. no need for battery .. you hock it up to a laptop for charging and that's it.. comfortable while holding it..moving smoothly and got very appealing look. I bought another one from another brand and stopped working after awhile. This one is the real deal and no more exploring other mouses, I'm sticking with it.",2021,02
"I bought this mouse, because I saw it was a wireless ""silent"" click. Which was perfect for me working in a class room and not loving to hear the click of a mouse all day. I have dropped it 3 + times and each time I have been able to just move the plastic back into place and ""repair"" so the duriablily from drops is awesome for when I move between classes to see my different classes.",2021,02
Beautiful. My daughter loves it!,2021,02
"It makes an almost mute power sound when I use it, which can become annoying when I use it in a silent room. The light also makes the internal part of the mouse visible. Other than that, it works well.",2021,02
"My kiddo needed a wireless mouse to take with him to school and this was so fun for him! It’s light weight, pretty durable, and I love that he can charge it along with his laptop at night.",2021,02
"Wasn't expecting much because it seemed low priced, but have been using daily for work for about a month now and it's wonderful.  No issues.  I actually bought two of them, one grey and one gold, and they both work fine.",2021,02
this mouse works but has a high pitch noise the entire time in use !. drives me crazy .,2021,02
Was trying to find a mouse for my new laptop and came across this mouse. The best one I've found. I like that it's smooth and the color is super nice.,2021,02
It was a great value. It arrived quickly. It works great. The usb-c doesn't fit my port but the mouse only need usb.,2021,02
"The mouse is really quiet, no clicking sound, which I liked.  Comfortable for the hand. Does not hold a charge very long, and nothing worse than not responding during middle of the work day. I had tried to different brands, the other was one that had bluetooth feature, so I could use it on my tablet. That held a charge all week and I will be getting another one of those.",2021,02
"Love this new mouse! I work from home for my job still and use my mouse all day everyday. I was originally using a big bulky gaming mouse ( it lights up and looked cool) for the last 2 years, but now my hand is starting to hurt and was ready to downgrade to something smaller and lighter. I saw this and had to see what it was about. Let me tell you I LOVE this new mouse. Its so small and light and easy to use. The clicks are super quiet and feels so great in the hand. Yes it is plastic but it actually doesn't feel cheap and feels like a good build. It's very responsive and glides very smooth. The only gripe is to wake of up from Sleep you have to click the mouse button, instead of just moving it like most items, but that's a very minor issue. Oh, and the different colors it comes In is nice. Also, the RGB color changing lighting is a very nice effect. I definitely recommend this mouse for home or office use.",2021,02
Product as described. Looks great with the lights. Ordered twice!,2021,02
Love the product bought for my Microsoft surface pro and it works perfectly,2021,02
I love the way this mouse performs.,2021,02
This mouse stop working within 2 months of purchase. Plugged into computer via mouse with included cord and it still didn't work. Throwing in trash!!!,2021,02
Fits prefect in my hand and the lights are great to keep tack of the mouse in a dark room.,2021,02
"The mouse was working good and out of no where in the middle of me working it clicker just stop functioning.. Unfortunately, I purchase this item on the 10th of January and my return window is now close. I really felt confident about this product and it is was nice while it lasted.Edit: I was spent a replacement and it has given me any problems.",2021,02
"I’ve had this mouse since August 2021 and I don’t like writing reviews until I’ve had the item for a bit. This mouse worked great and I love how quiet it is, however about 4 weeks ago it started giving me trouble. I find myself tapping it with medium force on the desk in order for the cursor to move. I charge it completely and even completely charged, it gives me these issues.",2021,02
It was easy to setup the mouse works perfectly and I absolutely love the color change lighting!,2021,02
Looks good. Works well,2021,02
"I needed and slim mouse that was rechargeable. This little mouse saved the day!! It is ergonomic and glides smoothly on the mouse pad. I am pleased with this purchase, and the changing lights are an extra bonus!! Good, quality product.",2021,02
"Could use an instruction sheet.  Also, what is the expected battery life on a single charge.”?",2021,01
Not having to change the battery is what drew me to this but it goes to sleep to save power and is hard to get it working again. I thought the slim profile mouse would be ok and better for travel but it is too hard to hold. I thought it might just be my big hands and gave it to my wife. She gave it back and said it was hard for her to hold on too.,2021,02
Excellent product works right out the box,2021,02
Very smooth and easy to use. Just a good all around product.,2021,02
I love this mouse. I got the pink (gold rose) one. It's first of all so elegant.And the best part is that it's mute! The clicks are soft and smooth.,2021,02
This is a nice size mouse and I love the color and lights. You have to charge it overnight if you use it all day like I do for work.,2021,02
Love this but it looses its juice within 8 hours without it being plugged in. I work a 12 hour shift so I have to plug it in during a very busy shift so I need one with a battery,2021,02
"Absolute garbage!!! Day 2 of using. If you have it on the multicolor setting the mouse will not work. I should have known something was up when the instructions were only in mandarin. It went straight to the trash can after i couldn’t get it to work. It also feels super cheap. Please if you’re reading these reviews, we’re not lying. DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE!",2021,02
I love how smooth and easy it is to handle. I just can't change the setting from all red to multicolor to the color I want : Purple.  So I mean I wait for Purple to come around and in happy with it. It does what I need. NEEDS BETTER DETAIL INSTRUCTIONS,2021,02
This mouse is great as an everyday tool because of its ergonomics and functionability.,2021,02
"This was a nice mouse, I wouldn't recommend for children as it broke when dropped on floor. Adult use seems like it would be fine.",2021,02
Love everything about it. I recommend it.,2021,02
"I love the way the mouse looks and feels, but oh the mistakes I make! This mouse has a mind of it's own and jumps all over the place. I have accidentally closed files/programs while working on them, move public folder (and having to contact IT to move back), and many more random errors as a result of this erratic mouse. Sometimes, while not even using the mouse - I can see the curser go on walkabout all over my screen. Perhaps there is a ghost in the machine, but if so, they are hostile... I will be replacing it ASAP!",2021,02
" I wish I would have seen the video from another reviewer with the white mouse before I purchased the white one.I don't like the fact that the light is visible throughout the whole mouse. I assumed it would just be a line of light that circles the mouse as shown in the sellers pictures. If you like the look of the whole mouse lighting up as shown in the video then this is the mouse for you.Overall, I do like the mouse and don't want to deal with exchanging. I planned on getting the mint and I should have gone with my instincts. It glides smoothly and the clicks are slient. I won't be returning it because I do like it but just diappointed the white one was not as shown/described",2021,02
Loved it... until it stopped working and wouldn’t charge in a couple months... now just junk.,2021,02
"Really nice rat, I would definitely recommend.It feels great, rechargeable, cool LED colors and WIRELESS!",2021,02
I have been using for about 6 weeks and it died. It will not charge.,2021,02
"A rechargeable cordless mouse is such a good idea and invention. You don't have to deal with batteries.  And this mouse seemed not to need recharging for over a day.. Great!!This one I bought worked well even though it did something odd,  (and I am not sure if it was the mouse or the ""inexpensive"" tablet computers that I use,  or maybe the USB splitters that I use, however it was probably the mouse ) but  after using the mouse normally for a few hours,  the mouse  would then  not show the arrow on the screen and I found that I would have to turn off the swatch on the mouse and then turn it back on again. It was  as if  I had to re-boot the mouse periodically.  It seemed to have  nothing to do with recharging. This would happen even after the mouse had been fully recharged.  It would be unpredictable as to when it would happen but overall even that was  a minor flaw.But then one day, ( actually the date of this writing March 16 2021)  I put the mouse receiver into a different receptacle to use a different tablet computer  and it would not work no matter what I tried to do.  Then I decided to take out the receiver from the USB receptacle  and found that the metal, square part on the receiver stuck into the USB receptacle.  So this leads me to believe that possibly the mouse receiver  became faulty with regular use over  a few weeks  since I bought it.  Otherwise the way that the receiver was made was not in the best possible way. Not rugged enough maybe.However though I don't know  at this point  if this is the way that  ALL these rechargeable mouses are  (this brand)  or if this particular one that I bought  just did not actually pass quality control at the factory,  it seems the company should give me a replacement.I am going to see about it but I guess  I will be told that the deadline for returns had been reached.I will update if I am able to.",2021,02
The wife loves it. we use it for the camera system,2021,02
"This mouse is great, and if it didn't do this one annoying thing I would give it 5 stars. It emits a really high pitched squeal when you don't use a mousepad. It coincides with the LED light color change, if you pick it up and set it down, it makes a really high frequency sound that is very irritating if you work in a quiet environment, which I do. It's similar to a smoke alarm if it were far away. Get one that doesn't have the lights, that should help.",2021,02
"The only thing I do not like is having to charge it with a usb.  Sometimes I’m trying to use it and it’s dead, so I connect to computer and I can use it.  Works best with longer cord that I don’t have.",2021,02
It's A great mouse to have if you are trying to have a mouse that can be used on a type c only device while keeping the option of normal USB open.,2021,01
"I HAD THE MOUSE CHARGING ALL WEEKEND. WHEN I RETURNED TO WORK MONDAY MORNING, I SMELLED SOMETHING HOT, BUT NO ONE ELSE SMELLED ANYTHING. I WENT TO UNPLUG MY MOUSE AND MY CORD WAS SO HOT I COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH IT. THE ENTIRE CORD MELTED AND THE WIRES HAD BURNED THROUGH THE RUBBER COATING. VERY EASILY COULD HAVE CAUGHT MY COMPUTER ON FIRE. DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE UNLESS YOU HAVE GREAT FIRE INSURANCE!",2021,02
"The scrolling wheel doesn’t work, my daughter was so excited to use this but it won’t scroll. Other than that, cute mouse.",2021,02
It doesn’t move! I used for 2days and gave up! Really bad ...,2021,02
"Works good, my son loves it",2021,02
This mouse works great and I love that it's rechargeable. Just plug it in to my laptop for a couple hours and we're good to go.,2021,02
I used this for my security system and works very good.  Easy to set up,2021,01
Performs as advertised and is easy to plug in and use.,2021,01
Love it!,2021,01
Great wireless mouse! Super quiet clicks!,2021,01
Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money this cheap flimsy mouse that only works for a couple of weeks.,2021,01
"Great at first... then after a month, it stopped working - it's like the battery was weak and it was slow to respond to movement and felt sticky.  Do not recommend.",2021,01
"Very good quality. Sleek and pretty. I use it for my desk at work. The only issue is when I'm using it to scroll a page, the ball starts squeaking. Otherwise it's great.",2021,01
GOOD MOUSE FOE EVERY DAY USE,2021,01
I thought this mouse was gonna work really good and  last a long time based on the reviews. Unfortunately the charger that came with the mouse isn't charging the mouse. I tried everything to get it to work and would not. The mouse worked for a few hours before dying on me. Not a good purchase and not satisfied with their product.,2021,01
I love all the colors this mouse has keep on thru the nite last a long time on one charge,2021,01
Works great!!!,2021,01
Good,2021,01
Works well and the color matches my laptop perfectly!,2021,01
"Simply put, it is a great mouse for what it's worth. However, I had difficulty connecting the mouse to my macbook pro with the USB c adapter that comes with the product. I have 4 ports. The manual (grammar is terrible btw) tells you to try different ports which they claim it will work normally in one of them.. NONE OF THEM WORKED which was a bummer.. then I tried with my own adapter and it connected it right away! The adapter they provide you is just useless. So if you plan on getting this mouse to use with your macbook, you should get a separate adapter. Once I connected it though, it seemed to work perfectly..smooth tracking, silent clicks and the RGB lighting is beautiful. I just got it today so hopefully, it will keep working the way they claim it should work.",2021,01
The wireless feature and recharging from computer.,2021,01
"Just go to your local department store. When I opened the package and inspected the mouse, it had obvious scratches and looked like there was some wear on the bottom. It works and gets the job done. I bought this mouse because I was tired of buying batteries for another wireless mouse. The mouse will not work when you have it plugged into the computer to charge.",2021,01
stopped working. Cant return either.,2021,01
"Doesn't stay charged long enough, bought 2 and both are the same.  Sometime on down the road, I'llput new rechargeable batteries in both, and see if that is the problem.. They do fit nice to use, and runsmooth.",2021,01
Good mouse for regular use. Great rgb lighting,2021,01
Super easy to use. Just plug in to do the initial charge and then recharge via the USB cord as needed. Kinda fun to have the light display change colors throughout the day. Soft touch when you right or left click and barely makes any clicking noise.,2021,01
"Worked fine for what was needed, fell off of the table one time and broke in half. Wouldn’t purchase again for my disabled mother.",2021,01
"Just ordered this as a nice wireless mouse for my Surface Pro. It works nice but when I went to pull the USB out of the Surface pro, part of it stayed stuck in the port.  I had to use pliers to pull it out. Not sure if this just a tight fit or poor workmanship.  Other than that the Mouse works fine.",2021,01
Love this mouse,2021,01
Its fast,2021,01
"I don't normally like using a mouse when I am on my laptop, but they built in keys on my laptop were starting to go so I decided to purchase a mouse. When looking for a mouse, I wanted something sleek and able to take with me to school and back. It fits my hand perfectly and I enjoy how sleek it looks. The only thing that I would change is being able to decide the color(s) and color patterns. Other than that, it was worth the purchase.",2021,01
Product stopped working shortly after a month. Wouldn’t click properly.,2021,01
"I was looking for a wireless rechargeable mouse because I recently lost my old mouse but I’m kind of glad I did because I really love this one! It’s super cute, sleek and the lights are so pretty. The clicks are quiet like it says in the description and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a mouse.",2021,01
"This mouse is sleek, slim, and so pretty! I love the lights! The battery goes pretty quick when using the light changing setting, but has a lower setting it lasts quite a while. Would definitely recommend it!",2021,01
I love this mouse but hate it at the same time. I love it because it’s cute and it functions well.....that is if it doesn’t run out of battery charge. During normal use the charge only lasts for about 3 days. It’s good that it can be recharged I just didn’t think I would be recharging it that often. You can tell when it’s running low because it starts jumping all over the place. I just try to remember to charge it while I’m charging my laptop. Also I was under the impression that it came as a usbc to charge and it does not. It comes with an adapter for usb to usbc. I could’ve just got an adapter for my old mouse had it been made clear.,2021,01
Love for the most part charges fast but runs out fast. Hard to see the pointer arrow have closed lots of things by accidentRn,2021,01
"Slightly annoying that it had to be recharged to even use it but the design is sleek, good size and QUIET!!",2021,01
I bought this. Love the looks and the feel however I used it for 4 days and it quit working.,2021,01
"Sensor doesn’t always pick up movements. To clarify, I am not using this f gaming but as a wireless mouse for work and coaching speech and debate. Sometimes when I sit for too long, the sensor takes time to come back online Andreas movements. This can be super frustrating when you are working and you need to move with alacrity but such is the life that one would expect from a $13 mouse.Overall, I’d you are doing menial office tasks, this is probably an okay mouse. The rechargeable batter is cool and I am happy to not have to replace batteries but I would probably go with a wired mouse in the future.",2021,01
"Nice, the only problem I've noticed so far is it's really hard to click the scroll (middle button). It's just really stiff.",2021,01
Works great and battery lasts a long time! I’ve used it everyday since i purchased it a month or so ago and havent had to charge it many times. Clicks are very quiet as well and the light setting looks amazing,2021,01
Product works great love it.,2021,01
It work super great. i recommend for other to buy,2021,01
"The click isn't loud but it does get picked up by my gaming computer recorder. The battery doesn't last near long enough, not even a whole day, even when you don't have the lights on. It does feel nice in the hand, it does track well but I would say a mouse pad isn't optional with this one.",2021,01
"I like it, it is true to no noise",2021,01
"Great product, delivery and price!",2021,01
"I'm not a mouse person, I prefer the track pad but need it for work. Absolutely love it, even use it on my personal computer",2021,01
I never write reviews. As a matter of fact this is the first I have ever written but due to the danger factor I felt compelled to.My son plugged in his mouse this morning and walked away and within a minute my husband smelled something burning and fortunately was able to get to it before the flames- yes flames reached the drapes because the charging cable caught on fire.,2021,01
Works well,2021,01
I got this mouse for my daughter and she was beyond excited when we finally received it. Well day 1 it wouldn’t charge. So i gave it a break and decided to try charging it on my Mac (she had originally tried w/ her school chrome book). Few seconds of it being plugged in & it started SMOKING. It smelled like burning plastic so I quickly just unplugged and didn’t bother doing anything else with the mouse.,2021,01
"Great mouse for travel as it is very slim and ergonomic. Perfect for the bag that has just enough space. When you’re on the go and you need to pack up and move quickly, it’s sleep mode feature is a nice adage, increasing battery life and usability. As far as gaming goes, I would recommend only lite/casual games only, not for gaming on the heavy side. Overall 9/10 would buy again",2021,01
Scroll stopped working after 2 weeks of use,2021,01
Got this to match the skin.  Works great,2021,01
I love it best mouse I've had.,2021,01
Like it,2021,01
"Very light weight and low for click sounds. Long battery life,Easy to pair. Nice feeling of touch with my hand, I love to use this mouse for my WOT game on my laptop.",2021,01
Item came broken/ definitely looks used. I tried to charge and use still but scroll doesn’t work.,2021,01
this mouse is amazing. it has completed my work from home station and has made my desk look less cluttered. what i love about it the most is the led lights. i would never definitely buy and recommend this to other people.,2021,01
Bought this mouse for my wife to use with her new MacBook Air. I must say this mouse has exceeded all expectations! Very happy with my purchase and will refer anyone looking for a quality mouse to this business.,2021,01
My daughter use's it for her laptop an plays a few games on it the battery life is fair since she does use the mouse alot i say about 5 to 6 hours countulessy,2021,01
I love the feel and look of it,2021,01
Purchased this mouse for my son to use for his school work and he loves it. The colors are fun and it moves smoothly! He also loves that it doesn’t make a clicking sound. Would recommend.,2021,01
mouse was great for about 24 hours when it stopped working.  a mouse even a snake would not like.  worthless.,2021,01
Perfect!,2021,01
"Pretty good. Was hard to use at the beginning seemed like it didnt work. It has sensitive spots. But once you get used to it, works just fine.",2021,01
love this mouse havent had to charge it at all since i got it amazing,2021,01
"I like this mouse.  The light colors constantly scroll through a rainbow and aren't static on just one color.  My office is in my bedroom, and if I leave the mouse on, it makes a great nightlight -- not too bright, but just light enough to find my way around if I wake up during the night.  I especially love the fact that it's rechargeable and that I haven't had to put any batteries in it since I bought it several months ago.The thing I don't like is that it has a tendency to do its own thing sometimes.  If I'm working on the couch and put the mouse down next to me (flat and completely still, not rolling backwards or moving at all) the cursor on the screen will sometimes take off at a diagonal, stuttering its way up and across the screen.  At other times, I will be using the mouse to click and drag something or draw a line and the cursor will suddenly jump to a completely different part of the screen, or it will ""hiccup"" and lose the hold on what I was clicking and dragging or cause the line to wobble (sometimes quite sharply, kind of like trying to draw a straight line in the car when the tire hits a pothole).It's a good little mouse, and aside from the spastic glitches, I'm pleased with it, but I am getting tired of not having full control right when I need it most.  I may keep this one for its nightlight capabilities and shop for another rechargeable mouse to use with my computer.",2021,01
It does not work and I have tried to reach the seller. Instructions in chinese and simply poor poor service. Purchase at own peril. great disappointment for my kid.,2021,01
"it was going well for a few weeks then, my son dropped his MacBook and the usb type-c connected BROKE! its so easy to break and I would not recommend",2021,01
"My daughter needed a wireless mouse for her laptop. I came across this one and bought it for it's cool features, size, and price. It is so smooth and she loves using it along with that fact that it lights up; goes with her LED lights in her room. You won't be disappointed with this mouse.",2021,01
"I really like how sleek this mouse is, it extremely functional and the lights add a cool “futuristic” type of vibe making my experience enjoyable every time. Another neat function is the silent clicker, I work early mornings so to not wake up my family with the constant clicking of a noisy mouse is definitely a luxury. I’m happy with my purchase.",2021,01
Like,2021,01
"Absolutely nothing i disliked about this product. Its better than advertised - only thing is it looks as though it was made in China, yeech. But it is a very good product, going to get another one",2021,01
Easy to use,2021,01
"This is the coolest mouse I’ve ever had. Sleek, modern, high tech and sexy lights! Everything. Slips in my briefcase with my new ultra thin laptop. Sweet!!",2021,01
I purchased the rose gold and it matches my Airbook 13. Charges fast and lasts a long time between charges. Glad I bought this wireless mouse. I use it for 8 hrs a day 5 days a week.,2021,01
"The mouse is a colorful addition to my desk and, unlike other computer mice I have owned, it does NOT have thumb-operated controls on its left side, where a left-handed person like myself would unintentionally press a button and start a function they didn't want to activate.  I've only had it for about a week, so it remains to be seen how frequently it needs to be recharged; the light display draws a significant amount of power, so I need to remember to turn the mouse off whenever I shut down the PC.",2021,01
Love it,2021,01
" The black feels super soft. I just plugged it into my USB-C on my computer. It also comes with a USB adapter Incase you don’t have that. Left and right button clicks softy not annoyingly. Middle scroll works great, the click is a bit louder and it won’t click onto a document so that click that doesn’t do anything. Happy with this purchase, it looks great at night and it’s such a gamer / music producer look.",2021,01
"great mouse for price, thought it was bluetooth, but its not. still good though",2021,01
It is sleek and I like the fact that I can charge it on my computer. It does light up and it works great. After sitting for a while the mouse needs to wake up by pressing the right click.,2021,01
"Some of the reviews on how this mouse did not work after the first use caused me apprehension, but given the price, I took the risk.  It is just what I needed, and it is really pretty as well.  Great product.",2021,01
Purchased as a gift for my nephew. He really likes it.,2021,01
"3 month update: This thing squeals now! It took me a week to figure out why I kept hearing a high pitched whine every time I moved my cursor, and eventually I realized that something inside the mouse is creating a very high pitched squeal every time I move it -- that, on top of the mouse dying in about a day of use now, means that this thing is a no-go. Definitely buy something else, this thing has been a total headache since I got it.The battery on this mouse doesn't seem to last a very long time, after about two days of usage it'll die. I find myself plugging it in every night to make sure I don't have to deal with that.Additionally, the thing goes to sleep after about a minute or two without movement -- super annoying, you have to click the mouse to wake it up again, and doing so registers a click wherever your mouse was left on screen before it went to sleep. Can't recommend it for any type of work that requires small periods of typing or reading, you'll end up waking up the mouse from its weird sleep about a million times.",2021,01
My mouse decided to stop working and forced me to have to get a new one. I found this one and thought I would give it a try. I am so glad that I did. It's sleek and stylish and I love that it lights up. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a sleek and fun mouse.,2021,01
"Love this mouse. Makes my productivity rate hight while using my laptop and glad the light doesn't have to be on, because it can be very distracting.",2021,01
Item received Charger Does not work,2021,01
I used this once and when it died I charged it for a few days and it still won’t work.,2021,01
"This is an excellent product. It’s lightweight, has a very smooth rolling actio , and I LOVE the way it looks!!! I highly recommend this mouse!!!!!",2021,01
It only worked for 1 month. Do not recommend.,2021,01
The metal casing for the USB remote came  off and is now stuck  in the USB port of my computer,2021,01
"First, the left mouse click is not sensitive enough, requiring a longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click. Annoying, and I'm betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder/longer. Another less significant annoyance: make sure you don't turn on the light feature. It looks cool, but the thing acts like a lava light night light, continually changing colors of light even when not in use (even with the computer off), which will run down the battery. I like the rechargeable feature, but I will be looking for another mouse.",2021,01
The mouse is sleek and comfortable. I enjoy the sleep mode because I am terrible about turning off my mouse when I'm not using. Setup is simple since it has an adapter.,2021,01
Got it for my wife she seems to like it it looks nice and feels good in hand.,2021,01
"I love this mouse , I've had others before  but never like this , it was so easy to connect,  just  plug in the USB connector and thats it , no drivers to install  or to download  , works  right out the box .. its so natural  when using  this mouse  , I even used it when I was in the coach and it worked perfectly on the arm rest , I would  recommend this all day , good product..",2021,01
 I was in the market for a new mouse as my Logitech wireless was going bad on me. I was red to stay wireless and had a budget. The Logitech and other named brands were just too expensive when I wanted one that looked cool. And the cheaper ones were too normal looking. I got this one as it was cheap and the led lights were a cool feature. I got it and it feels great. It feels like an apple mouse and the buttons were really quiet and didn’t have the typical mouse click sound.Edit: I had to get a other mouse as my first broke. It was completely my fault as it had fell and was stepped on by accident. Since it was so cheap I just bought another and it works as well as the first.,2021,01
Very smooth use love the different colors.,2021,01
Lasted 4 months,2021,01
"Hi,I have purchased this product for my daughter, so happy with the overall looks and performance. I will recommend you to buy... great buy.",2021,01
"The mouse only works if directly next to the usb port it is plugged into, so it is useless if using it a foot below (on a keyboard tray).  The instructions are not in english to try and troubleshoot.",2021,01
"Love it. It fits my hand, just right. Only issue is that it came in another language..",2021,01
I have been needing a wireless mouse for the longest and this product was definitely what i was looking for. Nice sleek feel and has a long battery life so I'm glad I bought it.,2021,01
Everything went smoothly! The mouse looks awesome and works perfect!,2021,01
"Decent while it worked ( though waking from sleep required switching it off & back on underneath ). The laser stopped working ( fully charged up ), only color lights work, making it useless.",2021,01
This mouse is perfect!I bought it to match with my keynote light up keyboard and it matches better than I expected. The colors change while gaming just as my keyboard does and it works perfectly for gaming and normal day-to-day use.Would buy again.,2021,01
This mouse worked one time and hasn't worked since. I have tried charging it and flipping it to different settings. It lights up and that is all that it does.,2021,01
"I'm not rating this one star because it is a cute mouse and I like the design. For some reason, I found my MacBook trackpad more comfortable to use than this mouse. My wrists were hurt within a couple hours of using this mouse. That being said, I used it in moderation. I wanted to like it. However, I received this mouse January 4th. As of January 31, responsiveness has gone downhill. After taking it off the charger (it has a short battery life), it takes about 30 seconds and moving the scroll wheel for it to respond again. Even then, it might have some hard to ignore hiccups.",2021,01
i have one and my grandson liked it so i got him one for his birthday,2021,01
"For $10, you are better off getting a wired mouse. This thing is so bad, the sensor light bleeds through the top  shell of the mouse. Worse is that the actual functionality is very poor, if your are looking for an accurate mouse, this is not it. I have a multi colored mouse pad and the sensor struggles between the change in shades making this mouse difficult to use. If you have a plain color mouse pad this may be acceptable, but if your on the go, this will not do.",2021,01
"Highly recommend, silent click is great. You have the option to turn off the color changing mode.",2021,01
Would recommend and would buy again.,2021,01
"Easy to setup, just plug in the USB and it works. Smooth cursor movement and clicking, but the wheel does not scroll very well. Only moves the screen a few lines and then it quits scrolling all together.",2021,01
"Great so far, I use it for my MacBook Pro and I'm really enjoying it. Great touch and super lightweight.",2021,01
Super quiet! You just don't hear any clicks.  Love that it is rechargeable instead of replacing batteries. I have had it for weeks and I have only charged it twice.,2021,01
Great mouse,2021,01
"I really enjoy the feel of the mouse, it's slick which has put less strain on my wrist but I'll still be getting a wrist support. The colors don't need to be turned on and when left in middle, it keeps the mouse on with only the red light from underneath.",2021,01
I love the color and the light the most. It’s so easy to use and the best part is not having to download drivers.,2021,01
"I am old school when it comes to navigating the screen.  I work much faster with a wireless mouse.  Everything about this mouse is great EXCEPT you gotta to charge it.  Mouse that require batteries work for a very long time. Months in fact.  The charge on this mouse doesn't last long.  I have to remember to turn it off when I'm not using it.  I also have to remember to plug it into charge after long use.  Starts acting sluggish as power runs down.  My old mouse is 15 years old.  I wanted a cool new one to match my new laptop.  This one has a soft smooth click.  The LED lights are really fun.  However, I threw away the box before I tried it out.  I would send it back if I had kept shipping material.  I'll just keep the old one close when the new one is charging.  So much for progress.i",2021,01
I made sure that this product was gonna be a good one and i was not disapointed. It's silent click which is nice. The lights look awesome on it. It was just worth it.,2021,01
WENT THROUGH BATTERYS LIKE CRAZY . AND DID NOT LAST LONG .I WAS DISAPOINTEDIT IN IT,2021,01
"It took less than a day for the receiver to fall apart in my usb port, now the shell is stuck and I have to take my computer to get it pulled out.",2021,01
I love the lights and the easy set up.,2021,01
"UPDATE: I have upped my review from 2 to 3 since I reached out to the seller and they offered to send a replacement USB dongle. Will update the review again once that has been received. **I would have given this mouse five stars a month ago, but yesterday when I removed the USB dongle from my laptop the thing fell apart in my hands and the mouse is now worthless. I tried to piece it back together but it won't stay together. It's a shame because this mouse is really cool looking, feels nice in my hand, and holds a charge a long time. Very disappointed!",2021,01
"This is a very user friendly modle.  Very light weight, silent, rechargable, and easy to move around.  Just one suggestion, it will be better if the instruction has English version.",2021,01
"This item is very good.  I haven't used it enough to determine the capacity of the battery, but I'm happy with it so far.",2021,01
Needed a mouse for my laptop. Lights are awesome.,2021,01
Works great,2021,01
I bought this for my daughter who received a new laptop for Christmas.  She loves the led lights.  It was easy to set up and use.  Works wonderfully.,2021,01
"I bought this mouse because mine went bellyup.  I am thoroughly pleased with this one.  It's easy to use, easy to charge (a plus) and a all around nice mouse and YES, I'd buy it again!!!",2021,01
It’s wireless but not Bluetooth very misleading as it was  recommended with the other mice that was. A total waste of money but fits nicely in your palm with small hands.,2021,01
Stopped working after a week even if I plugged it into the computer,2021,01
I love it!,2021,01
"pretty good for price, works",2021,01
Soo cute!!! Very sleek design.  I love that it came with the Type C attachment.  I have a new laptop that doesn't have USB ports.  Oh yea!! The rose gold color matches my laptop perfectly!!! The color changing lights around thw mouse are to die for.... very cool feature,2021,01
"was very hard to click,not worth $ 15",2021,01
"This is an awesome little mouse; connection was super easy, it’s quiet(as a mouse) and compared to my last mouse, silent ❤️. The buttons work great, it feels really smooth and I think the size is perfect for me :)",2021,01
"My old mouse needed 2 AA batteries and they always needed changing because it didn't sleep. This mouse is awesome. Holds a good charge, falls asleep, mulitple dpi and cool lights too. I should have gotten this sooner!",2021,01
Beautiful wireless mouse. Makes a day in the office brighter,2021,01
Truly amazing product,2021,01
" Love this mouse; and I don’t believe I have ever said that.  Great economic shape, love the color, and the light feature  is almost mesmerizing... AND rechargeable!",2021,01
Goes through batteries like water,2021,01
"Is almost tiny for my hands and very light. Works so good and decently priced I'll learn to use it for surfing the web. Yet let me mention it seems the curve under shape is fine for my thumb side, but the pinky finger side is going to take some getting used to. Many times my pinky then fingers slide right under it or lift it off the surface slightly no matter how gentle I think I'm holding it.  In the past I've had taller models that have a flair formed to keep the fingers in position. In construction using stuff that requires a good grip, makes this like using a feather I barely feel. Makes me wonder how it would be for gaming if you got excitement and need to make a lot fast moves. Elves would love this thing though and it scrolls and moves around so good, I may even make a flange for my fingers and to give it some weight without an old fashioned battery weighing it down. It is cool with the lights no joke,  a good choice since many look just like this and perhaps everybody else has more grip control, lol, yet thank you, I found another fun product on Amazon again.",2021,01
"I purchased this mouse for my chromebook which only has a mousepad. I enjoy that it really lights up. It is lightweight and an easy glide finish. It's wireless and rechargable. The wireless adapter fits in the bottom of the mouse. So, you don't lose it.",2021,01
I absolutely love this mouse!! It’s so quiet and I love the different color lights as I use it. I salís like how comfortable it is to use. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.,2021,01
Wish you could select the color of the rgb light. It just cycles through all of them. Nothing in the instructions so it must only cycle. Besides that it’s nice. Super quiet click. Clicking the scroll wheel is loud and hard though.,2021,01
"The right click button stopped working within a few weeks.  Troubleshot by reboot , control panel settings, and even  recharge overnight.  No luck.",2021,01
 Although it's pretty it works great and I love the colors I got it for asthetics but it's very functional I work at home 8 hours a day and the charge is lasting quite long.,2021,01
"I have many wireless mouses (mice?) trying to find the right one for my home office/studio.  I bought this one for the slim design in the matte black finish.  It arrived and I have never used a mouse that's this quiet before, it's insane.  It feels great when I use it, it's smooth and very ergonomic.  This was definitely worth the price, and I may replace my other wireless devices with this model!",2021,01
Best mouse I’ve ever bought so glad I got it perfect for my job.,2021,01
The top is not opaque like the photos. It's translucent. There is only one lighting mode. There is no rainbow effect on the edge like the photo.,2021,01
It's cheap. My right click requires more Force than my left. The LEDs aren't that vibrant. Not ergonomic. It's a decent mouse but I wouldn't recommend it for gaming.,2021,01
"The calibration on this is terrible. I can’t even use it. It goes all over the place, doesn’t go where im directing it to go. I make calls for work on my computer and it’s hung up when I was clearly going to the opposite side of the screen. It’s terrible.",2021,01
The battery life on it is crap. You have to recharge it every few hours. It’s not worth the hassle. When it’s charged it also has some pretty bad lag or just doesn’t move the cursor the way you move the mouse.,2021,01
Granddaughter likes the lights,2021,01
you get about 8 hours use time on this and then you have to charge it up separately. Not worth the trouble.,2021,01
"The mouse lasts a good while on a charge, as it shuts itself off.A good product.",2021,01
"Stopped working after a few days of use on a brand new laptop. Will turn on, but does not function properly/lags.However great the first few days.",2021,01
"It doesn't have a tail, so it's more of a hamster, but it is a very nice hamster! It lights up really nicely and it is very accurate control of the cursor. I can't speak on it for gaming as I only use it for working from home, but I did like it enough to buy one for my work desk as well. Obviously, 10/10, did indeed by it again!",2021,01
 Small. Lightweight. Charged pretty fast and lasted quite a while. Perfect for what we need! I recommend!,2021,01
the pictures aren't accurate. It only lights up and changes as solid colors,2021,01
My daughter love the mouse.,2021,01
Don’t bother doesn’t work,2021,01
So I really like it. I like you can shut of the lights if you want.  It is sensitive so your mouse moves very easily and it's very easy for a person who has a laptop.,2021,01
"I use this mouse for work and it holds up for 8 hrs. It doesn’t take long to charge, and the changing colors is a plus! Glad I purchased",2021,01
"This is a great little mouse. It is small, responsive and I love the way the light changes colors. My hand is more relaxed when I'm using it than with my previous mouse. I have had no issues with it so far. Overall, based upon my experience thus far, this was a good purchase and I would buy it again.",2021,01
"I only used it once until it was dead and then I charged for hours, it wouldn't even turn on. So in all the charging feature does not work. :( It was a cute mouse though, but it doesn't work.",2021,01
"I did not like that it made a very faint squealing noise. The colors are pretty and the clicks are quiet. But everytime the mouse moves, you can hair a high pitch noise. The instructions were all in a foreign language as well",2020,12
" UPDATE to prior review: This mouse started out great, was so excited about it at first. Then after a couple months in, all of the sudden, the usb that goes into the computer just snaps/breaks. And, I'll add I did nothing to it. One day while working from home I moved the laptop to start work and noticed the mouse wasn't functioning. I looked to see why, then saw the usb had just cratered into a couple pieces. So now I paid $16 for nothing! Good Lord my own money too, not something my office will reimburse me for either. Nice work.",2020,12
"Clicking this mouse takes so much force I have to physically move my arm to get the leverage to do it. And if I ever pick the mouse up off the pad, my cursor moves erratically around, even if it's pointed at the ceiling.Literally the 2 most important things for a mouse: pointing and clicking, are useless on this thing.Looks nice, though.",2020,12
"On my laptop, it skips/doesn’t read about 10% of the time, making it unusable for gaming or pretty much anything that requires quick response time. I tried it on several types of mouse pads and surfaces, and it does the same no matter what.",2020,12
"VERY DISAPPOINTED I RECEVIED THIS ITEM DECEMBER 27TH , I UNOXED IT ON DECEMBER 30TH. TODAY IS JAN 20TH AND THE MOUSE STOP WORKING .",2020,12
"Not a fan. Wouldn’t sync with one computer. Worked great with the other computer, but it didn’t “sleep” when I was done with it. So the next day, the battery was dead. I’ll never remember to turn off the mouse when I’m not using it, so this is not going to be very useful.",2020,12
"Works great, just feels a little flimsy so I'm not sure how it will hold up.  I suppose it's a good value for the price.  The slowly changing colored LED lights are pretty cool.  I like that, unlike the Apple Magic Mouse, you can use this mouse while it is charging. The seller extended the warranty another 6 months after I registered it, so that gives me a little more confidence in the quality (or at least the customer service).I was compensated by the seller for this review with a refund of the purchase price of the mouse.",2020,12
The Mouse Is AMAZING You Can Pick Out Diff Colors And i LOVE How It Glows Rainbow Greatest Purchase Ever!!,2020,12
Love it and the colors❣️,2020,12
"Really like array of colors so I purchased mouse for every day workflow not gaming. The scroll wheel is a bit squeaky, that’s the only flaw. Not sure if I will keep it or put in ‘file 13’.",2020,12
"No stars will be given, this item holds no charge and interferes with the rest of my computer. This item is not useable it trusted",2020,12
"I originally ordered the white version but when I got it, I realized it was see-through. I asked the shop owner whether this was just an issue with the version I ordered or what all the white mouses look like. They’re all white, according to the shop. Because I raised concern, they were so kind to ship a different color to me free of charge. I didn’t even have to return the original!",2020,12
This mouse works excellent. It’s easy to move. Very lightweight. I love the way it lights up. Excellent buy.,2020,12
It works great. Fits my hand great. Only thing is the lights don’t work at efficiently. Happy with the product overall.,2020,12
If you need a mouse just for making your life easier while working with spread sheets or any other microsoft office tool this is perfect. I'm not quite sure how comfortable this would be for gaming though.,2020,12
No instructions in English. Sleep mode??? No ideaWorks fine and the color changing is cute,2020,12
"Using the type c port as its plug-in method does not work. While plugged in, my computer does not detect or accept the plug-in. If this is your main use in mind, do not use it.",2020,12
I really liked everything about this product!!,2020,12
it's easy to use and works well there is no loud clicking when using it. to get it to change colors you must push the on button all the way up to the top. and it changes color when you touch it which I find pretty cool,2020,12
This came with an c3 charging attachment but why? This uses a normal cell phone charger port. And all the intuitions are in Chinese. Theres a random button at the top and when I press it Nothing happens. And I dont know how to tell how much charge there is on it. Other than that I really like it so far. Its very sleek.,2020,12
This mouse is very sleek and comfortable to use. The click is very quiet. I highly recommend for the price!,2020,12
The LED lights are pretty but otherwise this mouse is not responding well and overall does not handle too well. I am disappointed and would not buy it again.,2020,12
"I was skeptical at first that such a small ergonomic mouse would work, I’m pleasantly surprised and have really enjoyed using it. I forgot to recharge it but it lets you know before it goes out by slowing down or moving from one screen to my other. I got it plugged in immediately and it kept right on working while it charged. I highly recommend this Mouse and plan on buying another to have as a backup for when I forget to charge. I really love the color changing sequence the colors are bright but not overly so just enough to make it fun.",2020,12
I use this with my macbook pro and its a good eye catcher when I'm djing.,2020,12
"This mouse is very quiet, just as advertised.  I was shocked at the lack of ""clicking"" when you push the right or left side.  That was my main push to purchase, besides the cool colors and LED lights.  I must say those are just an aestetic  bonus, but it kind of makes working fun.  This mouse is plastic, so the ""gold"" tone you see is gold plastic and the underbelly is white plastic.  It charges fast and it responds just as quickly as my older battery powered wireless mouse.  Overall, this mouse is really great.  I am glad I bought it and if you are sitting on the fence, just go ahead and get it.",2020,12
Really great for the mouse really light and wow just passed my expectations would buy again.,2020,12
USB got stuck and broke inside my computer,2020,12
The mouse was shipped fast and the packaging was in good condition. The pairing was fast and easy. I spent $100.00 on a razer mouse with the same functions and lighting it broke in six months! I'm very happy with my purchase.,2020,12
Love this: it feels like an extension of my hand!,2020,12
This broke after 1 day.,2020,12
Works great! And looks classy!,2020,12
"It's cute I guess. It is pretty cheaply made. You can just tell by the feel of it. I got the matte black one. It charges pretty fast and lasts for hours on one charge. I love the nano USB plug. It came with a cord, but I just use my phone charger. It does change colors and also has the option of turning the colors off with the little button on the bottom. The instructions are all in Chinese, but using it is pretty easy. The nano fits in a little spot under the mouse for storage and also comes with an adapter. It is quite flat, so not the best for long term use like with gaming. I'll keep it, but wouldn't purchase it again for the price.Update:I have used this cheap little mouse for HOURS every night since I got it. I've only had to charge it maybe once a week. The charge is phenomenal. Still works perfectly!!",2020,12
"I wanted a wireless mouse and this one fit my needs. It is rechargeable and can be turned off which helps save battery power. It can also be used while the charging cable is plugged in if necessary. The colors are a great touch and I use them depending on the mood I'm in at the time.  I also like being able to choose the resolution ""on the fly"" with the button on the top. I have already recommended it to a couple of friends.",2020,12
The mouse looks nice HOWEVER the instructions are in Chinese.I struggled with connecting but once I figured it out its working awesome so far. I will do an update in a few months.So far so good!!,2020,12
For gaming and sleep mode helps out a lot in college,2020,12
"its so cute, slim and pretty.",2020,12
Great product for the price...my daughter loves it! It is so quiet when you're clicking the buttons that you can hear it at all so I have decided to purchase myself one as well!,2020,12
"This mouse is amazing. I work in IT and have been working from home for quite some time. There are days where I have to work 10-12 hours. My hand does not get tired at all when using this mouse for long periods of time. It is super easy to setup...just connect to the USB and you’re done. The BEST part that I love about this mouse is that it is superrrrrrrrrr quiet! The weeks that I’m on-call, I do not have to feel discouraged and walking on eggshells when I have to respond to an urgent matter in the middle of the night and having to risk waking up my partner with the continuous mouse clicking sound. I will definitely buy another one just in case if I lose it.",2020,12
"If you are looking for a mouse that is small and slim, pretty color and one that lights up, this one does all of that and it is quiet.While the little booklet is in a foreign languageI am satisfied with my purchase and even though the seller offered,  no refund is necessary.",2020,12
Very cute but the cursor for the mouse didn’t work. All other buttons worked thou,2020,12
"Pros: matte feel, slim profile, quiet clickCons: instructions were in another language so there wasn't any information on how to set up (I guessed), came with a scratch on it, track wheel DOES NOT WORK!!",2020,12
"There's nothing majorly, egregiously wrong with this mouse but it doesn't necessarily excel at anything. The mouse is pretty light, the buttons are reasonably clicky and responsive. The sleep mode is a bit aggressive, and I find myself often annoyed with how quickly the mouse goes to sleep and I have to wait for it to reconnect before using it again.The DPI is by far the biggest problem, it doesn't feel like the DPI switch on the mouse actually does anything, and it almost feels like the DPI changes randomly while in use. I've noticed this behavior with a mouse mat, and on a flat desk alone. This may be just my unit but beware it nonetheless.Overall, it's definitely good enough for what I needed - a cheap, wireless, rechargeable mouse that is passable for office work, however I wouldn't use it for anything beyond that.",2020,12
"Sweet sleek mouse with nice color, can't wait till its nighttime to show it off",2020,12
it's not what i expected but it work,2020,12
At first I was happy with the product but now when I try to click links I have to press super hard to get it to work.  Will probably return it.,2020,12
"The description says that it is C adapter for Macbook Air. This is NOT true. You have to plug C adapter into laptop and then the USB wireless tab into the adapter. Had I know I had to use an adapter, I would not have bought this. Can not return as I need it now. Very disappointed.",2020,12
Never worked had to return. It wouldn’t connect after charging 5x,2020,12
"It works well, lights up very pretty, rechargeable, very quiet",2020,12
It’s good,2020,12
My daughter loves it. No complaints here.,2020,12
This mouse was terrible.  It worked very inconsistently and I have already replaced it with one that actually works.It was very disappointing.,2020,12
"Clicks are very Smooth and responds Great , Plus you never need BatteriesJust what I was looking for & at a reasonable Price",2020,12
 So it’s extra light easy to work and I love it for the price no pesky batteries,2020,12
"OMG this is literally one of the best mouse I've used in quite a while: I previously was using a small HP mouse and it gave me hand cramps over time. However, since switching, this mouse has revived my fingertips to give me better mobility as I complete my college assignments, or even surf the web.",2020,11
Works great,2020,11
Its lightweight. I absolutely love the changing colors.,2020,11
"My sister loves her mouse, she uses it with her laptop.",2020,11
"I use this mouse for casual surfing and scrolling, no gaming but it’s smooth and responsive and looks awesome.",2020,11
"I BOUGHT THIS MOUSE FOR BOTH MY 11 YEAR OLD BOY WHO IS A GAMER AND MY 6 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO WE JUST BOUGHT A GAMER COMPUTER FOR. SO FAR, THIS MOUSE IS AWESOME. WE LOVE THE LIGHT-UP OPTION ON THE MOUSE. IT ENHANCES THE GAMING EXPERIENCE. THE MOUSE IS LIGHTWEIGHT AND WORKS GREAT IN TERMS OF FUNCTIONALITY. SO GLAD I BOUGHT IT!",2020,11
"Mouse works good so far. Only thing that is disappointing is when I put the switch to the color setting it starts to change colors but also stops working. While its on the ""On"" position it lights up red which is better than nothing at least.",2020,11
"The dpi sensor stopped working after a couple of days, don’t buy it",2020,11
Great,2020,11
"I just got the mouse today and so far so good. It didn’t take long to fully charge . It’s sleek , lightweight & Love the different colors that it alternates. One of the best things is that the clicking sound of the mouse is not even noticeable. It’s super quiet.",2020,11
Works great! Lights are not too bright. Goes great with the gaming pad!,2020,11
"no complaints with this purchase, slim design makes it easy to pack and go",2020,11
"1) When I opened my mouse, I noticed there were scratches on the top of the mouse, towards the area where your palm would rest when in use. I also noticed that the adapter that arrived with the mouse did not fit the USB that would make the mouse compatible with my MacBook, so I had to use a different adapter. Considering I paid for a NEW $14 mouse, I was expecting to get better quality.2) Gave the mouse a second chance and this time I received one that didn't work.",2020,11
Broke after 5 days... wheel broke and went down into the mouse and doesn’t work. Wouldn’t recommend it’s cheap for a reason. I knew I shouldn’t have bought anything other than a Logitech!,2020,11
I love it! The colors make me happy it’s so comfortable to use!!,2020,11
I love the color options. It's very sleek and feels good in the hand. Battery life is also a plus. My kid uses it to game and for school. Been using it daily since Christmas and only charged it once. I definitely recommend.,2020,11
Disliked,2020,11
Started out and I loved this mouse butwithin 2 months it would not hold a charge for more tha a few hours.Annoying having to use it plugged in. I bought this for the convenience of only having to rechage every couple of days to this in unacceptable. If it was even once a day I could handle it since I like the mouse but can't stand charging every few hours. So sad.,2020,11
The wheel button feels like it requires 5x the force to activate and makes 10x the noise of the other 2 buttons. Whoever approved this should be fired straight into the sun. The wheel button gets more use in CAD software than any other button and not even 5 minutes of use and the wrist is already strained to the point where I can not continue to work.,2020,11
"The good thing is this mouse is cheap, but it feels like it too.  The wheel is terrible and the buttons are not even or flush and when moving from the wheel to the buttons your finger catches on the button.  other than feeling really cheaply made it functions as it should",2020,11
"Very good mouse, excellent",2020,11
"I bought it for work. It's so smooth, color is a matte black. LED lights are so cool and fun. Doesn't make any clicking sound. Is rechargeable. I'm very happy with this purchase.",2020,11
"Very easy to use, really like the lighted keyboard. The price is great and it is very well made.",2022,11
"works as advertised, has good action and the lights are fun.",2022,11
I bought this as a gift so unfortunately it wasn’t opened until after the return window but it only worked for 1 day!!! LED background lights work 25% of the time and it will not charge. Save your time and money and do not buy this product!,2022,11
"Now, correct me if I'm wrong but a keyboard is meant to be used to type. I hooked this up to my rig and when I try to type anything literally nothing happens then like 40secs later the first letter of what I tried to type pops up, then nothing happens. If the description of this keyboard would've said ""light up keyboard for display use only"" then 5 out of 5 stars. Since it is advertised as a useful keyboard and a gaming keyboard at that I'd have to say don't buy it, buy literally anything else and maybe even 2 letters might get typed.",2022,11
This keyboard shipped quickly and is very easy to use. I love the colors in the backlighting. The customer service was also great. Highly recommend!,2022,11
"I use this keyboard with my gaming laptop - only when I'm not using my gaming desktop. The keyboard is quite nice and responsive, but the battery dies very fast. I use it maybe 30 mins a day, and it dies in a week. I would much rather have less backlighting and AA batteries I can swap out. I hate when it dies in the middle of a game and then I have to plug it in and wait while it charges.",2022,11
"I purchased this maybe 8-9 months ago, and it worked great. The battery life is really impressive, barely ever had to charge it and I am a pretty hardcore PC gamer. No noticeable latency, and it goes between sleep and active mode seamlessly. The full color RGB is a definite nice touch. Also, the keys have a nice soft press feel to them. Very quiet. If you are looking for a very pronounced mechanical keystroke, this is not that.Their customer service responds extremely fast, and was refreshing to have such helpful people respond to a message in the fashion they did. 10/10. Will order from again in the future.",2022,11
"I've had this wireless keyboard for almost a month. This is my first one, because my brother was the one that recommended this to me. I had get used to the backlit lights not being on all the time, but overall this is an excellent wireless keyboard, and I have not had an issue with it. It came undamaged. And it arrived quick. And the customer service at KLIM has excellent customer service.",2022,10
"I got this because it was cute and I needed soft keys or my girlfriend was going to lose her mind when we work from home together. It’s soft , quiet. Cute and easy function. I love it. Does die faster than I would like but it lights up. Of course it does.",2022,10
Great keyboard,2022,10
Lightweight wireless keyboard that lives up to its description.,2022,10
"I have seen some reviews on here saying that there is no way to turn off the lights, but you can. You have to press FN + the Pause Break button twice, and the lights will turn off.",2022,10
"So I needed a good quality wireless keyboard, but I was a little unsure any would meet my standards as I'm a techie and have a huge TV and distance to my couch where I was going to play PC games from. Just WOW. This thing has the responsiveness of a wired gaming keyboard, feels great to handle, and I use it at nearly 15 feet away to boot. It's actually better than some of my professional keyboards I use at nearly 5x the cost. Totally worth the buy, and the battery lasts ridiculously long.",2022,10
Good and simple to use,2022,10
It's quiet and esthetically pleasing!,2022,10
typing no longer sounds extremely loud or distracting!It is smooth and perfect for gaming as well!,2022,10
Sometimes the keys work when I click sometimes they don't. It get's really annoying.,2022,10
Excellent,2022,10
"I bought it in September 1 and didn’t receive it not until September 3. We are at October 5 end it already went out, not even a month. It started at the end of September with not keeping a charge so kept cord in and charged during the day while working on it then stopped working turned off and on, and just completely stopped.",2022,10
For my son's gaming and it's perfect,2022,10
Nice enough keyboard for the price but not really quiet which is one of the main reasons I purchased.,2022,10
"I loved this keyboard when I first started using it..... But that didn't last very long. I haven't even been using this keyboard for a full month yet and it quit working completely. Such a waste of time, completely useless for working from home. The usb stays plugged in all the time so I can use the wireless capability, but it just quit charging, I can press 1 key and then it completely dies, even if I plug in the usb cord it will light up but no matter what key i press it does absolutely nothing. I am returning this ASAP. Don't waste your time or money. Garbage",2022,10
 Paint text didn't last a full year as they explained. Keyboard keys started becoming loose to the point you have to click on it really hard to work,2022,10
"Have tried multiple charging cords and power sources, including the one they provide and the keyboard just won’t charge. When I first bought it I charged it up no problem. This is the first time the battery died and when trying to recharge it nothing happens.",2022,10
The keyboard works fine and the lights are pretty cool but the cable that connects it to the computer is not working. It doesn't fit anything USB-C  is like there's something stuck or damaged inside.,2022,10
"THE ON-OFF SWITCH IS ON THE BOTTOM OFTHE KEYBOARD.  YOU HAVE TO PICK IT UP AND FLIP IT OVER IT IS VERY SMALL AND IN AN INDENT, AND HARD TO MOVE.  GOING TO BE CHAGING IT A LOT.",2022,10
Love the colors!,2022,10
I just needed a new keyboard for work. but i wanted to pick a lightup keyboard just because ive replaced everything with the light up option. im sure you can do alot more with it but as far as what i needed it for its completely fine!! 5 stars,2022,10
"I honestly love this product. The keys are very comfortable to use and the ergonomics of the keyboard are conducive for gaming and typing. My keyboard did experience some issues with the left side shift key after about 2 years of heavy use so I reached out to customer support and was mailed a replacement in about 2 days after contacting them. The customer support team is extremely friendly and helpful. Overall, this is an excellent product and excellent company. I will absolutely purchase any PC hardware from Klim in the future.",2022,10
"This is a great wireless keyboard and it's really quiet, which I'm sure over time and use, the loud clicking will return. (That's what my other gaming keyboard did anyway.) It feels comfortable, it works great, and I'm enjoying it so far. Just wish the keyboard itself was a little bigger, but that's my fault for not checking the measurements.",2022,10
First one died within a week and a half bit the company was great about getting me a quick replacement,2022,10
Really good keyboard,2022,10
Just lays there like a squash. Pretty colors when you press on the keys. But the keys don't work. Keyboard that doesn't type. Done trying to get this thing to work. Just a basic run-of-the-mill piece of crap that has pretty lights.,2022,10
"I purchased this keyboard last year in November 2021 and have been very satisfied with it's performance. It is comfortable to type on and the different color backlighting is cool, but it would be better if the sleep mode didn't take effect so soon. This is an issue when in a dim room because it can be a bit difficult to see the opaque lettering before pressing on that first key to activate the lights.Additionally, recently the keyboard was only staying on if it was connected to the charging cable it came with, and last week, it began shutting off intermittently even while connected. That should have alerted me to the fact that it was a cable issue and not a battery issue, but it didn't and I contacted Klim's customer service. Lolita, the customer service agent, responded quickly and one of the suggestions given was to try a different cable. But she also reiterated that there was a 5-year warranty should none of the suggestions resolve the issue. Charging with a different cable that I already had in my possession worked and I am now utilizing the keyboard again without having to be connected.I am extremely happy with this product and their customer service and would not hesitate to order one of their other products should I need one in the future.",2022,10
Excellent product for the price.,2022,10
"The user was not expecting a rechargeable keyboard, and has been pleasantly surprised by this one. The bells and whistles haven't been a main draw [past the first day or two, fiddling with the colors]. Performance-wise, this keyboard has been standing up well to normal business use, and the recharge at night is not onerous - it's just one last thing to do before heading out for the day. No big deal.",2022,10
I have purchased two of these keyboards and both have extremely loud spacebars.  I have tried greasing the key among other things and it does not resolve the issue.  Other than that I like the keyboard.,2022,10
"I love colorful keyboards even though I'm not a gamer. When I purchased this one, I was thrilled to see how colorful it was, how handy it was to just charge it up and not struggle with a cord and find it has a long battery life. However, I have had consistent trouble with the layout of the keys. The biggest problem I have is the Enter key. When I'm typing, I'm constantly getting the ""\"" instead of the enter key. I thought I would get used to it, but I haven't for over a couple of months. Other keys are a little bit off what I expect, so I'm frequently making typos when using apostrophes, etc. I plan to keep it in reserve, but I've ordered a Logitech keyboard because I'm quite sure the keys will be in the places I expect for touch typing.",2022,09
I love the keyboard and mouse combo! They work great! And the company support team is amazing!  They helped me with my issues through email and they are fast and responding back quickly!,2022,09
I really like very helpful,2022,09
"Great feel, full size keyboard that is wireless and has blacklighting.  Bought this because several keys quit working on my laptop.  I don't really use this for gaming, but I love size and the feel of the keystrokes. It also has a built in battery, so you can just recharge instead of having to replace batteries all the time. Very happy with this purchase!",2022,09
When I hit the i key it types io.  When I hit the o key it types io. Should have gone with logitech.,2022,09
Light weight,2022,09
the keyboard is wireless but i find myself having to recharge the batteries 3-4 times a week. other keyboard that  those keyboard only  require charging once a week.,2022,09
"My precious gaming keyboard was nice and cute, but I wanted a full keyboard with lower keys. This keyboard gave me just what I needed. The keys are soft and smooth, low height, and quiet. Colors are nice too. Good price, good buy!",2022,09
Works great,2022,09
The keys feel great while typing! The reaction is fast!The RGB lights work great and look cool!Overall great product for the price!,2022,09
the keyboard  is light  as a  feather so you have to be very careful with it .. The RGB  lights do not blink.  it his 3  modes high med and off  the  2 things i like about it is... its Wireless  and i can get at last 4 days i do not type  much so this can be why lol ..it will go to sleep in 3 sec i was told its 60 sec i know it will good to sleep fast,2022,09
BATTERY ONLY GOOD FOR 5 MONTHS ONLY LASTS 2 hours now,2021,09
"I bought this keyboard. It worked great right out of the box for 5 minutes, then nothing. I thought maybe battery was dead. So I charged it for a while. It never turned on again. I thought, maybe it's the port, so I switched ports. Nothing. I thought maybe it's the driver, so I fixed that, still nothing. I thought it was the computer, so I funnily enough, bought a new one. It does not work. Nothing you do will make this work. This is a paper weight at most. Like, it feels nice to touch, it does nothing. It is just there to look nice. It is a mistake of a creation, and honestly, using the accessibility keyboard works better than this. I tested it. I went and played wow using accessibility keyboard, then I used this. Obviously, the accessibility keyboard was phenomenal in comparison, mainly because this one does not work. I would pay to not have this in my memory.",2022,09
This keyboard is amazing. While I wish the RHB was addressable I really cannot complain,2022,09
Really appreciate the customer service KLIM provides. Quick responses and excellent keyboard.,2022,09
"Charging indicator light stopped working after only a few days, so I could never tell if its actually charging or not....wasn't a huge deal because at least it still worked....BUT now that it's been like 8 months, I went to plug it in the other night, charged it all night, and it now wont even hold a charge. I can plug it in for hours, turn it on and the lights only stay on for a few seconds before the whole unit dies. Totally not happy that I now have to spend another $50-100 that I don't have on another keyboard.Like the saying goes, Buy it nice or buy it twice!",2022,09
"I got this keyboard because my computer is not under direct light, and at night, it's difficult or impossible to see what you're typing. I can use this in the dark and it only stays lit when in use, so it's not glowing all day long. The rainbow colors are pretty. I only wish it had a volume button. You can push FN(function) & F4, but I would have liked just and up/down/mute feature somewhere.",2022,09
Great keyboard. Easy on/off switch. Hooks up to Bluetooth easily. And the rainbow lights are lovely!,2022,09
"Overall I'm really happy with this purchase. The keys feel nice and are quiet. (Someone else's review said that the space bar is very loud, and while it is louder than the other keys it's not obnoxiously so.) The battery seems to keep it going for a very long time and still works while it's charging. My biggest issue (which is not actually a big deal) is that I could change the settings for the backlight time-out. The lights on the board go out after 60 seconds, I wish I could edit that so they stay on longer. Especially since the keys are really hard to see it's dark in the room and the light is off. Another small detail I wish this had included is that most gaming keyboards I've had in the past have a little nub on the W, in addition to the F and the J keys like all keyboards have. This doesn't and I find myself missing that.I also think it should be noted because I didn't see it anywhere when I was buying it, that the colors are in a  rainbow pattern (seen in the photo) and cannot be changed from that. I just assumed that could be changed but it doesn't seem like it can",2022,09
"Horrible keyboard. Not wireless, wired for light to work, then it turns off in 30 seconds, worst keyboard I have ever bought.I do not like a thing about it",2022,09
"This is a great keyboard and I like it. However I do wish there were more light effects than featured. The lights are as shown in the picture. They can be set to stay a solid color or to strobe on and off. You can adjust the brightness of the lights as well. As far as the lights what you see in the description picture is exactly what you get. Other than the lights you are able to hold down the function key and press other keys to control the volume of your computer and play, skip forward, skip backward, and stop play buttons. Theres a couple other hotkeys you can use but are useless to myself and likely everyone else under the age of 50-60.",2022,09
"So all in all for 30$ this thing is fine. The ""RGB"" is NOT actually RGB instead featuring the average RGB rainbow. Cannot customize the coloration, just the brightness and the pattern (pulse, breathing, something along those lines)All that said this is a fine budget option.Clicky Bois beware, this is NOT very tactile. I prefer it that way, but I know many dont",2022,09
"I purchased this keyboard in Nov. 2021 and have really loved it. It is quiet and well back-lit, and just fun to use because of how colorful it is. Sad to say it less than a year in, it will no longer hold a charge so it is only usable when plugged in. Still a good buy but just sad that it didn't last a year",2022,09
Pros: great battery life. Charged once and it lasted the week working 8+ hours a day. Backlight turns off quickly with no keystrokes to preserve battery. Easy to connect.Cons: the space bar button squeaks when pressed.,2022,09
"Ok, I admit it - I love the colors!!  Necessary?  Nope.  Super fun?  Yup!!  Just adds a little playfulness to my office desk.  Works great, comes with charging cord.  Charge lasts a long time!  Love it!!",2022,09
The price is right and it has a rechargeable battery if you want that wireless vibe or you can keep it connected.,2022,08
Stopped working less than a year after purchase. The lights come on then immediately turn off after turning the keyboard on and they keys won’t work.Reseated the receiver and moved to different ports with no success. Charging doesn’t work.,2022,08
"This was an awesome wireless keyboard then after charging it twice it would not charge on the third time. Thought I got a dud so I got a second one same thing happened. Wish they would charge because they where great keyboards. And, Yes they where on a surge protector. But as soon as they key board died and I put them on the charger no charging light. Tried a few outlets and keep it on over night and nothing.",2022,08
"I'm loving this wireless keyboard, awesome battery life and the keyboard n rat are rechargeable. Excellent quality and price. Definitely recommend this product.",2022,08
Does exactly what it's supposed to. Great product!,2022,08
"i love it iv had it for two years and it's great. I lowkey spilled coffee on it yesterday and the light and everything still works I've spilled multiple things on it and it's still good So it is granted waterproof 👌Also, I bought this cover for it to travel with and it fits perfectlyhttps://www.amazon.com/KuRoKo-Keyboard-Neoprene-Wireless-Storage/dp/B07Z2KG4WF/ref=sr_1_8?crid=2U1DU5JWN97KV&keywords=keyboard+sleeve&qid=1660829299&sprefix=keyboard+sl%2Caps%2C112&sr=8-8",2022,08
Works great I would recommend it to everyone.,2022,08
This is the 2nd keyboard that won't hold a charge.  The 1st one never did and the replacement unit lasted five weeks until it became an Amazon regret purchase.  Just beyond the return time.Avoid!,2022,08
This keyboard fit what I needed for my gaming chats! Its so awesome I bought one for a birthday gift for a friend. He loves it too!,2022,08
"really enjoying it.  no more batteries to change, just plug in to charge",2022,08
This keyboard is the best!  I purchased 3 of them for work and my son's schooling.,2022,08
It brought it a month ago and it has already stopped working.,2022,08
 Not sure what happened but I went to go use my computer and this is what I see. I don’t have food or drink by this computer nor does anyone else use it. I’m had this keyboard for a little over 2 years. Looks like something expanded inside it and burst the seem of the keyboard. Some keys don’t work.,2022,08
charge only lasts a short time. then stops typing. plug it in and stops typing when charged. tested on other systems and nothing changed,2022,08
"First, the keyboard is too dim, and you cannot change the LED colors ....Also, could someone on earth explain why you chose RED led as a color... and that makes night visibility bad",2022,08
"My KKIM keyboard was about two years old and it suddenly wouldn’t work. I contact KLIM via email seeking tech assistance and they promptly replied and offered several suggestions to potentially solve the pry. Unfortunately, none of these worked and they informed me that they would ship me a new keyboard.It arrived in two days and it has been working perfectly since received.KLIM’s service and commitment was outstanding and I will use their products whenever my needs can be met with a suitable KLIM product.J. Roark",2022,08
"Just what I needed, use this keyboard at the office as I prefer a keyboard with raised keys. Super responsive and works well.",2022,08
"This keyboard is a good, inexpensive wireless keyboard. The colors are nice and bright, with a button for adjusting the brightness. You can also turn the RGB off all together. The battery life is very good. I usually get around 3 days of battery life without ever turning it off and heavy use. It’s not a mechanical keyboard, so if you’re a purist I would stay away from it. But for normal life use, it’s great!",2022,08
Great product fast shipping AAAAA,2022,08
I really like this keyboard I haven't had to recharge it yet and after almost 2 weeks I have to say it's pretty nice,2022,08
Bought 2 of these in April 2022 BOTH DEAD. I purchased two of these for two computers. One died about 2 weeks ago. To me it seemed the battery wasn't holding a charge. I contacted KLM for product support. I sent three emails and heard nothing in return. KLIM product support s@cks no matter how fancy their webpage is.  I then grabbed the other one and started using it on my fulltime  PC and it died today.  The fact that one used daily and the other used half as much BOTH died within weeks of each other is very telling.  Two keyboards lasted 5 months. If this isn't the definition of junk I don't know what it.,2022,08
Huge lag from keyboard to computer. Will just stop working randomly. You have to smash the keys down to get them to register the key stroke if they even register it at all.,2022,08
"This keyboard is exactly what I was looking for! The backlight is outstanding as is the battery capacity. Absolutely no complaints, especially for the price.",2022,08
We use this in our gaming business and it seems to be doing a good job.,2022,08
Strong connection all month without a recharge.,2022,08
"3 months later my keyboard just stopped working as I was typing! I thought it needed to be charged but even after charging it would not turn on! after many attempts to get it going again, by turning it off and on, it would work bur for a few minutes and then go all dark and become unresponsive. I would have rated it high as it was excellent when it worked but now it is useless.",2022,08
Make my work environment more fun! Love the colors and easily rechargeable,2022,08
"Backlight stopped working after first day of use, the settings for the backlight do not work and customer support on their website has not responded.Keyboard works otherwise.",2022,08
I got this for my office because I like pretty things which it is. As far as gaming I can’t say,2022,08
"Since I live in the remote rainforest, I always keep backups of necessary items like keyboards. I bought this keyboard several months ago and stored it, in it's original packaging until I needed it. Two days ago my current keyboard malfunctioned so I got this one out of the box to use and the ""y"" key mostly doesn't work at all or it puts double or triple letters. I am now stuck for about a month until I can get a new one. VERY DISAPPOINTED.",2022,08
"I didnt like the dim features Im using a Razer keyboard now and its alot brighter than this aloso hated the feature where it would turn off after a few seconds interferred big time with my gaming and I cant see where this can be a gaming keyboard as such games as Skyrim and Fallout require you to make last minute decisions! As for a regular keyboard for regular things? its good, but gaming naw! Its a waste of money sorry guys! its a flop!",2022,08
"works for what i needed it to do, but would be nice as I work early in the mornings, background lights could be al little brighter make it easier to see the keys, the time out for sleep should be extended somewhat maybe a little longer. other than that does the job. feels good to type on .",2022,08
"Recently I’ve started using my gaming rig for work in cad and other programs, so a wireless keyboard was necessary. Obviously RGB adds 245Xp points to every key stroke so this one really caught my eye.It is so well built, the materials used and battery life are phenomenal. I purchased a mouse keyboard combo here in the Amazon before and it was honestly crap. Within the first 20 minutes the v and I key would randomly start typing and the right shift key did not work out of the box. But this one! The Klim keyboard is an awesome budget solution!!Take the time to read the material in the box, it’s clearly an awesome company that has put alot of effort into their product. Very very satisfied! Im a sucker for stickers and they really load you up. Great experience. Highly recommend.",2022,08
"I would not recommend this keyboard to anyone in a humid environment, after a few weeks or a single small water spill many of the keys start typing the desired letter with a number in front, at no control to the typer.",2022,08
"Randomly stopped working during my work day. The keyboard still lights up when you type but it's like my computer stopped recognizing it even after I plugged it in. I tried different things I found on the web to troubleshoot, but still can't type. When I went online I saw many many posts of users experiencing the same issue so based on that I would not recommend buying this.",2022,08
backlite goes off to fast need it to stay on for a few minutes,2022,07
It’s a fine keyboard for the amount I paid but it doesn’t work as well as some other wireless keyboards.The charge didn’t seem to hold too long for mine. I feel like I have to charge it often.I also needed it to be on my craft table which is not too far from my computer but the distance I can use it wirelessly is poor. I needed it to allow me to work farther from my computer but I couldn’t go as far as I wanted.,2022,07
"I love the touch, fell and back lighting of the keyborad, but some of the lettering on the keyborad wore off.",2022,07
Goes to sleep a little too soon. Nice quiet key strokes.,2022,07
Awesome for gaming! Love it!,2022,07
"Battery doesn't last and stopped working after 30days. Very disappointed. If I could return it, I would. Don't buy, not worth it.",2022,07
"I use this keyboard for work and my job involves typing 8-10 hours a day. I have showed it off to everyone :) it is very quiet, smooth and they keys are soft. Was definitely impressed. 11/10 Rating",2022,07
It's a great looking keyboard but when you are typing random keys just start repppppppppppppppeating.  I've tried making corrections in my computer's setting window but nothing works.I tossed the original box it came with so I'm stuck with it now.  But beware this product.,2022,07
Was not disappointed.,2022,07
"Title says it all, one of the shift keys and the caps lock stopped working after only 3 months. Don’t bother.",2022,07
EDIT: customer service was very responsive. They walked me through resetting it. They said if it didn't work that I would covered under warranty. Luckily it was a quick and easy fix!the keyboard worked great for a month. Then it stopped working. It won't work and it won't charge.,2022,07
"This Keyboard is really light wait, quality is top notch, you can type for hours without getting tired. Good Gaming Keyboard as well. Good company with good quality products. Highly recommended KLIM products.",2022,07
"I like this keyboard overall, especially how low profile the buttons are, which i prefer, but the keyboard lights go to sleep Way too fast, and then you have a dark keyboard.",2022,07
The keyboard lights up beautifully.  It just never works with the computer.Complete waste of money.,2022,07
"I was not able to use, product missing USB.",2022,07
this keyboard is very good and the best part is their Excellent costumer service.,2022,07
My daughter love it was a birthday gift,2022,07
Good keyboard with nice easy touch keys.,2022,07
My keyboard is under the desk on holder where it’s dark and I can’t stop or change sleep mode time. Would like to change to always on at times.  Any advice if this is possible would be great. Otherwise very quiet and nice keyboard.,2022,07
Love the lighted background.  Makes finding keys in low or no light situation wonderful.  Price was good to for quality of product,2022,07
"The keyboard does say wireless but if I do not have it plugged into the usb port, it will not work. They replaced it immediately with a keyboard that works correctly,, Thank you.",2022,07
"I especially dislike the fact that the rgb turns itself off after a minute or so of no use. I purchased this keyboard because the one I had did that. If your playing a game and using a mouse or game controller, then you don't need the key oard much but when you do, you can't see which button is which until you strike a key and activate the lighting! What's the point in rgb lights if they don't just stay on? I guess I'll be buying a third keyboard, but this time I'll make sure it isn't practically useless to me. Probably go Newegg!",2022,07
"Excellent keyboard.  Perfect size, great lighting, comfortable quiet keys.  Rechargeable but it does lasts awhile before you need to recharge it.  Good quality build, a very very good wireless keyboard.",2022,04
When I ordered my keyboard for my boyfriend the charging piece wasn’t in the box so I messaged customer service and they sent me a new one within a couple days. Once I used the keyboard it was nice quality the keys were smooth and satisfying to press it connected very easily to the pc. Definitely if you want a keyboard buy this,2022,07
"Love Everything About ,Loves How Lights Turns off when not in used and turns On When you start Typing",2022,07
"I work from home and purchased this keyboard for my work computer. I prefer the backlit keys for work and usually the letters don’t wear off as quickly. This worked great for about 2-3 weeks and then it was no longer a quiet keyboard, my kids complain about how loud it is even 2 rooms away and it misses keys when I type, or double types a letter when I pushed it once. So if you like purchasing something that works for 2 weeks and then sucks, this is the keyboard for you. Otherwise keep shopping lol",2022,07
It works and it's nice but the led are quite dim.,2022,07
Its amazing!,2022,07
The keyboard won’t connect. I’ve tried to MANY times. I’ve contacted Amazon Support with no assistance. Save yourself the pain and get something else.,2022,07
Love it,2022,07
I actually use this for working from home and it actually makes your day more interesting seeing the pretty colors.,2022,07
"So I got this to replace my drab old keyboard and I'm glad I did. The fact that it's rechargeable was a big sell for me! And the very light texture feel nice to touch. The only problem (though not a game changer for me) I'm having is that the main ENTER button feels further away (or maybe it's smaller?) than what I'm used to.But overall, it's a thumbs up!",2022,06
" It just came in the keyboard is exactly what they said it's pretty quiet, led feature, well packaged.  Shout out to Amazon driver for delivering my package safely I recommend this product to everyone.",2022,06
excellent keyboard,2022,06
The dongle was so hard to get out that when I did pry it free from the tape it shot across the room never to be seen again.  I now have a piece of plastic I can charge and need to order a working keyboard.,2022,06
"left control key doesnt work for some use cases for whatever reason so it's annoying to have to use the right control key, also no FN lock.  Long story short, looks good but crappy functionality, pick another keyboard",2022,06
"Only had the item for a bit over a month and started having issues with the keyword would not working.  I would plug it in to charge and it wouldworks for awhile then start having issues,  would not type.  I would pull the USB connector out of my computer and put back in and it would work for a short time.  I dealt with this for a couple of days but then no longer could tolerate the keyboard not working.  Went out and bought me a different keyboard.  I work from home and have to have a reliable keyboard.",2022,06
"I have had this keyboard for well over a month now, it is cordless and rechargeable. The great thing about it is that when the battery needs a charge, I can plug it in with the supplied USB cord and still use the keyboard while it is charging. the keys are backlit with the light coming through each keys letter not just around them, the lights turn off after a short time of non-use but light back up with the tap of any key. I would buy this again without hesitation if needed.",2022,06
"I have been looking for a wireless keyboard with back light and came across this one.  I am really enjoying it, No I am not a gamer, I am using this for work, I like the lights on the keyboard, it's really light weight and it does not take up a lot of space. The only issue is one of the Shift key is loose, but it's not that bad to a point where it needs to be returned for me that's just my opinion. The keyboard only lights up when it's in use then after a few minutes it goes into sleep mode and that's not a issue for me.",2022,06
"Seems to me that the left CTRL + SHIFT issue has been resolved. I can go into Adobe Illustrator and press CTRL+SHIFT V and it will copy and paste in place for me. That's all I really use it for.Lighting: Isn't too bright but has a nice ambiance to it. No adjustment like their mouse. Their mouse as a driver which can control more, wish the keyboard had that.Keys: I had a slim keyboard before and I like playing on that a little bit more. Keys are fairly quiet. The keys are also taller so my fingers need to get used to it a bit more.Bluetooth Connectivity: Seems to be working good, didn't have any input lag",2022,06
I like everything about it,2022,06
Packaging was terrible and the corner was broken where it plugs in to charge. Still work great though and the lighting is really vibrant.,2022,06
"set back light to high, but I wish would be brighter.",2022,06
"I got this for my son for christmas last year.  He's used it with his Xbox and computer.  In typical kid fashion, he lost the USB dongle.  I contacted their customer service and they sent a new one at no charge!",2022,06
"I use it for work (time keeping) and it does everything I need it to: light for caps lock, ease of inputting shortcuts, comfortable for typing since it has two stands in the back, lights up so I can see the keys when I don't feel like turning on the lights in my office. Great product",2022,06
Good lighting on the keys for typing in low lighting. Comfortable typing. Perfect keyboard size not huge but not tiny either. I wish there was a way to but batteries in it in case the internal rechargeable battery ever goes out. It does come with a cable for charging. Overall very good keyboard happy with it so far. 👍,2022,06
it double types and disconnects all the time.,2022,06
Likes an older charger but it's great.,2022,06
Good pricing for what they offer.  Extremely happy with this keyboard.,2022,04
"I often - as we all do - use my laptop in less than bright conditions and prefer a keyboard that flashes along with my typing.This one was purchased for when I'm up at our cabin. I had received it in March, took it up then hadn't used it again until recently in June when I went back up. I was typing away and caught that the letter z wasn't working. Since I have one of those in my name it's sorta important. I pulled out the information in the little black envelope that came with the keyboard and found it to be entertaining.I sent a message to Contact Us and Vincent replied. He's the man with the hats. ;-)All is well, my replacement flashes, the Z and the 5 (discovered that afterwards) all are present now. The new one also has fully lit characters which led me to realize that they all were only half-lit with the first keyboard.I highly recommend this keyboard and KLIM Technologies!",2022,06
"I am not using the keyboard for gaming.  I use it for everyday use of my personal computer.  I love how it lights up so I can see the keys without turning on the light in my office as an option.  The keys fell easy to press down on, and it just feels comfortable to use.After 4 years I also had an issue with one of the keys cracking and was very pleased that KLIM Replaced the keyboard per their warranty.  Thank you very much to them.",2022,06
Bought this to go with my pc back in March. After about 4 months some of the keys lag out or do not function at all.,2022,06
So good!,2022,06
"Not very good honestly. It doesn't get very bright and there is on 2 different light modes. Most of the keys are only half lit and is hard to see during the day. All in all, I'm not impressed with it. I will be returning it. Not worth the money",2022,06
"This company is the best. Their products are all amazing, especially this keyboard. If anything goes wrong, they will quickly send you a replacement. They fully stand by their products. Best company ever!",2022,06
Item as described. Used for a kids computer.,2022,06
Love it,2022,06
"Ok...the good...Small company. I like supporting that.  Great packaging.  They have an insert that tells you about the team that designed the keyboard. The construction is solid, doesn't feel like junk.  Well made.What....could be better....The brightness of the colors in the photo is not what you are going to see in the product.  You can SEE the colors, but it's not very bright.  This is simply a light behind the keys, but considering it's connected to your computer, it should be brighter because it has continuous power source.What....is....jeez...not good.The key placement.  It's ""off"".  I understand that anytime you get a new keyboard that your fingers have to learn where the keys are.  But as large as this keyboard is...it should be spaced just a little bit better to a standardized keyboard.  The return is WAY off.  I am keeping it because it matches my mouse and it's pretty.  I know my fingers will eventually learn to reach (yes, reach) for the return.  But right now it...sorry...just blows.The product has potential to be SUPER AMAZING and I have no doubt they have a production crew willing to get it there which is exactly why I took the time to write an honest and detailed review.",2022,06
Wanted to like this since it was cheaper for a wireless keyboard with backlighting. With in a month or 2 of normal use the letters and numbers wore off. That I could live with but then the one of the shift keys broke in half and made this unusable. Again this was with normal office use no gaming no smashing keys.,2022,06
Don't walk Run from this keyboard and company. They say there is a 5 year warranty but there is not. Keyboard will stop working less than 6 months from purchase,2022,06
"Looks pretty but not very responsive. I use it at work and have to back up and re-read everything I type as it misses letters, adds extras if you even brush them with your finger, which is the only time it works really well, and I spend way more time than I should proof-reading to make sure the keyboard isn't making look like I can't type.",2022,06
"bought this to get rid of wires on my desk and it has been great. but the battery doesn't last as long as I expected, and that's with the backlights turned off. I was also disappointed to find that not all USB-c cables work to charge it. I lost the cable that comes with the keyboard to charge it and when it died only one of my 7 USB-c cables would charge it and I found that really strange. not totally sure why that is but it's something that I noticed. so if you don't have a lot of USB-c cables, don't lose the one that comes with it otherwise you might not be able to charge it.otherwise, I like it, haven't had any problems other than what is mentioned.",2022,06
"NOT FOR TOUCH TYPING/KEYBOARDING:  Backstory--I bought two of these -- one I use in my classroom so when I'm in the front of my room I can type urls or hit the escape button.  I love that it is back-lit as I often have lights off in my room during presentations or videos.  HOWEVER -- I bought a second one for home and CANNOT type on it.  I am old-school and learned touch-typing, and do so at a very fast pace.  But this keyboard HAS AN EXTRA KEY between the letter L and the Enter key.  Therefore I hit that key instead of the enter key every time -- very frustrating.  Quickly returned it as it is useless to me.",2022,06
"The multi color lights where handy but, my eyes could not adjust to the colors.",2022,06
"I been using for almost 9~10month now.I spilled water...and it said water proof but when I press key, multiple and wrong letter types.I try to fix it by dissembling but was not able to fix it....it is not water proof so careful.",2022,05
"Dig it, love it, still can't adjust my fingers so that I'm not pressing the ""\"" key when I want to hit enter because my hands are trained on a wider keyboard.\Oop did it again.",2022,05
Product has ceased working after 2 years. It doesn’t seem to take charge anymore. Disappointing.,2022,05
Excellent,2022,05
"Enjoying my new keyboard, very sturdy and connected well with my devices.",2022,03
"Some stuff is okay to cheap out on, but I wouldn’t recommend it with this keyboard. It worked just fine until it completely stopped holding a charge after only 2 months of use. If you really want a sweet, light up key board, I’d bite the bullet and spend the money for a legit one. Don’t waste your time or money.",2022,05
"I bought this keyboard for my Software Engineering job and it is great for emails, programming, etc. Its also great for gaming as well. Highly recommend this product. Also, great customer service!",2022,05
M’y daughter loves it!,2022,05
I'm glad after all the different choices of keyboards and all the different features I believe I choose the right one for me.,2022,05
"My grandson had trouble with his Wireless Keyboard which was a Christmas gift.  He told me of the trouble and I said I would contact Klim Customer service. I suspected it was a dongle problem and I emailed them and got a response back in 2 hours from a Service rep named Lolita. She instructed me what to do to identify my Amazon order number and I emailed it back to her.  5 hours later I got a response with instructions on trouble shooting the problem. It did in fact turn out to be the dongle.  I emailed back our findings and almost immediately got a response from Lolita that she was shipping a complete new keyboard and dongle.  Her reason was ""in case it wasn't the dongle she did not want to disappoint my grandson  by having to wait for additional resolution"".2 days later I received the new keyboard and all is well.I believe the Customer Service is in the UK.  Considering the time difference I found this to be amazing service.Thank you Lolita.  Their products are great but their service was unbelievable!!",2022,05
"After 2-3 years I had a problem with the charging of my keyboard. I emailed KLIM, they verified the issue and sent me a new keyboard. Fantastic.",2022,05
I have only had it for a few months and some of the keys aren't as responsive as they should be.I don't think it is worth the money.It is not at all ergonomic.,2022,05
Great value for the money letters on keyboard rub off after a few months,2022,04
 The keyboard is fantastic,2022,04
stopped working after 2 months.  update KLIM contacted me we got it working I love my lighted keyboard,2022,04
My son loved it !,2022,04
"I'm in the process of trying to find a replacement keyboard for the logitech k800, and this ain't it either. I tried another keyboard before this one and it didn't cut it at all. The illumination on this KLIM is worse than the Deluxe I tried first. With the brightness turned all the way up and the keyboard freshly charged it is very dim and hard to read, especially all around the outside edge of the keys/keyboard. Another minus is that every time you stop typing it turns off (the illumination). Yes it does come back on when you start typing but when you can't see which keys are which it's hard to find the correct key to press without messing up your work. It is also a fairly small keyboard, a little bigger than the Deluxe but not much. Once again the old adage, 'you get what you pay for' comes into play. Still looking.",2022,04
Works well,2022,04
Stopped working after a few weeks.,2022,04
"This product is perfect. I am just using it as a regular keyboard for my laptop but my gaming buddy immediately picked it up and was checking it out. He seemed impressed with it and that was enough to have me sold on it! The lights are great, the keys feel perfect for typing as far as spacing goes. The wireless is a nice touch as well. Excited for years of use to come from this thing.",2022,04
"For the price of the keyboard....The quality is outstanding. Great feel, built well, looks nice, overall 10/10. Came in a nice sleek package with stickers (as do all their products).All i can say is get yourself one and check it out yourself. Now for gaming it does great, but if your serious tournament status then obviously you'll need a wired keyboard. Other than that any games you enjoy  playing will do fine. I personally play GTA V RP and I've had no problems works flawlessly.All my FPS have no issues either. I can move around and keys work in sync just fine. Multiple keys at once works. All around great.I have a mouse as well and same thing 10/10. If your hesitant due to to the pricing. Don't be, you'll be happy and glad you made the purchase.I was skeptical myself and wasn't expecting the quality to be that great. I took the chance and am glad I did. I'll be purchasing more of their products moving forward!",2022,04
This keyboard is worthless! It only lasted 2 months before it started cutting in and out. It takes me 5 minutes to type one word because this keyboard cuts in and out. It's so frustrating trying to use this junk keyboard! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,2022,04
I use this at work. It's great. Everyone asks me about my keyboard all the time. I have ADHD and it actually helps me focus.,2022,04
"I like the keyboard for all of its features except for one: The enter key. It's difficult to touch-type due to the weird shape of the key. I keep hitting the backslash key when I really want to hit the enter key. Normally the backslash key would be located on the end and right above the enter key. This won't be a problem for those who don't touch type but for those of us who do, it's an impossible reach when trying to fly at 85 words per minute. For this reason I don't recommend this particular keyboard. I'm going to be looking for a new keyboard.",2022,04
"Lights are very dim and cut off after 30 seconds. No way to change it. This wouldn't be a problem per se but the letters on the keyboard are very dark white. Even with the lights in the room on they are hard to see until you press a button to get the backlight on. So if you use your keyboard in a darkish room - this is a hard pass. I don't have to look at my keyboard to type, but if I have let the backlight go out while I think about something else and my hands leave the keyboard ....I have to spend a few seconds orientating my hands at the correct spot. This is a real pain. Also not as quiet as they make it sound. I've had cheaper non-name wired keyboards that were almost completely silent.",2022,04
"First off, this keyboard has been nice to type on considering the price. At first, the keys were a bit too soft and required slightly more pressure to press, but as I typed more on it, they loosened up and now feel great. The keys feel ""clicky"", but soft enough where it's not loud to type. The space bar is a bit louder, but not as loud compared to other keyboards. Works great as an external keyboard for my Windows and Mac laptops.I do wish the max brightness of the keys was higher as it's not as bright when the room light is on. Also, it would be nice to have the option to change the colors of the lights like other keyboards that are around the same price range, or cheaper. Lastly, it would be slightly less annoying to have the option to use the media keys without needing to press the FN key.For Macs:On my 2015 MacBook Pro with Mojave, I was able to change the settings to where the Ctrl key functions as the Command key on a Mac. You simply go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys... and ensure that the correct keyboard is selected on the top next to ""Select keyboard:"". For me, it was 2.4G Wireless Receiver. Once the correct keyboard is selected, I changed the Control Key: to Command and changed the Command Key: to Control. Now, the Ctrl key functions as the Command key.However, the Windows key functions as the Command key by default, so these steps are not necessary if you're okay using the Windows key.Overall, I would recommend it if you're on a budget and don't mind some of the drawbacks I mentioned. Still a great keyboard and battery life is pretty good.",2022,04
Carry it in a backpack at work. Field applications 5 days a week.  It’s hard core. Certainly can take a beating.,2022,04
"Ordered a specific bluetooth 65% keyboard based on a YouTube review.  This one came up but didn't show the name.  It looked like the one search but it's a cheap, dongle only, full sized keyboard.  Misleading advertising!",2022,04
"While this keyboard is good, it not silent like the description says. Also, the shape of the enter key is awkward and I don't like it.But that is from a personal perspective on a like / dislike for the shape. It by no means takes away from the effectiveness of the keyboard.I will be looking for another one similar to this one (maybe even the same brand)",2022,04
Its only been a couple of months since I started using this keyboard but I am not able to use it when it is plugged in for charging anymore. This is really annoying as I have to switch to different keyboard when this one dies. Not a very reliable product.,2022,04
"This is my third Klim keyboard. Loved the first 2, they changed something on the design because the space bar is terrible now—doesn’t work if off-center at all!",2022,04
I use it for every day work. It's great,2022,04
I like this keyboard because it is quiet when you type on it and the backlit colors make it more enjoyable. Worth the money I spent on it.,2022,04
"Bought it on August 11th, and it died April 8th. It was a good keyboard up till now. Not one problem. Then this morning, it just quit, &, Yes its charged.",2022,04
Great keyboard. Wish it was brighter. Big. Doesn’t have the same shortcuts another keyboard I had (laptop wise). But good.,2022,04
"I like the feel of this keyboard. The back lighting works well. It's a solid keyboard. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the back slash key is next to the enter key. All my other keyboard have it above the enter key. I frequently hit the backslash when intending to press enter. I'll get use to it, and would probably them give this 5 stars after I do.",2022,04
"Lights up, I like the wireless thing going on, quiet keys which I like",2022,03

great keyboard for room with low lighting,2022,03
"Depending on what you want/like in a gaming keyboard, this keyboard fits in well. My husband loves it and I have seen an improvement in his gaming. It also has a nice authestic with the lights. The lights do not get crazy bright but are bright enough to notice and creates an atmosphere.",2022,03
"It was initially a pretty decent keyboard, but after a few months things started going wrongThe spacebar started sticking in the pressed state and after about a year, it stopped recharging and it keeps turning off and on with every key pressPrice is in par with quality I guess?A disappointment nonetheless",2022,03
"KLIM Chroma Rechargeable Keyboard is great.  I don't use it for gaming so I cannot address that, but for regular typing and daily usage, it can't be beat.  Had a defective key and I contacted KLIM.  Their customer care was superior and they truly value their customers.  A replacement was promptly sent after a few questions.  I highly recommend KLIM for  not only their products, but for a company that stands behind their products and that values their customers.

"I bought this keyboard about a year ago initially. The light up feature is very cool and made my work from home months more enjoyable. At one point when rearranging my office space I lost the wireless receiver. I was very disappointed because it had been working great, so I reached out to the company directly to see if I could buy a new receiver as the keyboard was still working fine. They told me the wireless receiver was on backorder but they would replace it for free! I was very pleased with that solution. However, a few months went by and they told me they wouldn't be able to get me a replacement part. So they sent me a brand new keyboard! I highly recommend this product and this company.",2022,03
It's a great keyboard. Keys are a little difficult to press sometimes (more like a typewriter). Overall I do like the keyboard,2022,02
I ordered one to try out.. it kept disconnecting if I didn't press a key for 10 seconds... Won't hold a charge at all... So I requested a replacement... It came and same deal.. just disconnects middle of using it...needless to say I now have 2 useless wireless keyboards in my house.,2022,03
"I bought this in 2021 and it has been a very big disappointment. It has constant connection issues, today I finally gave up and I am ready to throw this thing in the trash where it belongs.Do yourself a favor and go with a keyboard that can connect without issues more than 2 ft away.",2022,03
Loving this Keyboard it latest days to hour charged up. My family gamers so this keyboard been awesome on keeping up with amount use it. And the charge too. Totally recommend it and buy it again,2022,03
It was working fine until one day it would not connect to my computer. I reached out to support and they were able to send me a new one without a question. They provided the perfect support in the time frame I needed.,2022,03
This works great for gaming and normal PC games. Check out our YouTube channel Northwoods Peach Tree,2022,03
Had a issue with a keyboard I purchased for my granddaughter.  KLIM customer service reps went totally out of their way to fix the problem.  Above and beyond.  I can tell you for a fact that if you need any help KLIM customer service won't jerk you around.  Totally impressed.  Will definitely purchase from them again!,2022,03
"this is the bang for your buck. but before you get too wild about it, there are some things you should note.1. after some use, the keyboard gets a little squeaky.2. i dont know if i got a defective product, but for me, whenever i was trying to press '2' while holding spacebar, the 2 would not register, leaving me stuck with another inventory/slot. this makes it really bad for action games, because if you were to switch to the second slot, you would have to let go of spacebar.if those things dont bother you, buy this keyboard. its amazing.",2022,03
"bought it after going through many ""water proof"" keyboards.

Out of working in three months,2022,03

I have a ton of keyboards and this thing would be perfect if it was wireless but it's wired so it's almost perfect! I like it really a lot.,2022,03

"So, there is no way to turn off the sleep mode.The point of a lit keyboard was to see the keys. After sixty seconds, the light turns off, and I have to hit a random key to get the light on.  That makes the entire purchase a waste.I asked for a lit keyboard because I needed a keyboard that would be lit.  This is not lit for more than a minute at a time.  It's an unlit lit keyboard.",2022,03
I wish there was a way to tell how low the battery is getting. I can typically get a full week of roughly a 9-5 work day but sometimes it will die all of a sudden and then require several hours charge.,2022,03
I bought this for my 7 year old and he loved it. Very easy to use and it automatically goes in sleep mode if you forget to turn it off. We have had it and used it for months and haven’t had to charge it yet!,2022,03
"Ergonomically, it's nice.  A little clickier than I expected.  The lights aren't as bright as I expected and the charge seems to be not very long.  I had it unplugged for about an hour, and I'm not constantly typing, and I just had to plug it in as it seemed to be not registering keystrokes...I feel I paid way too much",2022,03
It didn’t last long. Had to purchase another keyboard for my grandson ( another brand) as this one only lasted 2months,2022,03
Liked the size and curved screen. Easy on the eyes.,2022,03
"If you just need a wireless keyboard it is as decent as any other - no complaints in terms of typing.. The back-lit function however is very weak.. the brightest setting really does not brighten the key lettering so you can see in a darkened room what you're typing..  The backlit is just very nice-looking dressing that brightens under the keys and constantly shuts off so you have to click something then undo before u can type with the fancy light.. On a practical level, the back-light is really useless.. Just nice to look at.. nothing more",2022,03
I'm not a PC gamer but I spend a lot of time on my personal PC during the day. I wanted something inexpensive with backlit keyboard and a number pad and this fits the bill. The keys do make an audible click so it's not silent.I really like the value of this keyboard and the design.,2022,03
Cheap product. Did not last long and wireless connectivity is horrible,2022,03
"I ordered this keyboard a few months ago and absolutely love it.I mainly use my keyboard for school and casual gaming. It charges quickly and lasts a very long time, the connectivity was simple and consistent, and the quality was just as good if not BETTER than my boyfriends Corsair keyboard that is nearly four times the price. They keyboard itself has a great feel to it - The keys are not too loud, and it does not have that ""cheap hollow plastic"" feeling like most budget gaming keyboards do.What makes this product even better is the excellent company behind it. A few weeks ago my dongle stopped working (highly likely it was a user-error, I commute with my laptop quite a bit and tend to forget to remove my dongle). I reached out to their incredibly friendly customer service and after some troubleshooting and confirming it was not a software problem, they promised to send me out a new dongle once they got back in stock.  A week or two went by, and just when I thought maybe I was out of luck, I received an email from Lolita informing me that since their replacement dongles were still out of stock, they would be shipping me a brand new keyboard! I had the new keyboard at my doorstep in two days, just in time for my online mid-term. In my experience, most tech companies completely forget about their customers or blow them off when it comes to little things like this.I already loved my KLIM keyboard, but we are now officially a ""KLIM household"".  I highly recommend buying their products.",2022,02
"This keyboard was fine, for larger hands than mine! Before buying, notice the position of the Enter key. I could not reach it with my pinkie without moving my hand away from the home position.",2022,02
excellent,2022,02
"Great keyboard for the price. I love the feel, though somehow I do feel it isn't as ""hefty"" when typing than I'm used to. Some people might like this light feel. I prefer heavier response when I click. Work from home coder, so I use it on average minimum 5hours daily. It's lasted approx 20 days on a single charge, not bad at all, if you charge it overnight once a week, you shouldn't have any problems with it dying randomly. The auto sleep feature is nice to prolong the battery, but when I'm working it can be a like off putting that the lights go out, vs them constantly being on.",2022,02
"They moved the back slash (\) and Pipe command key down next to the (""') key and made the enter key taller. I keep hitting the \ key instead of the enter key.",2022,02
" This was a pretty good buy, and it’s actually better than I thought. It’s pretty quiet when typing and very smooth. I love how it goes to sleep mode after a few seconds. The lights on the keyboard are nice and vibrant. Much better than I thought it would be. Comes with a usb to C cord for lightning fast charging. Only charged it once on Friday and it’s still going. We’ll see how long the keyboard’s power will last. Will definitely keep you guys posted. Other than that, no complaints so far!",2022,02
"This keyboard is decent. It types well, has a good tactile response, and an easy to adjust-to layout.  In addition, the RGB backlight works great and looks good. Minor Flaw 1: The flip-out legs to prop the keyboard to a more ergonomic position tend to close easily from the pressure of typing or gaming. Minor Flaw 2: If you type all day and game all night, this is not the keyboard for you since the battery life when subjected to all-day activity is relatively short. I have to charge the keyboard literally five times as often as my wireless mouse of a different brand. Major Flaw:  Given that battery life is not where I would like it to be, the biggest problem with this keyboard is that there is absolutely no warning that the battery on the keyboard is low. You are typing or gaming and the keyboard suddenly becomes non-responsive because the battery is suddenly dead. Of course, quickly resolved by plugging in the charging cord, but incredibly annoying and inconvenient. Overall, a decent keyboard, but not having any type of warning that the battery is almost dead is really annoying since having to stop and plug it in often causes the loss of train of thought when working or the death of my avatar when gaming. Pretty lights, though.",2022,02
The worst keyboard Iver ever had to use came from Amazon. Wow Im shocked.,2022,02
"Then, were kidding when they said this was a quiet keyboard.  After using it for less than 60 days the keyboard squeezes on several keys when I push it including the space bar.  It is very annoying so I plan on trashing it since it is past the return date. I purchased this keyboard because I wanted a light-up keyboard.  I use it for work. Too much noise!",2022,02
"UPDATE:  After six months the keyboard has died. Won't hold a charge any more. My whole experience with this thing has been negative and I would strongly recommend against buying one. (Even if it is $10 cheaper than when I bought it.)Original review, when I gave it three stars:  I bought this primarily because I wanted a wireless backlit keyboard. And this one lights up well. Only it goes off after only about a minute and leaves me in the dark. You of course only have to punch a key to bring the lights back, but it still interrupts my whole process when I'm working. It has a  nice touch, which was why I bought a gaming keyboard even though I don't play games, and I would otherwise like the keyboard. But this feature leaves me contemplating buying a different brand. Drives me crazy.",2022,02
 I tried everything i contacted the support through the website and no response since Feb 6th after the day i got the item (its the 9th rn of Feb) and so i waited a little longer for a response but nothing and so I tried to connect the cord to the item... Again nothing and the usb as you can see in the video is connect to my computer and i tried connecting it to other ports in the computer but nothing else work i also tried with the charging cable to see if that would work but nothing again :/ so i am disappointed in the product,2022,02
"I picked this up because I was looking for a QUIET wireless keyboard.  The reviews and product information said this was the one for me, but it's disappointing.  The keys are quiet, but the space bar is so loud and rickety that it more than makes up for the quiet keys.  And since I'm using this to type all day and not game, the space bar gets hit a lot.  I'll deal with it, and the other features of the keyboard are fine, but this is a disappointment to me.",2022,01
Home computer use not gaming.,2022,01
It a great keyboard with a great battery life. Well built. And perfect for the casual gamer. It hooked right up to my xbox.,2021,09
"I'm kind of unsure how this has so many great reviews. I'm on my second in only 6 months. sometimes the keys randomly stop working or things like the scroll lock just randomly turn on when you have never touched it. on mine, the sicker where it tells you if the caps and num lock are activated is already starting to pull off. Again this is only after 3 months, I do use it daily but that really shouldn't matter.Also, the space bar is super loud and inconsistent.But if you are like me your would rather troubleshoot something instead of wasting something and just throwing it out. Tried contacting the company, but that's literally nonexistent - Amazon just kept giving me to the wrong site and there's not a number or email. you go to contact them from amazon and they bring you to a winter outerwear site...those clearly aren't the same companies. Would have loved some help instead of throwing this thing in the trash, trying not to be wasteful here.The battery will die randomly with no warning. super inconvenient when you're just trying to work.",2022,01
"This keyboard may look cool, but that's about it.  The keys are not button-like, like the one brand I normally use, so typing with average size nails is difficult.  It makes way too much noice for my comfort.  I am returning the product because it doesn't meet my expectations.",2022,01
"I ordered this keyboard and used it for about 2 weeks and then it just stops working. I would charge it for hours and it just won’t turn on. It would turn on for like 10 minutes and then immediately shuts off. Then, I emailed Amazon and got a replacement. The replacement stopped working 4 days in…..AND IT IS THE SAME ISSUE! It just somehow turns off and then I would charge it and it just won’t stay on for more than 10 mins. I’m returning BOTH NOW AND THATS IT.",2022,01
Love the response time on the keys and how quiet it is,2022,01
Product was as described.  Lighted keys assists with night gaming and work.,2022,01
Cute little plug and play usb keyboard.,2022,01
"Unfortunately, the keyboard came out of the box not holding a charge. A few weeks of office work later the ""l"" key stopped working properly.  I tossed the box so I am S.O.L on returning it.  Here shopping for a new one and only had it for about a month.",2022,01
Grandson loves it. He has no complaints and uses it with his xbox.,2022,01
I used this keyboard for remote work. After 3 months of having it. The letter “K” went out…other than that it worked great!,2022,01
"Ctrl-Shift-N (left) doesn't work, I have to use Ctrl-Shift-N (right), it is not the end of the world but it is annoying. Depending on the game you'll play some key combinations may not work also. I tried to use this for Flight Simulations which needs lots of key combinations, failed. Even within less than 6ft from directly visible usb dongle this product misses characters while typing.Sleep mode and battery life is good, but overall I'm regretting my decision to buy this product.",2022,01
"JUST EXCELLENT ALL ROUND, ATTRACTIVE, NICE KEY TOUCH ACNT FAULT IT. USE FOR GAMING AND VIDEO EDITING .. GREAT  PRODUCT 10/10",2022,01
"Not using this keyboard for gaming,  just liked the colors and wanted a wireless keyboard that fit my desk. Everything works so far, I'm happy.",2022,01
"Keyboard works okay, except the S key continues to get stuck as soon as I started using it and needs to be picked at to lift it back into place and messes up my work a lot. The space bar is much louder than the rest of the keys which is more of an annoyance than anything.",2022,01
The only thing I don't like about this keyboard is that there's a faint humming sound when the backlights come on. Other than that it's a great sturdy wireless keyboard.,2022,01
You can’t beat it for the price,2022,01
"Love the keyboard, everything about it. It was a great purchase!",2022,01
"It's great. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the lights go off almost as soon as you stop typing. I understand that it has an energy saver to keep you from constantly recharging it, but 60 seconds would have been perfect. You barely can enjoy the effects. As far as being loud, it's not loud to me. I don't what kind of silent vortex these other people need to be in, but it's a quiet enough keyboard.",2022,01
"Control+Shift+N doesn't work. I saw this in other older reviews, but this was supposed to be a new 2022 version of the keyboard so hoped it was fixed. Nope. Before all the other features, backlighting, ergonomics etc, a keyboard needs to allow you to press keys and have those keys go to the computer. I use this combo constantly for work to login to sites as different users or without cookies.Not taking what I type and send it to the computer is a non starter for me. Even if you don't use this combo a lot, there might be other combos that don't work and just out of principal I don't think it's a good idea to support a product that doesn't actually allow you to type something and have it go to the computer.",2022,01
i could afford a way more expensive keyboard but honestly i love this one,2022,01
"The keys where not sensitive enough, but overall it’s pretty good for gaming.",2022,01
No problems at all but accidently broke the dongle and they replaced it for free. Best customer service ever.,2022,01
I bought one for my grandson and he seemed to like it for gaming.  We had to return the first one for the same reason.  So that was two.  His second one is still working so we decided it must have been an isolated incident. I wanted the colored backlighting as well and it was still rated higher than most so I purchased one for myself. Bad idea. This morning it worked when I signed in to my computer and then stopped working in the middle of a meeting.  Do not trust this product.  I cannot even return the most recent one and I do not understand why. Out of 40 bucks.,2022,01
Pretty cheap product. Is a 9.99 keyboard from Staples with LEDs,2021,09
grandson loves it,2021,06
"I bought this for my boyfriend who games and uses it for work. He loves it. It looks great; quiet keys that are very responsive. He can also use it from the couch when he hooks the computer up to the TV (the usb is behind a table and on the bottom shelf of our entertainment, about 4 feet away).While I was writing this, I asked him if he had an criticisms and he said that it charges fine but the charger can feel like it’s hard to get in or not in all the way, but again, no issues charging. I’d just be mindful of that. 🙂",2022,01
"The attached picture is for a review of the stickers (the letter ""A"") that I had to buy for this keyboard. If you look at the paint that outlines the ""s"" key, it's wearing off. Other keys are wearing off, too, and once they wear off, you can't see the letters. You just see globs of colored light. What use is an illuminated keyboard if you can't see the keys? What's more, if you don't touch the keyboard for 30 seconds, the illumination disappears and the keyboard is completely dark (even when it's plugged in). The only way to ""wake"" it is to touch the keyboard again, so now you have keystrokes on your screen, in your document, on your game, etc., that you didn't want. I know keyboards wear out, but I've only had this one for a few months.**Very shortly after I submitted this review and after I took the time to add all of the stickers to the keyboard, it began to malfunction and add characters that I wasn't even typing. I gave up and retired it after about 7 months.****UPDATE--I never contacted the seller about the keyboard. When they saw the feedback, they reached out TO ME and replaced the keyboard for free without having to return the defective product. Four stars because I will have to see how the keyboard works out for me this time, but I must give KLIM Technologies USA SIX STARS for outstanding customer service!!!",2022,01
First rate fromPackaging to product. Son just wanted something different. Thanks again,2022,01
"I barely used this keyboard as i purchased it over winter break. 10 days into it and it started lagging and wouldn't accept all they keys I would push and lag overall. Big disappointment.. skip this and pay for a better quality keyboard. Connectivity issues seems to be the problem, cheaply made.",2022,01
"This is a horrible product. My son has gone through two of these keyboards and they do not hold up/keep their charge. They both were used for about 2-8 weeks before they would not keep their charge and would stop working within a few minutes, after charging all night. This product is absolute garbage.",2022,01
"Horrible , garbage , don’t wast your money",2022,01
"Very pleased with the keyboards feel and function.  Simple, yet durable feeling and the mechanical feel is great.  Also, I must say that I quite enjoyed learning about the team of specialists in the provided documents.  Quite funny and entertaining.  I have placed probably over 1000 orders over Amazon, and I do not generally leave reviews, but this company stuck out so I wanted to give them a shout out.",2022,01
Cracked really fast. Illumination isn't very bright. Stand by mode turns off lights. Very light and slick. Sometimes hard to hold if you need to move it. Lights do not flicker.Just cheap.,2022,01
"After using a game controller (which was touchy and took forever to enter search information), sprung for this great looking and easy to use keyboard.  The backlit feature is a must, and it paired perfectly with an Xbox One S console. Charging was a snap, and it's just what you need if you're doing a lot of searches on your preferred streaming services.  Would be helpful if the instructions included more information on key functions.",2022,01
"I bought this for my son for Christmas. I unfortunately I bought it early and the return window is closed.This keyboard will not connect to his computer. I have also tried my computer and it will not connect either.We have tried every USB port on both computer and nothing. The keyboard lights up, but nothing else.",2022,01
"I purchased this on Dec 4 ,  Just about a month I've been using it.  Just quit working today.  Turned off and back on  and restarted computer .  Still doesn't work.  So I'm not happy I got  only a month out of it and it stopped working.",2022,01
Like product thaks.,2021,12
Keyboard is small and ok not strong lighting in the light.  My main issue is that the volume up and down don't work.  To me this makes this a non purchase!,2021,12
Purchase as gift,2021,12
"I bought this for my 12 year old son. He loves it and uses it everyday, haven't had a problem yet.Would recommend!!!",2021,12
It stopped working after 6 days.,2021,12
Works fine but the battery dies really really fast  so not good for gaming or for someone that is constantly using a keyboard,2021,12
I actually had to return this (it was even a Christmas gift so thank god I gave it early and found out..) it didn’t work whatsoever after one day of it being fine.,2021,12
"The product was quite obviously not new - the product box (not the shipping box) was damaged and had return labels peeled off; the keyboard had a corner broken off and there was dust all over it; the dongle for wireless use was not included, nor were any cords.  Horrible experience.",2021,12
"I bought by keyboard in 2020, had no issues until 1 of the keys started getting stuck after heavy use (about 12 hours per day for a year). Contacted customer service since it was under warranty and was sent a brand new keyboard instantly without an exchange. I would strongly recommend this company and their products",2021,12
"Item worked well when it worked, but it no longer charges after 6 months of use.  USB on keyboard doesn’t seem to work anymore.  Now being 6 months from purchase I can’t return it.  Recommend getting a different product that may last longer.",2021,12
The keyboard just stopped working after a month. I used a different cable and used the USB of my Alienware. It started working again.,2021,12
Like it. Works great and seems to last long.,2020,06
"Great price, lightweight, charges fast & lasts a long time or plug in to use, love the backlight, quiet, waterproof for accidental spills, overall great keyboard. Better than one that I paid 5x as much for.",2021,12
Just right for when working at night and not wanting to turn extra lights on.,2021,12
"We wanted silent keys.  These are regular, noisy keys.  Returning since not as advertised.",2021,12
"I didn't even notice until I started typing on it, but the forward slash key is to the left of the enter key instead of above, so I always accidentally hit it instead of the enter key. Nothing bad to say about the keyboard otherwise, just a strange design. I'll probably hang onto it as a backup, but the weird key placement is a dealbreaker for me.",2021,12
I was told the item was perfect. Brought item for teenage sons birthday. Claims it to be the best gift he had in years,2021,12
Great product for the price. My son loves it. No complaints.,2021,12
"does what i wanted fits the space i need it to , worked fine with Win 11",2021,12
arrived on time as exactly as described .  The key board is wireless and works great .  The battery lasts a long time,2021,12
"I started using this keyboard and it was perfect... until I hit the spacebar.  The spacebar makes a rattling noise when you even touch it at all.  You don't even have to press it down.  It's unavoidable to make this sound no matter how gingerly you press the key.  Unless this was a single unit problem, this design is garbage as a ""silent keyboard"".",2021,12
"It feels cheap.  Compared to my Corsair, it is just average.  I'm sorry, but I am spoiled.  The only thing it has going for it is that it is wireless, which is why I will keep and use it.  The keyboard seems to be smaller.  I am a touch typist and my fingers feel cramped.  I think it impedes my typing speed; I'm pretty good at above 75 wpm.  I don't use it for gaming, I write voraciously, and need a keyboard that has quick response.  This one is ummmmm... just okay.",2021,12
"I don't write reviews very often but I will make an exception for this piece of junk. Were you wanting a wireless keyboard? Because this is not wireless. It requires a usb cable for power. Oh, yes indeedy! And so now you are using not one but TWO of your USB ports for this BS. What a waste of time",2021,11
"After using it for a couple hours on its initial charge, I plugged it in using the given charging cable but it would never charge. I plugged it in to my computer, the wall, and with a different usb-c charger and nothing worked. I cannot recommend anyone to purchase this product when it does not charge properly. If it worked I would have given it a 5 star review because it looks nice, has RGB, and had very little latency despite being wireless. Do not buy this product.",2021,11
"I like this keyboard very much, but was hoping for something a bit smaller or thinner per se. It's a normal size keyboard, a little larger than expected.",2021,11
"I initially wrote a bad review about this keyboard.  I thought it stopped working.  It turns out someone removed the usb receiver from my hub.  My computer is in a dark spot in the basement so I didn't notice.  The Klim keyboard is awesome.  Great battery life, quiet and feels amazing!",2021,11
"Here are a few major issues - I bought this keyboard for 4 main reasons: It was supposed to be ergonomic, silent, lit up, and good qualityErgonomic: This is not ergonomic. It's a black ordinary keyboard with some lights.Silent Keyboard: This is NOT silent. It is the loudest keyboard I have had in years.Lights: I thought you could decide what lights shine through the keyboard, NOPE! You get to pick how bright it is, and whether it's solid, ""breathing"", flickering, or off. The color pattern never changes. The worst part is after 30 seconds of not using the keyboard all of the lights turn off, which is really problematic when it's dark and you are relying on the lights to see they letters.Quality: It feels like cheap plastic. Overall I give this a 1/5 stars, would not purchase it again.",2021,11
"so far so good although my first impression is that putting the on/off switch underneath is stupid.lights going off after a minute is problematic in the dark unless you really know your touch-typing.fn+pause =  lights high, low or offif reviews are accurate, now I'll wait to see if I got one that lasts.",2021,11
This is a great keyboard except for the fact that the enter key is not wide enough. The backslash key takes the place of where the first bit of the enter key should go. Will probably end up returning because I don't want to relearn how to type to make up for a smaller enter key.,2021,11
"Bought this for a family member and decided I wanted one as well. Worked like a cha for both of us, also I lo e the way it sounds.",2021,11
"I was a little apprehensive about buying this keyboard at first because I didn’t want anything shaped too “gamey”, or angular, I guess you could say- but I was too impatient to wait another 24 hours for a different style to ship out :) so I jumped on this one and I don’t even notice the shape anymore at all. I love this keyboard. The keys are not completely silent but almost the perfect amount of soft “clickiness”; just enough to let you know you’ve hit a key. The colors are vibrant and so fun, even in broad daylight. So far battery life is great. Love that you can charge and still use it at the same time (some won’t allow this). The only thing I’ll have to get used to is the enter/return key is about an inch farther to the right than I’m used to, but that matters less to me every day. Very happy!",2021,11
Kind of bummed. Worked great for 5 months and now won’t charge so not useable. Kid isn’t a hard gamer so didn’t use but once or twice a week. Maybe others had better luck but it’s a no go for us.,2021,11
Great battery life. Still feels flimsy and sometimes the keys are delayed.,2021,11
This was good for a couple weeks and then the reception became extremely poor. I would personally go for another keyboard in my opinion.Also Amazon will not refund it. BS if you ask me! Just go with a wired keyboard!,2021,09
"Bought this at the end of September... It's about 2 months now and for the past several weeks the keyboard hasn't been working. I've tried everything. It lights up when I click keys, but it doesn't type and then the RGB colors just go away. It was constantly plugged in since the battery life was terrible. But now it looks like I wasted money and will need to go back to my old keyboard. Find a different keyboard, don't buy this!!",2021,11
"When received there was a mystery liquid on the number pad. I chose to assume maybe a it was a cleaning fluid of some sort, wiped it off and moved on with my life. Its supposedly water proof per advertisement right? Keyboard works fine while plugged in and has quiet keys but will not hold a charge. Advertised as bluetooth and has a bluetooth connector but only working as a wired keyboard at this point and the backlight is super dim, even at the highest ‘brightness’. Maybe mine was faulty but personally, do not recommend.",2021,11
"I dislike the Way too Big ""Enter Key""",2021,11
I have no complaints as of right now. I love it!!!,2021,11
I purchased this keyboard because it was wireless and it claimed it would be great for gaming with fast response time. That my friends is a joke! When I can actually get the keyboard to turn on.. it takes several moments for it to reconnect (it goes into sleep mode all the time) and getting they keys to respond is extremely hard! I do not in any way recommend this keyboard! It also says 30 feet… your lucky to get 10 feet before you start having connectivity issues!,2021,11
"It’s smaller than I’m used to and light. The battery seems to work well and I don’t turn on and off, just goes to sleep. It has the enter bar in a different configuration and is tighter than I’m than used to and that has been a change to get accustomed to. I like it though.",2021,11
"Left CTRL + Shift + __ keyboard shortcuts are unresponsive on this keyboard, meaning this is unusable for my workflow.  I don't know how this keyboard is rated so highly and continues to be sold with KNOWN hardware issues like this. Also the spacebar makes an awful twang noise when it's tapped.",2021,11
"Keys are very clickety/loud and the space bar literally squeaks. Battery charge doesn’t last long and cuts out completely with no warning. Is NOT functional while charging plugged into the computer. Otherwise, I suppose it’s functional. Backlighting is nice to have, though I’m sure it drains the battery more quickly. No obvious way to turn that feature off when not needed.",2021,11
"I barely use my keyboard. I sit on couch and watch Netflix etc aka don't even use it for gaming. And after like 6 months at least the V button the 1 button don't work whatsoever. They say the keyboard lasts at least a decade.....hmmmmmmm. Buy something else, as now I have to as well",2021,11
"There is lot of delay when we use numpad. Left shift doesn’t work as regular keyboards do (may be this is intentional, I did not read the full description before buying). Unfortunately I have to return this product. Sleep mode works so good.",2021,11
"This is a great keyboard for the price.The keys are mushy, it’s not particularly comfortable, and it runs out of battery more quickly than I’d like.BUT it’s water proof, consistent, and INEXPENSIVE. if you’re someone like me who has a history of drowning expensive keyboards in water, look no further.I’ve already tried to ruin this keyboard a couple of times, but a quick wipe down and it keeps chugging along.This is a tremendous keyboard for the price.",2021,11
I splurged and bought an expensive keyboard.  It stopped working in 1 month with light use. I tried to resync the dongle and spent several hours troubleshooting.  I am totally disappointed.,2021,11
I use this product for aesthetic when studying. It’s really great.,2021,11
Stopped charging after a few months. Waste!,2021,11
"This keyboard looks great and works well!# Great customer Service:I got this keyboard when the pandemic first hit. It worked great for a few months and then one of the keys (""j"") started to misbehave. Not having time to deal with it I put it to the side and forgot about it. After picking it back up and trying again more of the keys had stopped working (about 2 years later). I reached out to customer service siting the 5 year warranty and they were absolutely wonderful (both helpful and very nice) and replaced the product. Now I have the new keyboard and have been using it and have not had any troubles!",2021,11
"Is exactly what I was looking for, now I can lean back and push to talk as comfortably as I want",2021,11
"Keyboard is cute.  But I've rubbed the letters off after just two months of use.  And some of the keys don't work like they should (like ctrl+arrow to move over a whole word.  It works to the right, but not to the left). I'm going to have to replace it soon.",2021,10
"This keyboard is great. The room I work in can get pretty dark and the backlit keys are so fun and functional.The usb cord broke and I asked customer service what I should look for to replace it, and they sent me a free one free of charge!I had another keyboard that I used while I waited for the cord and this one is so much better: the keys feel good and I can type fast without missing letters.Great value, great keyboard, and great customer service!",2021,10
"If I would give a zero I would, the keys are cheap and the lettering has worn after only  a couple of months.",2021,10
It is a terrible keyboard.  There is nothing good I can say about this piece of junk.,2021,10
so so,2021,10
"I initially got this keyboard for my wife and all the work she was doing but her laptop keyboard had gone out. This keyboard was so awesome and user friendly, I love the key impact, I love the light up nature and I liked it so much that I purchased one for myself for work. It's a solid keyboard for the money. Great value.",2021,09
Working great no problem,2020,02
"I got this when it was on sale for 50% off and I consider myself to have been ripped off. This keyboard sucks. It sometimes works, sometimes it doesnt... even keeping it plugged in (defeating the whole purpose of a wireless keyboard) doesn't guarantee it will work. The lights are cool, or whatever, but they don't make up have unconscionably awful it is. Even something as simple as writing this review is taking three times longer than it should. DO NOT BUY!!! you have been warned. KEEP looking, there are better products from better companies. Do yourself a favor, Spend that extra thirty seconds, spend the same money, and get a working product.",2021,10
Love this keyboard!,2021,10
sent back,2021,10
This is exactly what I needed and love the lighted keyboard.  Great value. And a shout out to the Amazon Delivery people who are careful to place packages safely on my porch out of the weather!!  Superior service!!,2021,10
"I bought this keyboard because it was one of the cheaper ones with decent reviews and I have to admit for the first month or so it was great but now it doesn’t connect well wirelessly and it’s a hassle to try and get it to register the keys I’m pressing which is frustrating. When I first got it, there were no issues and it was comfortable enough to use like most standard keyboards and the RGBs are nice but the sleep mode gets a tad bit annoying after a while.",2021,10
"I had this keyboard for 11 months and recently, as other reviewers have mentioned, the Bluetooth receiver fell apart. It was kind of loose in the USB port for a while, but I managed to leave it alone. However, packing and unpacking my laptop more than usual on a business trip jiggled it enough that it came out. Except the shell of the receiver is still stuck in the port, I will have to take it somewhere to have a professional use pliers and whatever to unstick that without damaging the laptop as I would likely do on my own. While it was working the keyboard performed fine. I only had to plug it in to charge it a few times. Since it didn't even last a year because one of the most essential elements was made with shoddy materials I have to give 2 stars though.",2021,10
"I type fast. I don’t know how many words a minute, but it’s fast. This silly thing won’t keep up with me. I have to constantly stop and backspace to retype. It’s pretty, good battery life but if you type fast you might want to look elsewhere",2021,10
The keyboard does what its supposed to do....its just really noisy compared to my other keyboards. Otherwise the colors are cool and the keyboard does what its supposed to do. Its just noisy.,2021,10
"I purchased this for my desk at work, it’s fantastic! It was easy to get up and running, and it was just wonderful eliminating the cords that were all over my desk. Great product.",2021,10
"I bought this in June, it is October now. The left side of my keyboard's keys work intermittently, which is annoying when typing a paragraph or more and it is filled with mistakes. I think the rest is going to fail soon. Complete waste of $35, you can find something better.",2021,10
Completely stopped working not able to return it not worth it,2021,10
Although i haven’t tested its water resistance cause im paranoid 😬,2021,10
I ordered this for my husband. Our living room is SMALL… and this keyboard lags sooo much! We’ve ordered a replacement and it’s just as terrible. save your time and order elsewhere.,2021,10
"It's decent but the power button was finicky and doesn't turn on I have to mess with it a little, feels kinda cheap but it will do for now",2021,10
I wanted a Light Up Key Board so I could work in the dark.  This fit the bill.  Came in two days after I order it.,2021,10
"(1) Left control does not work in combination with many commands (e.g. open incognito tab, reopen a closed tab) super annoying!(2) Wireless connectivity is super questionable even when the dongle's less than a foot away.(3) The enter key is huge-not at all a comfortable layout",2021,10
"I got a faulty keyboard and they were happy to exchange it, but the return process was a huge hassle. I needed a box and to print a label unlike typical Amazon returns, which I found out when I showed up to UPS. The replacement item works perfectly.",2021,10
I bought a wireless keyboard so I could play 4-6 feet away from my desktop. It looses it's connection often from this distance. Its pretty frustrating.,2021,10
I have my computer in the living room with the midi connections attached directly to t.v. With this wireless keyboard I can now use my computer more effectively.,2021,09
"The colors are great.  The charging time is great and the battery life is great.  Unfortunately, this is quite difficult to type on and feels extremely cheap.  The old saying, ""You get what you pay for"" comes to mind!",2021,09
"I admit, the placement of the Enter key is a little weird, but otherwise it's a great keyboard.  I don't use it for gaming -- it's just my wireless keyboard I use for remote work at home.  I have long nails and, consequently, my typing can be really noisy, so I love how quiet the keys are on this keyboard.  After a month, battery life is really good so far.  And the colors are pretty!!!",2021,09
"i m rently sing the keyboard to type this reew if you notice any missing letters, thts ply the adyig  meai type this out. i dont know i this is a inditra atter r  sily  ulty  pd.in all seriousness that speaks for itself i just plugged the keyboard to a charger to finish typing this review. there may be some issue with the battery level indicator. there' no actual warning before that starts happening. i type at maybe 30-35 wpm and the sentence above was gibberish. dropped input after dropped input. this keyboard is OK for casual webpage scrolling but don't rely on it to do ANYTHING important after the first hour of use.",2021,09
Wouldn't Even Mind the Fact That I Have to Keep It Plugged in 99% of the Time if It Actually Stayed Plugged in.,2021,09
"I bought this keyboard about a year ago and have used it extensively with no issues whatsoever up until recently, when the Bluetooth dongle stopped responding.  I contacted Klim customer service to request a new dongle because the keyboard itself was in perfect working condition.  They told me that they were in the process of moving warehouses and it would be faster to send me a new keyboard.  They shipped an entirely new keyboard within a few days.  I am beyond astounded at how fantastic their customer service is.  I did not ask for a new keyboard yet they offered one, just to make me a satisfied customer.  I plan on using Klim products from hereon in, whenever I need tech that they sell.  I highly recommend this company and I applaud how excellent their customer service is!",2021,09
"Can't even press most three-key combinations. Try Ctrl+Shift+End for example, which is supposed to select text until the end of a document, but it doesn't work on this keyboard.",2021,09
"There is literally an extra key between the "" and the enter key - the \ is before the enter key... I guess if I was more of a gamer maybe this would make sense ??? but since I want to type more this is terrible.  Why would you change a keyboard layout?",2021,09
I really liked the keyboard. I used it for work and some gaming. but it died on me a few weeks later.,2021,09
Perfect for gaming. My grandson loved the different colors.,2021,09
I love it,2021,09
"This was one of two KLIM products I currently own, and it performs beautifully for gaming and casual pc use. The on/off option for the backlight is awesome. Keystrokes are great, I love that there aren’t unnecessary tabs sticking out everywhere. Perfect keyboard to sit on your lap.",2021,09
"I loved this keyboard until it started acting up after about 7 months of use.  It was started jumping to different parts of a cell or clearing what was in the cell.  Since it was a work day, I was lucky to have another keyboard I was able to use until I get a replacement.",2021,09
I was attracted to this keyboard due mainly to the colorful lighting. But after a couple of days of use I just couldn't handle the noise the spacebar made.  If you use the spacebar a lot for gaming you may become distracted and irritated.I think I liked the IDEA of this keyboard better than the keyboard itself.,2021,09
"i love this this, so pretty. battery life has been good, only charged once so far in 2 weeks",2021,09
Very good battery life especially when i accidentally leave it on,2021,09
"comfortable keyboard,very good must have!",2021,09
"My husband is a gamer and was in need of a new keyboard. He chose this one because it had everything he wanted and needed, especially the wireless feature as he likes to lay back and not worry about dealing with cords. I'm pretty sure he dropped it on his desk a few times and it is still going. The colors are vibrant, types well and looks very nice. Highly recommend this great value!",2021,09
Good enough keyboard. Really regret getting it though as I have to charge it every week so it would have been better for me to have just gotten a wired keyboard or one that takes batteries.,2021,09
New Outcome:I had issues with my 1st keyboard. I reached out to the seller and they helped me troubleshoot my device until we figured it needed to be replaced.They gladly sent me a new keyboard which is now working as expected.  Will definitely recommend this brand._____________Old review:This keyboard is rechargable and does NOT have an option fir batteries. It worked for a month and half. It doesnt hold charge. Mine diesn't work at all. I wasted $40 and now I need to buy another keyboard.,2021,09
Finally got it to connect and it doesn't register most keystrokes. There website doesn't have a driver to download. Unsure how to resolve this problem. This is a paper weight at the moment.,2021,09
"I am very much a ""casual"" gamer but even so, I would not recommend this keyboard to anyone.  Latency is awful, keystrokes are either missed or repeated - which means I wouldn't even use this for office applications.  Yeah, it is ""cheap"", I guess, except that you might as well set your $40 on fire.  Why not save a little more and get something of quality that will actually hold up to the task(s) for which you bought it?  Also, you know it's mediocre junk when Amazon does not even want it sent back as a return...",2021,09
"Took it out of the box, set it up, 30 minutes later it stopped working completely.",2021,09
Everything was good on except for the fact that the battery went bad really fast. Like within 20 hours of use. it would not hold any sort of charge after that.,2021,09
"I love this keyboard so much that I bought two. love the backlit lights , especially if you like to play games or just use in general in the dark or very low light, and not bad for its price.......",2021,09
"Wanted this for a living room computer. Put the Wifi reciever into a usb port in back of the pc by my tv and if I use the charging cable that came with it I got further away than using the Wifi component it seems.... which means you get between 4-6ft of range.For anything other than using it across a room it does seem responsive, easy to use, and other wise a great keyboard. But if you want to sit more than 5ft from your computer you may want something else.",2021,09
"Good colors, fast shipping",2021,09
"The cool features for gaming notwithstanding (multi-colored back-light keys that can ""breathe"" or ""rotate""), this is an excellent all-around multi-function keyboard for general PC workload, including function buttons that allow dimming, brightness, volume control, etc. Keys are responsive, and charge lasts about 4-5 hours of gaming, depending on usage and how bright the settings of the back-lighting for the keys are set. Plus, the customer service at KLIM is top-notch. Highly recommended. You will not be disappointed.",2021,08
"This company deserves 5 stars for their incredibly prompt and wonderful customer service.  This company truly stands by their product.  My Klim keyboard stopped working after about 1.5 years.  Since they had a 5 year warranty, I reached out and they quickly responded. They asked me to shipped the defective keyboard back to them (they would refund the shipping cost) and they would also send me a new replacement keyboard in the meantime.  However, I realized I really don't care for this keyboard's layout. I don't use this keyboard for gaming, it's primarily for work. So the short ""Enter"" key was irritating at times.  Unlike standard keyboard, this one has three keys in between the ""L"" and ""Enter"" keys rather than just two keys like typical keyboards. So I declined their replacement offer. I didn't want to go through the shipping hassel for a replacement that I don't care for. I was just going to cut my loss, look for something else, and thought that was the end of it. However, they immediately offered me a full refund or the option to try the upgraded version that has the standard layout- the v2 light.  I opted for the latter.  The keys in the upgraded version are very quiet and feels a bit ""mushy"". But it works great and I highly recommend this company.  You can definitely purchase with confidence.  They really do stand behind their warranty and the level of customer service they provided was top notch.  They were extremely caring, easy, quick, and hassel free.",2021,09
"This is a great and affordable keyboard. Great response time, feels great to type on, useful in the dark, and long lasting battery.",2021,09
"Very cheap for the price. I received the item and I did not work, some of the keys didnt work. Tired to return this item to Amazon but it is a non returnable item. even if it is broken. Now I am out 40 dollars. Beware stay away from this product",2021,09
"When in doubt, always look at the Most Recent reviews rather than Most Popular. I really wanted to like this keyboard. It started off fine, but then the battery would hold its charge less and less. Within a month of owning it, it needed to be plugged into the USB charger all of the time or else it would immediately lose its charge and turn off. So now I have a functionally wired keyboard after trying to buy a wireless one. Speaking of function, the numpad keys DO NOT WORK. And the USB C charging cable is ridiculously short, I have to use an extension cord just to use it on my standing desk. The USB C cable must be special, because none of the other USB-C cables I own work with it (Macbook, Oculus, Jabra, even a cable that specifically said it would work with this keyboard!). The RGB was one of the main reasons why I bought this keyboard but it leaves a lot to be desired--it's not that bright and isn't dynamic when typing. Save your money, unless you really want to spend $40 for a paper weight.",2021,09
"At first glance, the keyboard looks and feels nice. The keys are decently silent (though very loud compared to my other low-profile minimalistic keyboard), and the RGB is cool. However, there are several design flaws that make it very annoying to use:1) The Function key is on the right-side of the spacebar, which is non-standard, so very weird to use2) Keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+Shift+I for dev tools in Chrome (I am a programmer) only works on the right-side of the keyboard, not the left which I'm used to and works on every other keyboard I've ever used => and the issue cannot be fixed with the Klim reset keyboard combo, so you're stuck with the issue3) The RGB is somewhat faint, and even on the static setting doesn't stay on; it dims after not very long at all of inactivity, making me have to constantly type to keep it onOverall, I would save your money. You could get a much better keyboard for the same price that doesn't have the glitches or annoyances. I'm honestly surprised this keyboard has so many good reviews and that Klim continues to sell a known defective product without offering returns. What a sham.",2021,09
I purchased this keyboard in January and it worked great.  Now it has stopped working.  I reinstalled the drives and still nothing. Hope they will stand by their product and send me a replacement.,2021,09
This is functional in the sense that it does have keys.Too bad it has a 14 minute battery life and you cannot use it while it’s charging.Absolute trash product. Tempted to just throw it away.,2021,09
"If you're a programmer or generally use the CTRL/SHIFT key combo, please skip this. The left CTRL/SHIFT combination doesn't work so you'll have to retrain yourself to use the right only. Apparently this is a known and ongoing issue. It's not worth the time or effort.",2021,09
I am still working with it to review the mouse connection and other parts and then other features to it. So far so good,2021,09
"The 5-year warranty reeled me in. Unfortunately, I needed the 10-Key feature to work and neither the light indicator nor the 10-Key functions worked. It also had initial charging issues. It took 3 days to charge. Then it was charging but not for very long (2-3 hrs). CS said the only option was to exchange so I did. The exchange charged right away but the 10-Key & CAPS indicator didn't work. The 10-Key functions didn't work either. The CS on the exchange told me that I could have just returned it the first time and not go through the exchange process. That process turnaround time was a couple of weeks lost. Spend more money and get a better keyboard, one with established reviews & a track record. In this case, a 5-year warranty was marketing only because the keyboard never performed at 100%.",2021,09
Worked for a single week before it stopped typing.,2021,09
"I’ve used this keyboard for a couple months, and I am completely happy.  The keys are satisfying to press, the battery life is long and the aesthetic is great.",2021,08
"Very nice keyboard, easy to set up, easy to use, all the keys function great.",2021,08
"I loved this keyboard but after after maybe a year of owning it, it doesn't hold a charge and doesn't worked when plugged in. Very bummed.",2021,08
"It failed after one month; I have to have the charging cable permanently connected or it goes dead.  In addition, it is rather bulky compared to other keyboards.  I am sorry I bought it and I missed the return deadline by one day!",2021,08
Poorly built. Don’t order.,2021,08
The keyboard’s colors cannot be set to a single color but the brightness can be dimmed or turned off. The charge only lasts 2 days. The keys are very quiet (a feature I was looking for). I gave 4 stars due to the short battery life.,2021,08
"Well for starters you can't beat the price of a true-wireless computer keyboard. Like most of the other reviews I didn't care for the battery life. So after losing power one night and the battery had died in the keyboard I looked over to my power-bank and said to myself why not?Not only does it work, I can sit on the couch about 12 feet or so? from the TV and don't need to worry about the keyboard battery life nor having a super-long charging cable.*knocks on wood*So far the keyboard has been holding up, and can say that it has paid for its self. The only issue I have with it is the [Enter] button. I like to make ':\' emoji faces and every time I go to make one I always do ':' instead. Other then that great budget friendly keyboard.",2021,08
"Very cool keyboard. Works great. But after a couple of weeks (after return window closed), it will only work when plugged into power. Kinda defeats the point of having a wireless keyboard.",2021,08
i have tryed many times to change the colors and they wont change. but the battery last for a good long time,2021,08
"Ok, so there is nothing ""wrong"" with this keyboard, but NOWHERE in the description did it say that it had a matte finish. The keys have a slightly sandpaper-y feel to them that I just cannot handle as a highly sensory sensitive person. Every time I touch a key it is like nails on a chalkboard. It was a great price, so I decided to use it as a keyboard for my TV (used very infrequently) instead of my primary computer keyboard, rather than return it. I am now shopping for an alternative primary keyboard to use.",2021,08
Keyboard worked great for the longest time but ive had it for a bit over a year and now typing is progressively become more difficult due to the lost key presses. its got bad enough to affect games now so my player stops and takes stuttering steps before returning back to normal for a short while.,2021,08
The keys start to fade and you can't see the letters/numbers after repeated use.,2021,08
this keyboard has a short battery life and doesn't give any sort of indication that the battery is low till it stops working. then when you charge it it doesn't let you know when its done. it also doesn't seem to like any alt or windows key related shortcuts from the left side only the right,2021,08
Product is fine but it's super limited to what it can do you are stuck with the rainbow colors for the lights which is not what the description sounds like so I would say this is nearly false advertisement based off of wording but it's probably translated through 3 levels of Google translate so who knows.Obviously is a membrane keyboard and it's very squishy. The lighting isn't bad and the only gamer thing about this is the RGB you can't control I would have rather had a completely red one.I am going to find another keyboard and return this one for its lack of functionality.,2021,08
I had a slight issue and was sent a new keyboard with express shipping. Turned out the original keyboard worked after all. Great customer support.,2021,08
"Got this keyboard as a replacement for a previous wireless keyboard. I liked the multi colored backlight functionality, however what I do not like is that the lights turn off after about 10 seconds of no use. I wanted this keyboard to stay lit up but it just doesn’t do that. Still works and functions like a good keyboard I just hoped that the lights would stay on longer.",2021,08
"The Keyboard lights on, but is slow and the key almost break.Didn't like quality.",2021,08
"light weight, rechargable. lights are cute,although they dont change. no batteries needed this is nice",2021,08
The key “labels” are wearing off after 3 months.,2021,08
"I really like this keyboard, it’s great because it’s pretty and lightweight. I don’t like that the charger is so weird though it has a tendency to get loose. That’s the only thing I found wrong though.Don’t leave the power on I don’t think this has a sleep mode you’ll come back and this thing will be stone dead lol. I always shut this off when I’m done with it.",2021,08
"Been looking for a good first wireless keyboard that won't break the bank and have been pretty satisfied. I've used this keyboard for 3 weeks and haven't had any issues. The keyboard itself is very lightweight, as for gaming I've had no issues across multiple games. A great starter wireless keyboard for the price!",2021,08
"OK, I tried everything in the world to get this keyboard to work:  plugged the dongal into the USB port, charged it up overnight, and finally restarted the computer.  I looked at the bottom of the keyboard and saw nothing!  But there is a very tiny button that blends in with the rest of the keyboard which is in the 'off' position when it first arrives.  TURN THE BUTTON ON!  This message is for people who haven't had to buy a new keyboard in a million years, like me...  Hope it helps all the non-techie people out there...  I love the colors on the keyboard, and because of my set-up, the keyboard is in a fairly dark area in a pull-out beneath the desk.  So this is really, really helpful.  Very light to the touch as advertised!  I'm not a gamer, but you don't have to be to appreciate this keyboard!",2021,08
"Great for the money, matches my expectations.",2021,08
Amazing keyboard and the best customer service ever. I will definitely use this company from now on for computer accesories,2021,08
"Battery is running quickly, I have to charge every two weeks.",2021,08
"I ordered this and loved it performance looks everything. After a week or two it died completely and i couldnt get it to charge, the light never came on i left it plugged in for over 12 hrs got maybe 30 mins of use out of it. Told seller and they replaced it with another really fast was happy with that. However same exact issue with the 2nd one it works perfectly for about two weeks used it for a whole day it has died completely another round of 8 hrs or more of charging. And it died after 10 mins. One star for a unreliable product. Otherwise it looks and performs great. Seller seems ontop of there game but product seems to not charge",2021,08
"works great out of the box, shipping was fast.  I dont really know what makes it a gaming keyboard but it looks cool and feels nice on my fingers",2021,08
"The button don't work 😒..Do not buy this Keyboard , very cheap like it need to be $2.00 Keyboard ..",2021,08
"Just as the title says, works great, solid battery life, all functions work as described. Another winner from Klim!!",2021,08
I love this keyboard so far. Awesome colors! Great ergonomics! Really good for gaming as well. My one complaint is the position of the enter key. Could be a little closer to the pinky. Other than that! This is the perfect keyboard!,2021,08
I returned this because it was consistently laggier than a wired keyboard. My keyboard was about 3 feet away from the receiver and half the keystrokes would not register.,2021,08
"My son loves this product for gaming. We had a problem with the dongle, and they issued me a new keyboard within a week. I will order more products from this company without hesitation.",2021,08
My granddaughter loves it!,2021,08
"Buyer beware, used the keyboard for almost a year and it was pretty solid no complaints, but recently i went to charge the keyboard and the charging port started to smoke and burned the port and charging cable. Almost caused a fire in the office.",2021,08
"I purchased this 6 months ago for work at home. I really like everything about the keyboard accept the letter quality.  As you can see by my picture,  within 6 months the letters have started to rub off. It has the backlight but it doesn't matter because it lights the key and not the letter so you don't know which key it is unless you have them memorized. Next time I would pay a bit more for double shot/ laser etched.",2021,08
"Great for gaming and work from home, very silent and waterproof (accidentally tested) but the RGB could improve, more modes or disable the sleep mode could be great",2021,08
"After about two months, mine stopped holding a charge, although it works plugged in. Also, I noticed that space bar has gotten to be really loud compared to the keys. It looks super cute with the rainbow lights though.",2021,08
This keyboard looked like it was going to be exactly what I wanted but it died soon after I got it.,2021,08
Everything is great but the back space is a sticky key. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't .,2021,08
stopped working after two days,2021,08
"The backlight doesn’t stay on, only works when you’re actually typing, which is strange, but I can definitely live with it. Good quality otherwise. Keys are well made and are painted so you can see them even when it’s not lit up. Has multiple lighting modes that I really can’t figure out",2021,08
It’s a nice keyboard,2021,08
"Easy installation.  Lights don't say on the entire time only when keyboard is in use. Only down side is that it doesn't come with an extended warranty. So that is something they should work on. I only purchased this because my spacebar went out on my laptop, yes I could have brought it some where to have the whole keyboard replaced but why have those noisy techs all in the business and have to order it so all tge wait.. 🤔 nope I pass. Now I have this dope keyboard that lights up and works great!",2021,08
Is there a valid customer support? The website link goes to something completely different. My USB plug  fell apart and I want to inquire about a new one? I’ve had this keyboard for about 9 months and now I cannot use it.Update: Klim responded immediately and is sending out a new usb plug. I am impressed with the fast response and their willingness to help.,2021,08
Very nice keyboard bright but not too bright. Kind wish the sleep mode did turn on so quickly,2021,08
Bought this keyboard for my son who wanted a wireless for gaming. We let it charge for a full day. The first day it was fine though my son thought the lights would stay lit while he was using it. The second day it was lagging in its responses. We charged it again which helped but not for long. We returned it.,2021,08
"****BEWARE-STAY AWAY.....BOUGHT THIS KEYBOARD IN SEPT 2020, DID NOT EVEN LAST 1-YEAR! FULLY CHARGED, CHECKED CONNECTIONS, NOTHING....DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!!! YOU ARE THROWING AWAY $40 BUCKS.",2021,07
I did like the concept of a wireless back light keyboard. The key feel was not bad. My grievance is the wireless receiver stopped working about 60 days after purchase.,2021,07
Keyboard was for dual purpose but one was to use for my office computer.  Keys are nice and quiet but very responsive.  Nice looking obnoxious glow adds a little flare to my work station.,2021,07
"I’m glad that I ordered this keyboard, it’s been nice gaming on it.",2021,07
"I love how it feels, how typing sounds, lighting effects are really nice, best keyboard I have bought ever.Thanks KLIM for that nice card and gift included.",2021,07
"This is my first time purchased Mechanical Keyboard for regular office work.The Mechanical keyboard more tactile, and faster.I like that!!!",2021,07
They enter key is one extra key over to the right and you can't hit it with your pinkie while typing if you actually know how to type,2021,07
"I just got this keyboard for my stepdad, as I was building him a new PC. I ended up opening and using it to complete the install of software.I like the size and feel. It’s pretty light, but doesn’t feel cheap. Buttons feel good, quiet but good tactile feel. I haven’t played with color modes yet.It charges pretty quick. I haven’t used it enough to say how long it lasts.Not a deal breaker, but be aware you still need to plug the dongle into a USB port to use this keyboard, even if you have it plugged into ANOTHER USB port with the charging cable.Otherwise, seems decent…",2021,07
"I like everything about the keyboard, very quiet",2021,07
He stated it was sooooooooooooo gooooooooooood,2019,12
Love it I don’t use it for gaming but the keyboard is excellent I love the lights it has how it charges  usb c so that’s nice all around good key boardUPDATEI had to change my rating on this as it's now just broke. I trade stocks and crypto so I don't really  or use the keyboard in a gaming or super high type of way like other might that use it for gaming or such. But I was just using it as I normally to enter company's tickers to search around in the morning when it just turned off on me.  So ok I thought it was dead plugged it in no light of it charging so I turn it off let it sit for a couple mins so I turn it back on cause I just need to enter a couple letter real fast so I can check something it work n then turns back off so I switch it off again. Now I had to do that maybe about 3 times n now the turn off on switch is not moving back to the on position n nothing on the keyboard is working.  It's never fallen always been on my desk. No other moment not sure what happened here but it's not working,2021,07
"Nice item, works very well! Looks amazing!",2021,07
Got it for my brother and he has no issue with it. His only complaint was that the lights weren't customizable.,2021,07
I got this keyboard because the crappy logitech wireless keyboard my office gave me was not as responsive as I would like. This keyboard is very responsive since it is technically a gaming keyboard. The keys are quiet except the space bar which makes a click sound but it nothing major and is less noisy than my old keyboard.,2021,07
"Not too bad.  Feels good, however only reason I didn’t give a 5 star was that it stated it was quite but in my opinion it’s not that quite.",2021,07
"It may be one of the most uncomfortable keyboards I have ever used, the tilt is not a lot and very flimsy. I play it a lot gaming a MMo on my PS4, the sleep mode has been a killer.",2021,07
Bought two and both died after a week,2021,07
I purchased this keyboard in May and it's now July. I use this keyboard for gaming so I do use it quite a bit which is why I purchased it in the first place going off the reviews. I'm already having keys stick/not working which shouldn't be happening since I've only had it for less than 2 months 😑. It's worked great up until this last week but I guess I'm going to have to look into another keyboard now.,2021,07
Excellent gaming keyboard. I purchased this for my grandson and he loves it. Takes gaming to a whole new level with his xbox.,2021,07
We love it! We can type in a dark room and it’s so pretty!,2021,07
"Everything is precisely as advertised- which is what I needed for working from home. This keyboard was purchased to help keep me from slouching over my laptop key, which is smaller and doesn’t tilt up",2021,07
Very nice keyboard. Lots of color choices. Breathing speed can be adjusted from really slow to fast. Or you can choose to not breathe at all and keep a solid color. Well made. My only complaint is it shuts off after 60 seconds of non-use. But a simple touch of a button immediately turns it back on again. I contacted customer service for some questions regarding the lighting (nothing was wrong with the keyboard). Customer service was fantastic!! They responded to me immediately and answered all my questions. I would definitely recommend this keyboard.,2021,07
Great keyboard and even better Customer Service. Highly recommend,2021,07
"The lettering on the kb is so faint you can't see them unless the backlit is on. Problem is you can't turn Auto-dim off which means you have to hit a key to wake it up. If you can't have it backlit when you reach for it when gaming, it's utterly useless in a dark room. Does it work for the price? Yes. Does it work for gaming? Nope, not at all.",2021,07
I use it for work as a 911 dispatcher. I work at night in a dark room so I love the colored lights! Great keyboard,2021,07
I like to use a keyboard with my laptop and this is a good value. Like it!,2021,07
I like wireless keyboard,2021,07
Keyboard works well. Charge only lasts a few days and I have not been able to use it while charging.  There is no warning to let you know the battery is about to die.  Keyboard just stops working while your typing,2021,07
I love this. I like to work with dim lights in my office and this helps with my tasks. Charge lasts for a week or so.,2021,07
"I bought when I started to play more mouse/keyboard games and didn't want to be tethered to the computer. It's pretty, has a nice height with the little feet, but is a little glitchy sometimes. It might be that the charge is running out, but it puts itself to sleep (the lights turn off and the keys don't register) in bursts and I have to switch back to my wired keyboard.  The only fix is to plug it into the computer with a cord that is shorter than my existing wired keyboard cord :/",2021,07
"This keyboards has a decent design, however it disconnects very often. It's completely useless if I can't use it.",2021,07
"This keyboard works exactly as expected. Though it says it's a quite keyboard, its a fair amount louder than a silent keyboard like the Logitech one. The LED's are nice and able to adjust the brightness. I find this helpful because I work in a dark room at my PC. The dongle is able to connect easily and has good reception. The keystrokes are reliable and the keyboard well built with not completely smooth keys. I personally like the small amount of texture on the keys. The keyboard also goes to ""sleep"" after maybe a minute to save battery life. I charged it when I got it and have been using it for 6 days with heavy use 5 of those days. All in all, a solid keyboard for a reasonable price.",2021,07
This is a gift for Xmas so havnt used,2021,07
"Great keyboard! Easy to use, lasts a long time and very colorful",2021,06
It did not perform well for gaming the wireless connection was bad and it overall sucked,2021,06
We needed a wireless keyboard quickly and this keyboard from KLIM could not be a better find! The colors are fun and the keyboard has full keys that are quiet and responsive.  It takes up less space than our old model and so far it has been working really well.  Make sure you take a look at the booklet that comes with the keyboard.  It's a fun read about the company and the people who founded it.,2021,07
"Almost every time I type, the keyboard always misses a key press for some reason and I have to do it again. I don't know if it's the key sensitivity or something else but it's irritating.",2021,07
The keyboard is really nice but in the past weeks it doesn't pick up charge anymore. I tried different chargers and it doesn't work,2021,07
"Works sometimes... Very unreliable. I waited too long to return, due to trying different things so that's on me. Had to purchase a different keyboard.",2021,07
"I like this keyboard because it is a huge  improvement over my old non-backlit unit. I do believe that there is alot of room for us older folks with sight problems. The back lighting would be much improved by making it all one color, either bright white or the bright green. Increasing the size of the letters, numbers and symbols would also help. The unit functiond well and it was easy to put into operation. It is very light weight and is not as flimsy as some others who have rated it have mentioned. It is a keyboard; not a hammer.",2021,07
"It powers on and lights up well with every stroke..However-I wasn't able to get it to type, so I'm returning this keyboard.",2021,07
Keyboard stopped working after a month.,2021,07
It's a good keyboard just wish I could change the colors along with effect. It has a nice smooth key press.  Oh and it's what proof I'm told.,2021,06
Great keyboard as I use primarily for my PC.,2021,06
Great quality for the price. RGB is nice and bright. Key sound isn’t too bad. Not great for games that need key sensitivity.,2021,06
"Bought this  December  27th (now July 6th) and at first it was amazing!! I downloaded the drivers and it worked flawlessly. Now, 7 months later the keys have slowly stopped working, it misses keys I push all the time and it has become a hassle even trying to game. When it misses the keys my backlight will go out. If I press harder, it does nothing, if I roll my finger around the key I am holding, it will start working for a little while. My keyboard and desktop do not sit in a dusty or dirty environment either and neither are abused as well as my current mouse. This is an extremely low quality product and you definitely get what you pay for. I'd do business elsewhere. They also no longer offer the drivers on the website.",2021,06
"I was very excited about this keyboard, but unfortunately it has been a very bad experience. In general it is as presented in the advertisement, but after using it for 5 minutes it stops working completely even when it is turned on. I tried reinstalling the drivers, changing the USB port and trying it with another computer, but did not get good results, it does not work after a few minutes.I am very disappointed that I wasted my money on this product.",2021,06
"Y'all... Now I know that I haven't had this keyboard long at all (2-3 weeks), but it is a game changer. The sound of the keys isn't too loud, but it's not so soft that you feel unproductive! I love the way that the keys actually feel when I am typing. The color of the keyboard is great too. I would purchase this keyboard at full price all over again if I had to! #primeday",2021,06
"Only downside to this keyboard is that the enter key is too damn small, I keep on pressing ""/"", but other then that keyboard is fine",2021,06
I wasn't looking for an ultra gamer keyboard with the lowest latency and most responsiveness / highest keystrokes per minute possible. I was just looking for something I could see in low lighting at night and take with me to the couch to control the TV monitor with. This did the job perfectly. Battery seems to last about 30 hours on my count with the setting of full lighting every keystroke. Would recommend.,2021,06
The keys unfortunately are not silent and therefor returning this.,2021,06
Excelente,2021,06
Loved the backlit characters,2021,06
"Worked for about 2 months then stopped typing... will still charge and connect to bluetooth but will not actually type.  Amazon will only process returns for 30 days, so cannot return or get replacement.  Spend the extra money and buy name brand.",2021,06
"Pros _ the price, sleek design, wireless, easy plug and play.Cons _ space bar is extremely wobbly for claiming this to be ""silent"". The other keys are satisfactory to say the most in relevance to ""silent"" keys. Additionally the lights come on only if it's being used which isn't much of a con.",2021,06
"Keys are quite but not silent, responsive and not too firm. Lights look good (there is no light animation) and battery life is well so far thanks to the 1 minute no-use sleep mode that will turn off the lights to save battery. Overall a good wireless keyboard!",2021,06
"Charged it up and hooked it up to Xbox One.  Often missed key strokes, and duplicated key strokes.  Tried on a computer and seemed to work ok.",2021,06
Great for gaming and extremely satisfying to type on!!! The sleep mode comes on fast after 2 minutes of not using it and will immediately turn on once you start using it again. Definitely worth my money and the quality is  phenomenal!,2021,06
"Very nice Keyboard, love how it lights up.",2021,06
I hate when products work for awhile then stop working all the sudden. Definitely made cheap and definitely not worth the price. Whatever you do do NOT but this product. Worst keyboard ever.,2021,06
"The back lighting is great, it’s still a bit stiff compared to my old one but I’m getting used to it.  I highly recommend it, lots of bang for the buck.",2021,06
"The support team was extremely helpful. I had a problem with the USB connection and we got a new keyboard since all other methods to make it work again we’re not working. Therefore, they gave us a new keyboard and the fact that they were just so friendly, understanding, and helpful not to mention how fast they are is fantastic. Thank you!",2021,06
"Product quit working after using it for only a week, it would go on, then turn off while typing, not good when in the middle of a game",2021,06
Awesome,2021,06
Very short charge life also keyboard was hard to use,2021,06
"This is a good rechargeable keyboard that holds a charge for a long time. You can still use the keyboard when it is plugged into a USB port for charging. Placement of keys is taking some getting used to, in particular the enter key. As a touch typist I find myself hitting wrong keys when I should be connecting with the enter key. Frustrating",2021,06
"It's an awesome keyboard for any budget build ,rgb lights are great comes with different modes for the lights ,it's quiet and they have amazing customer support !",2021,06
"Ive had this about a year, the key board worked great...if the receiver is infront of my pc...(my keyboard is only ever 2-3 ft away. it has  slowly come to thiscurrently a foot and a half away and i have to pick it up to type while it's plugged in to bring it closer.""ths sna sewt rendem""is what was received while trying to say "" this is only a somewhat recent development""",2021,06
"The keyboard is quiet and the backlight is really nice. The keyboard is functioning correctly, as I am typing the review right now. However the design itself has some problems.If I were to describe the feeling of typing on it, it feels somewhat sticky, as though I am typing into quicksand. This is likely because for the design to be quiet, it blunts the speed of key pressing and returning to its original position. Honestly wouldn't have minded the noise if it meant a better typing experience, as it feels like I'm actually expending effort to type. each. key.The charger port also has issues with the male USB-C cable plugging in. It has lots of resistance and only goes in like 2 mm with exposed metal when the charge is active.All in all, I think the keyboard is nice and the bluetooth feature is a godsend, but the quality is pushing the envelope in satisfaction.",2021,06
Very quiet and comfortable. Great response time.,2021,06
Connects easy and the keys type well. Well made and not heavy if you need to travel with it.,2021,06
Definitely not quiet at all other then that’s it’s okay I guess,2021,06
"This is the first fancy keyboard I've bought, and it's worth it. I use it mainly for my TV when I connect my laptop to it. The range seems to be pretty far too.",2021,06
"Great keyboard! Connects quickly to PC, and the battery last a decent amount of time. The only thing I wish it had that it doesn’t would be that the light constantly stays on, but unfortunately it does not. Not a big deal though. The first keyboard they sent to me was not registering every key I pressed, but it was never specific to any specific keys. I contacted customer support regarding the issue and after having me run a few tests, they determined the keyboard was defective and sent me a new one within two days! Great company",2021,06
This keyboard is easy on the eyes and very responsive; you can also drop it and spill water on it and it just keeps on ticking.,2021,06
I love this keyboard,2021,06
"Alright. I purchased this product about 2 years ago and it has gotten regular use. Over all, for what it is, it is a good product for a good price.I do wish there was an option to dim or turn off the LED lights when using the keyboard but that's a fairly small issue.My one frustration is this: There is no place on the keyboard to store the wireless dongle. The slot it comes packaged in is just a rectangular hole in the back of the board with tape over it. Once it is unpackaged and getting used regularly, not having a place to lock the dongle in to the keyboard when transporting it creates a risk of losing the tiny little BT dongle...which is exactly what happened to me when I moved my home office.So I was without use of this keyboard for about 2 weeks.The good news is that when I contacted KLIM they were happy to mail out a new dongle free of charge. In fact, the first one they sent got lost in the mail so they happily sent a second replacement free as well (and tracked the package this time).So. The product is middle of the road and could use some engineering improvements but it's worth the money.And more importantly the customer service is 5-star.",2021,06
Everything. Sumply best keyboard ever,2021,06
"Love it, stays charges for a good long while.",2021,06
"UPDATE: 129 days later and the receiver has started to experience an internal fault. It is loosing connection with my pc, and acting as if I removed the receiver from the USB port. Windows is even playing disconnected chime. Moving to a new port does not fix the problem. It uses windows drivers, so there's no update. It seems to have started about a week after the last version update. I am running windows 10 version 21H1. Maybe it needs a firmware update? Also if you go to the website listed for support in the US. They don't have any electronics on the site. Only outdoor gear. Confusing!! Plus it's NOT 24/7 support. They are only open 8-5 mst.Pros: I will start by saying that I appreciate that the charging port is C type. That makes it easier to charge given that most pc electronics are going that way. The battery lasts about a week between charges for me, with about 2 hours of use per day. It's also a lot more responsive than my old wireless logi**ch keyboard. Like I noticed a difference in rocket league immediately! Backlight is ok. I have it set to solid and med bright.Cons: It's not TRUE RGB backlight. There are only 2 options for color on the lighting. Wave or solid on. It's just different color LEDs in the backlight.The keyboard layout is also different from my old keyboard. The enter key is tall instead of double key width. So when I type, I end up hitting the ' key instead of enter. And when you're in a game, short on time. You don't need missed keys.If you want an RGB keyboard. This is not the one you want.If you want a responsive wireless keyboard with multicolor backlight. This might be the one for you.",2021,06
Feels very light weight and doesn't sit tight.  If you touch type you will most likely find this unsuitable for daily fast moving entry.,2021,06
"It is a very nice keyboard. The feel is soft yet mechanical. Battery charge time seems sufficient. And the rgb is a perfect brightness-and at 40$ I did not expect any color/brightness control so that is sufficient in my eyes as well.It needs a better feeling charging port. it does not feel like it connects or goes in all the way. The cord is a severe charging restriction. in other words, if you use it to charge a phone, the phone will charge in slow charge mode.  but maybe it is on purpose to keep the batteries from overheating? I suggest making sure to use only that cord for it.  The keys are a little ""squishy"" for extended use. But over time and use I suspect that will wear away and leave a light feeling touch which will be decent for gaming and typing.",2021,06
Works as expected wish is nice because the refurbished one did not.,2021,05
"Might not be ideal for gaming because of the lag, but works perfectly for 95% of the situations. One charge lasts 2-3 days of very heavy usage, so it's convenient. At the time of my purchase this was the only wireless backlit proper keyboard, and I'm still happy with the purchase.",2021,05
I love my new keyboard! I love that the keys are not flat. The best part is they light up! It makes typing so much easier! Those that complain about the space bar being loud it isn't if you hit it in the middle. I have had no issues and my typing is way better than the flat one I was using. It is very comfortable to type and doesn't take up a lot of space. Perfect!,2021,05
"Amazing keyboard, I use it everyday and holds a great charge",2021,05
Great looking gaming keyboard. I brought this for my son as a starter,2021,05
"Never got to actually use this for real. My computer wasn't built when I initially bought it but It was functional, at least with my laptop but soon as I was ready to use it on my desktop it won't work for anything. The only reason I am giving this more than a star is the seller at least tried and replaced this receiver when I thought that was the problem but unfortunately, this is a cheaply made keyboard and basically, you get what you pay for. Don't expect robust quality with this thing",2021,05
For the price i got this product so far is the best i got in long long long time.... I use to use microsoft always but i was loosing my time... I love that is wireless and i can take woth my everywhere i go.,2021,05
Nothing special lights fall asleep within 20 seconds of not touching the keyboard not worth the buy I’m sure you can find better for your money,2021,05
Worked for four months but then stopped. Seems like it stopped recharging.,2021,05
Stopped working completely after a couple months. Won't charge. Useless.,2021,05
Bought this for my husband and he loved it! The lighting is bold/clear and the keys are soft to the touch. Easy installation. He was gaming in no time!,2021,05
"It's pretty, if it only worked...",2021,05
"Keeps losing signal in the keys ,even with the cord in! Doesn't stay charged long ,bad for gaming !",2021,05
"Do not use this keyboard if you are a programmer and need the backslash key often. Typically this key is to the right of the ""close bracket"" key, instead its 1 row lower. This requires you majorly change how you code. You can't even remap the key to something else, simply because theres no other key to remap it to.",2021,05
The rechargeable battery died in 8 weeks: i had to keep the power plugged in.and then last night it started i malfunction and typing erroneous things.Absolute junk. Don't buy it!,2021,05
"Pretty cheap keyboard,  not really mechanical at all.",2021,05
" I cannot type in frequently for no reason. When it’s not working, it’s connected with PC for sure because tab+alt was working. But others, like “space” “enter” “delete” and A-Z 0-9 all have no reactions. I’m using my phone to write this review because I can’t type in “Amazon.com” in my browser. If it only happened 1 time, that’s fine. The problem is it happened several times. So frustrated!",2021,05
The keyboard wouldn't even charge or stay on. You could charge it all day too watch it die in seconds the moment I turned it on,2021,05
Keys don't always work right love the lighting effect though,2021,05
ProsCharge lasts a LONG timeColorfulLooks cool on my deskConsThe return key is like a hundred miles away so you have to stretch your pinky out to hit return,2021,05
Lights were nice but one of the keys was broken,2021,05
Great keyboard my son loves it,2021,05
I like this keyboard it last longer than my mouse. This keyboard last 4 days for me before charging,2021,05
"Incredibly inconsistent keyboard, regularly misses strokes, and DOES NOT WORK WITH BASIC WINDOWS SHORTCUTS. Anything requiring a press of Left Ctrl and shift DOES NOT WORK. Dont waste your money",2021,05
"I like the adjustable backlighting, the way the keys feel and how quiet they are.  Most of all, I like the KLIM technical support.  I had trouble coordinating the Chroma keyboard with the Blaze mouse because of interference.  KLIM responded very quickly and their very first suggestion worked!  I appreciate quality products and just as importantly, prompt, friendly and effective technical support!",2021,05
"Battery life is long, black lighting is really nice, and key typing noise is nice, not too loud. Also a good price. would recommend.",2021,05
Just wasn't what I wanted. I  should have read the reviews about how it's always going to be different colors and it's like typing on cone shaped keys.Worked great. Nicely made. Just not for me.,2021,05
"The keyboard will randomly stop working. I could be typing okay, then it'll lose connection, and nothing I type comes up. Random letters will stop working, then start again after tapping the key multiple times. Disappointing.",2021,05
nice product,2021,05
Pleased overall with the exception that the volume control doesn't work with my MAC desktop,2021,05
Matte finish is nice. Keyboard feels of good quality. LEDs are only on when in use. Goes to sleep after 30 seconds or so. Very quiet. Great packaging and it comes with cool stickers.,2021,04
Work great for what I got it for,2021,04
"Not going to lie. I'm not particularly impressed with this keyboard. The reaction time is not all that great, but what is Really annoying is that there is no warning when the battery is low, so you can be playing a game and suddenly it stops working. Also no way that I have found to tell how charged it is",2021,04
"I love the keyboard...I just wish there was a switch to keep the lights on while using it but I actually understand that it would require it to be charged more...so either way, I love the freaking keyboard...it made my work life a little more simplified.",2021,04
very very bad  stay away -,2021,04
Nice gaming keyboard for the price.,2021,04
This was a great find for me. I have an ergonomic computer desk that raises to standing as needed.  The keyboard drawer is not wide and other keyboards hung out the back and front. This one fits fine and still feels like (as it is) a regular keyboard.I like the indicator lights (Caps/NumLock/etc) are well lit when on and the technicolor backlighting is nice to see - and let's me know everything is working.,2021,04
Not actually “wireless” in the way Mac users need it still requires a port for a dongle which makes it not Mac compatible,2021,04
"I wasn't looking to spend the amount of money I did one this unit, but I'm really glad I did. Even though it's not the most ergonomic keyboard, it serves its purpose and does exactly what I need it to do. Not to mention that the lights (which light up the letters very well) make it easier to find some of the lesser known and used keys. Plus it uses the same USB C charger that everything else uses. Win-win.",2021,04
Love how the colors light up when using it!,2021,04
This is a great keyboard and I really enjoyed it.,2021,04
"This KLIM would likely be an incredible gamer's keyboard - which is what it's made for.It's sturdy & has a cool multi-colored backlight. So as long as you're young and/or can type without looking at the keys, you'll probably love it!I wanted a backlit bluetooth keyboard for my laptop, but the KLIM's multicolor backlighting made the keys appear inconsistent, and so were difficult to read (the top characters of some keys didn't light up as well as the bottom ones on the same key).  And I found  the different colors simultaneously left to right across the board added a 'variability' to the characters that impacted their legibility for me.I ended up keeping a seenda, much thinner and flatter, w adjustable backlighting in a choice of several colors - but only one at a time, so the keys were consistently bright, sharp and clear.",2021,04
"Great keyboard! Slim, durable, long lasting battery, great connection. I bought other brands and returned them all, this is the best wireless keyboard.",2021,04
"Colorful, quiet keystrokes. Unfortunately, this is the second one I've purchased in less than 3 months after spilling water on the first one. It died a slow death. <sad face>",2021,04
"This keyboard worked for 5 months.One day it just stopped working. I walked away to get a drink came back, and none of the keys worked. It would light up for a second and turn off. Tried trouble shooting, resetting, and nothing helped.",2021,04

"This keyboard was great for a while. It’s definitely good for the cost. However, after two years the battery is constantly dead and the keys are not registering. I really wish it actually lasted longer. I don’t use it for gaming only for office work.",2021,04
Incompetent customer service actually really bad is a proper word the keyboard is not waterproof and overall it’s not worth the money,2021,04
"USB device failed after 3 months. It was working great before that, the device  now is not recognized by my PC. I have tried every form of trouble shooting I could find online, without success.",2021,04
it's ok. i wished the lighting stayed on w/o going into sleep mode.,2021,04
"It does it job for the price. If you can spend a little extra for something better, go for it. But if u need strapped for cash, it’ll do.",2021,04
Package arrived very quickly! Keyboard was charged when I got it and just had to plug in the dongle and it worked just fine. Keys are soft but not too much so. And pretty quiet. The multi color backlight looks cool! Very happy with my purchase!,2021,04
Great for price.,2021,04
The led lights are nice.  I have tried it out it's a good keyboard no problems yet,2021,04
Not sure why but this keyboard worked fine for about 10 months and then POOF - no more.  Just wouldn't connect to my Windows PC at all.  Before that I would have given it 3.5-4 stars as it had the RETURN button in a weird placement compared to standard keyboards and it did seem to need charging more frequently than I would have liked.,2021,03
"I am super impressed and very happy to receive an replacement key board over 15 months after I made the purchase. Their Customer Service Staff is very attentive and went over trouble shoot procedures with me.When that did not help, they have arranged for an replacement which I have received a few weeks ago.I will definitely stay with the brand.I gave 4 stars to rate ""Gaming"" performance because I did not use for gaming.I will definitely give 5 + Stars for their customer services because they do care.Good show.",2021,04
I've had this keyboard for a while and it finally ran out of battery. To my surprise it doesn't charge at all. Tried different chargers and nothing works. Spend a little more and get a product that doesn't just die forever the first time it runs out of juice.,2021,04
Amazing customer service. We had an issue with one keyboard and they sent a new one with great efficiency and highest level customer service.,2021,04
I wanted to like this keyboard but 3 months old and it's dead.  Battery life wasn't anywhere near the advertised time.  Be prepared for a dead keyboard after couple hours playing time.,2021,04
"I am not a great typist. This keyboard has a terrible problem keeping up with the typist. I have used it several times for word processing and spreadsheet applications on my PC. Because I look at the keyboard when I type I find out after  a minute or so of typing I look up and find over a third of what I typed is full of missed letters, entire words are missing, parts of words are run together.  The keyboard just doesn't register all of my keystrokes. I have even tried slowing down and being even more deliberate about my touches on the keystrokes. Same result. Sending this back for sure.",2021,04
"Product didn't work straight out of the box.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to use the product within the return window, so out the cost of the product.  Never could get it to connect even though we followed the troubleshooting guide downloaded from the manufacturer.  Light came on when you typed, but nothing every showed on the screen.  Not impressed though with the 4 hour charge use stated on the box.  For that you might as well get a wireless unit with batteries.",2021,04
"These people have been wonderful to work with.  I purchased the keyboard and it stopped working.  The keyboard stopped communicating with the small USB plugin.  I sent them an email letting them know and the replied quickly, gave me some suggestion to try.  I did so but it still did not work.  They were so kind and send me a new keyboard right away.  It came in a very short period of time and then followed up with me as to if I received the keyboard and was there anything else they could do for me.  They were wonderful.  I would not hesitate to purchase from them.",2021,04
Awesome...  I’m buying another one for my smart TVs...,2021,04
"Feels durable, and not fragile like the others. Worth the couple extra bucks over a Victsing.",2021,04
"It's just okay for me. It isn't so quiet that I would recommend it for a quiet office, but it's quieter than standard keyboards. The lighting effects are alright, but they go to sleep after only a few seconds and there's no way to modify that. There's also no way to see the remaining battery power that I've found yet. It was easy to setup, but it's worth noting that plugging the keyboard in with the charging cable doesn't actually connect it to the PC, so you still have to have the wireless receiver plugged in, taking up an additional USB slot. Overall the keyboard just doesn't impress me. I've got a half dozen other boards I've tried and I I'll probably try a steel-framed, ""quiet,"" mechanical keyboard next.",2021,04
"I picked this keyboard since it's one of the few out there that still have the old school design with a big tall Enter button instead of the wide one. I was very pleasantly surprised with how nice typing feels and how quiet it is. These were the main requirements I had and I'm happy to say it ticks all boxes.I only wished it operated with replaceable batteries as those tend to last longer in my experience. Instead it has you charging the built in battery with a cable, which lasts about 2 weeks before needing to recharge it. But that was my fault for not paying attention to the description. Other than that, I noticed the space key is slightly louder than the rest of the keys, but really this is just nit-picking and not noticeable when typing normally.Overall, really very happy with my purchase.",2021,04
"Keyboard went out when a drop of coffee landed on the space bar, turned upside down and blew it out, half the keys don't work now.",2021,04
Very nice keyboard fast shipping,2021,03
" Awesome keyboard! Only issue I have with it is super minor. The space bar key is so loud!! All the other keys are just fine. The space bar just doesn't have enough connectors for its length, so it makes a really loud click.",2021,03
"It's a nice laptop, but I won't say it's for hardcore gamers. The backlight stays rainbow colored and will turn on after a few seconds of non-use which makes it difficult to use it in the dark. I have to hit the spacebar just to turn the lights back on and that's annoying. The wireless feature is nice and I've had no real issues other than the light problem.",2021,03
It’s very nice,2021,03
"Feels amazing to type with, just wish battery life was longer",2021,03
Item didn’t come with dongle then when the dongle was sent still didn’t work in any computer highly advise on not buying,2021,03
Sleep mode is non-adjustable.You cannot use ctrl + shift OR ctrl + alt functions because the keyboard won't register 3 simultaneous keystrokes involving ctrl.This is the first ever product I've returned the day I received it.,2021,03
The keyboard worked fine for a short while. Then the battery would lose its charge and while it is charging it would heat up the keyboard input area that it burnt my finger. It finally died on me the other day so I threw it away. Just for fyi I was using their charging cord.,2021,03
"Quiet typing, no latency. Only issue is that it doesn't stay charged for long, stays charged for about 3-4 days., and light doesn't show when it needs to be charged. Other than that, it is a pretty good  Keyboard.",2021,03
"Great keyboard. Comfortable. Wireless transponder is solid, haven’t had any connectivity issues. Charges quickly, can be used while charging as long as the charging cord is plugged into the wall not a computer.",2021,03
first one I received would not stay connected wire less wired was no better Amazon sent replacement that worked right out of the box thank you amazon,2021,03
"Just doesn't connect. Also doesn't come with instructions except lousy ""troubleshooting"" that essentially just says to restart your computer and try plugging it into other devices. Sure, let me grab all my other computers. Also, no tech phone tech support and it's not really silent. Bye.",2021,03
Thanks,2021,03
"I'm very happy with the keyboard I got. It was well packaged and is very easy to use. I do enjoy the minimal sound and the texture of the keys, the only key that is a bit harsh on the fingers in the space bar but the rest is very nice and smooth. The lights go off whenever the keyboard is not in use.",2021,03
"If you want a great keyboard without the high price then this it. It is quiet unless you pound the keys. I don't know how long the charge last as I charge it at night. The keyboard is spill proof. I spilled coffee on it and after drying all night it was working great again. The seller was quick to respond to email about it not working after spilling and told what to do, which I had already done. They stated they would stand by warranty but didn't need it. As for adjusting the lightening, I haven't tried as I like it as it is. I would recommend buy a wrist support for keyboard. I got one for about $11 that included one for keyboard and mouse on Amazon.",2021,03
I recommend it,2021,03
"The keys have an unusual silky feet that I kinda like, unexpected. I like the ability to see the keyboard in total darkness and love the colorfulness of it. I like the key selection and the ability to adjust volume even if the screen is off. Nice keyboard.",2021,03
Not worth the money at all. It’s just a standard keyboard that slides all over the place and occasionally lights up. Missing grips and the lights won’t stay on longer than 15 seconds which is why I wanted it in the first place for when I’m working at night. Pointless,2021,03
I love it just as pictured works great,2021,03
"I purchased this keyboard 5 months ago.  It performed well for the price, but it just died for no reason at all.",2021,03
Very good product love the way it lights up. Charges very easy and battery last a long time before recharge.,2021,03
"Keys stop responding after a few weeks. I contacted the manufacturer, tried to fix but no luck. I received a replacement, and again within 20 days keys don't respond. Incredibly frustrating. I do not recommend this product.",2021,03
Lightweight. Amazing customer sevice.,2021,03
This keyboard looks good on my desk and is very good for coding.,2021,03
"Great keyboard - nice, slim, colorful, works well.Customer service is outstanding - company really wants to ensure satisfaction.",2021,03
"Compact, slim and well light.  Recharges quickly when drained completely. Comes out of sleep mode in the blink of an eye.",2021,03
"I purchased this keyboard in May of 2020.  I just had to get rid of it because it just slowly stopped working.  Nothing was spilled, or dropped, or anything like that, and it just quit working.",2021,03
My boys loved it for xbox and playstation,2021,03
Stepson loved it,2021,03
This keyboard went from being usable for a couple of days without a charge to having to stay connected permanently,2021,03
"When I first got this keyboard, I noticed that my passwords were often wrong, though I knew I had typed them correctly.  Missing keys started showing in browsers and and applications, alike.  There was no rhyme or reason to it.  About 1 of 25 key strokes just didn't appear.  Sometimes, angrily pressing the same key 3 or 4 times in a row produced no result.I thought that it might be low battery, without the warning light.  Even when I left the USB cable plugged in all the time, performance did not improve.  If you use this keyboard for gaming, you will suffer lots of premature death.  If you use it for work, you will suffer crippling frustration.  I am using mine as a paper-weight, having switched back to an old Dell keyboard that came with my tower PC 10 years ago.The battery life did not impress, even with the brightness somewhat muted.The tactile feedback is poor, too.  It just always had an un-satisfying feel.",2021,03
One of the best wireless keyboards I've had so far.,2021,03
Pretty good entry level keyboard. The only thing I have a complain about is there is no option to have the keyboard stay awake for longer then what seems like 30-45 seconds. Having to wake it up constantly is annoying.,2021,03
in theory this is a good keyboard but impractical practical use it’s just not it dies  way too often And I am a video editor I cannot have those kinds of problems time is money,2021,03
Works great,2021,03
I like the weight of the board and the key action. I only wish you could change the lighting,2021,03
"Sleep mode turns off the keyboard after1 minute and when it's dark it gets to be annoying. I wish it was adjustable but it's not, 2 minutes would be better. Other than that, it works great.",2021,03
I like the keyboard it works great the battery life is pretty decent has low button noise soft button presses i just wish it would take longer for it to go into sleep mode and if there were different light up options to choose from but all in all a pretty good product.,2021,03
"I have nerve damage in my hands so this keyboard is great in the fact that you can see, hear and ""feel "" the keys.  Also being lit up helps to find the key so much faster. I've had it two weeks or so and no complaints.",2021,03
This keyboard is great for gaming but when I got this It came with 1 downside is that my space bar was squeaky not too loud but definitely noticeable but later down the road with the keyboard it’s just a recommendation to the product is at a red light for the battery light so you can tell if it is low cause I could be gaming and it does with no sort of warning but overall great product it works amazing,2021,03
"The keys are responsive and the multi-colored back-lighting is an attractive feature. The rechargeable battery lasts a long time and charges very quickly.  Though I had a small issue, KLIM customer service was really very helpful! I heartily recommend this keyboard.",2021,03
DO NOT BUY -keyboard went dead - 48 hours after returnability date.,2021,03
Great product and price. Customer service is professional and timely!,2021,03
Lights look great & last long!,2021,03
"Seriously the worst keyboard I've used in 25 years of pc gaming. INCLUDING novelty keyboards, micro keyboards that fit in one hand, keyboards from the 90's with the pin conectors. This keyboard shuts off and disconnects from the dongle often and repeatedly. Even with a clear los of the dongle it will NOT stay connected. ONLY buy this keyboard if you want your character to just stand there and die while you furiously mash buttons. I though that by putting a couple more dollars in than the minimum I could avoid products like this but I am DISGUSTED with the product quality here. I would return this product if I didn't intend to SMASH it with a hammer when I but an upgrade this week, in a sick attempt to reach some sort of closure on how AWFUL this products is. DO NOT BUY THIS KEYBOARD.",2021,03
Great product quality!!!,2021,03
Low quality not worth more than $15.  Led lighting is fixed colors.,2021,03
"The keypad tends to leave off some letters after prolonged use. I had to keep retyping some letters. And in some cases, it actually doubled up on the letters. The charge doesn't last long either. All in all I am somewhat satisfied with it but I believe it has a few inherent flaws.",2021,03
Great,2021,03
Nice key stroke but battery life could be improved a bit,2021,02
I like that its wireless and the keyboard works like a charm!,2021,02
"Love the keyboard in every way except when I am using it and suddenly, even in the middle of a game, it stops working completely, and needs to be charged.  It won't work while charging either.  You have to wait for it to be done.  If you can get on a schedule you're good.",2021,02
"The keyboard feels great, looks great. But it's not nearly special enough for how often it needs to be plugged in. It has died on me in the worst situations. Never any sort of warning, and happens roughly once every 2 weeks. Would much rather have a hardwired or battery operated keyboard than this. Battery life is frankly unacceptable",2021,02
Works great and as expected 👍.,2021,02
This is a great buy and they have amazing customer service so i had to buy this wireless keyboard especially for my second monitor. Lastly it lasts very long like 7 days long.  My only wish is for hair trigger like keys for rhythm games or fps but other wise a great buy.,2021,02
The klim chroma is an excellent gaming  keyboard for the price!,2021,02
"I bought two of these as gifts a couple of christmases ago. I just recently found out both recipients lost their USB Receivers. KLIM Support quickly mailed both recipients out new USB Receivers FREE of charge, even after the warranty had been expired. I can't speak for product itself, but KLIM Support is top notch. I will buy from KLIM again.",2021,02
The back light is very nice! Some of the top keys don't have the clearest numbering/lettering but if you know where the keys are this is very minor. I wish the back light had an adjustable sleep timer. One charge lasts a long time and you can still use the keyboard while it's plugged in for charging. The charging cable isn't very long but can easily be combined with a usb extension cord.The ergonomic design and curved keys offer comfort during many hours of use.,2021,02
Worked only until I couldn’t return it anymore!!,2021,02
"Ive been looking for a nice keyboard for my custom built gaming/school/home use pc and I am more than pleased with this keyboard. Input lag is comparable to my logitech wired keyboard, and ive played Titanfall 2 with it, and I love it. Battery life seems great, as ive used this product all night and its still going strong. The keys are great, not quite as ratifying as a clicky mechanical keyboard, but very close. The backlighting is beautiful. The colors are clear and sharp but not overwhelmingly bright. The shape, key travel, and spacing make this keyboard an absolute pleasure to work/play with. Its lightweight, but sturdy, as you would actually have to put alot of force into bending or twisting the board to hurt it. Personally im certain that it would take ALOT of high drops onto concrete to actually hurt this thing. All in all, great product for a great price, and i stoked to have it, Ive actually typed this review with the keyboard!",2021,02
" The keyboard is nice and quiet and feels great to type on. The achilles heel is the space bar. Arguably the most used key on the board produces a cacophonous ""SMACK"" upon use. All the keys are silent but the space bar just want to wake the neighbors, it's very distracting.",2021,02
Works pretty good,2021,02
"This worked fine, but you can't change the lighting... But after about a week of use it shut off and is dead, even after charging every night. Batteries won't charge, lights won't come on. Checked the battery with a volt meter and it shows 0.4volts. It won't charge.",2021,02
"I do like the pretty lights and how you can easily use this keyboard in a dark room. OTOH, those pretty lights burn the batteries quite quickly, so it isn't really a wireless keyboard; it's best to keep it plugged in and charging most of the time. But that's true of basically all wireless lighted keyboards. The big problem I had was that it just never got along with my computer, a Mac running Big Sur. Several times a day I would have to unplug the wireless dongle, shut off the keyboard, and then plug in and power up again. Even then I sometimes had to restart the computer. After a week or so of that I gave up and returned the keyboard.",2021,02
great product for the money.,2021,02
My son digs it.  Works for playing fortnight on the ps4,2021,02
"My son loves it, Thank you.",2021,02
Space bar is loud in feels like it’s going to fall of and it’s to small,2021,02
"I bought this keyboard for my everyday use and I like it, the back lighting is cool. But suddenly the print on the keys is smearing and rubbing off! To be clear, my nails are very long and my fingerpads have never actually touched the keys! It is so odd that the print is smearing!",2021,02
Love this keyboard! Bought it twice for our second computer. We are not gamers but it’s nice for the computers and lights up nicely,2021,02
Also good for adults!!!! Nighttime joy!!!!,2021,02
It's light and works for a long time on battery power but the keyboard lighting leaves much to be desired,2021,02
"I have been using the keyboard for several months now for occasional gaming. I absolutley love how quiet it is. The connection is very easy, battery life long(i have only charged it once), and very comfortable to use. I wish the backlight stayed on longer though. I just bought another KLIM keyboard for work.",2021,02
"I wanted to get a wireless, backlit keyboard for my home PC, something I could use throughout my office without having to be directly next to my computer. This keyboard looks great, the keys themselves have nice travel for easy typing, and the charge lasts for a very long period of time, but the lack of an ""always on"" feature for the backlit is very annoying. I understand it always being on would kill the battery quickly, but this is a rechargeable keyboard, so losing some time to have to charge isn't a big deal. For me, it just feels odd that they wouldn't just add an always on function for those who would want that. I'm often reviewing other peoples work, or just reading through instructions, so I often don't type for 60 seconds at a time, so the lights are constantly going off. Again, I understand the reason, and it's not a huge problem, but it just feels like it would have been so easy to have an always on function added. Overall, good keyboard, but unfortunately for me it's just not a good fit for how I use my keyboard.",2021,02
Love,2021,02
"Very nice, very good for gaming and personal use, it’s been more than two months I been using and enjoying with this keyboard.",2021,02
"Not installed on my PC, but the user is pleased.  The lighted feature is worthwhile.",2021,02
"Bought as a gift for my son, he loves it!",2021,02
Great product. Would buy again. Love the lights.,2021,02
I never right a review but I had to help people save money and time. DO NOT buy this product... it sucks so bad it takes 2 min so you can type after freezing.,2021,02
"There are multiple times the keyboard does not register my keystrokes, causing typos in word-processing and issues when gaming. Defeats the purpose of having a keyboard IMO. It looks nice though...",2021,02
After maybe three months of use I started experiencing issues with it staying powered on and connecting to my PC. I would try typing and the keys simply wouldn’t work and would keep turning off. Overall my experience with this keyboard has been very poor and I don’t recommend it.,2021,02
"The keys are very soft when hitting which makes for a nice feel to a keyboard. I like that the sleep mode kicks in after a minute or so of no use, translating to a longer battery life before having to plug in and charge. The color does only stay at one spot, it doesn't breathe or anything. I Will update in couple of weeks if needed.",2021,02
"The ""G"" and ""H"" keys, sometimes the ""Z"" key and the ""ENTER"" key just stopped working TWO MONTHS after I bought this thing. I never leave reviews. But this is truly unacceptable. Do not buy, PERIOD.",2021,02
"This keyboards look nice and lighted up from the outside but when it comes to using it, it is very unreliable and will stop working on you unexpectedly. I bought this back in early Decemebr 2020. I soon I got it it was not connecting to my laptops.I made sure keyboard was fully charged and ready to go, and tested it on two different laptops and nothing. I reached out to their IT/customer service and said the dongle has stopped working and would send me another one in 10days. I had to wait 10days! for a replacement, mind you I am working from home and really giving this keyboard a chance. Dongle came, followed the intructions and reset the keyboard and it worked! This was by end of December. Its February 17 and it stopped working today! So far it lasted a little over a month before having the same issue all over again. This is a huge waste of time especially when having to work from home and having to stop and try to reset and test with multiple computers and still nothing. This time it can't be the dongle, when inserted it reads int he computer. I do not recommend!!!",2021,02
"When I received product I knew it was what I wanted.Nice raised keys, nice crisp click.  THEN (of course) after throwing awaythe box and packaging and really getting down to using it, irealized the CAP N key does not work!  URGH.  My mistake for sure.MAKE SURE YOU USE IT FOR A WHILE BEFORE DISCARDING ANYTHING!!!",2021,02
There is an input delay. When you press a key it takes a half-second to actually register which can make a huge difference in professional gaming.,2021,02
"I absolutely love this keyboard! I normally get just the regular wireless or plug-in but never again. I can type so much faster on this keyboard. It responds beautifully. Fewer typos, even, because it keeps up with me. And the cool lighting is a pleasing bonus!",2021,02
"So it's possible this is a good device. However, the keyboard/receiver combo I received is triple-malfunctioning: it lags excessively between input and recognition (tried all 6 USB ports to confirm), the sleep mode activates within seconds of disuse so even input tests are wonky, and receiving range is maybe 2ft at best.",2021,02
Grandson loved it for gaming.,2021,02
" This Keyboard is nice for the money. The colors are very cool and the keys are really quiet, however, the space bar is audibly loud when pressed and I find it distracting. Also they they have configured the return key different and put the back-slash key before the return key which has made the stretch harder. So every time I try and hit the RETURN key, I am hitting the forward- slash key., also very irritating. Normally that back-slash key is above the return key. I have attached video's and pictures of what I am talking about. I am not sure if I will keep it or not!",2021,02
Great keyboard. Not loud. Just wish more RGB settings,2021,02
Love this it’s so cool,2021,02
"Wow, what a great keyboard that makes typing fun.  Keys are well spaced - if you use shortcuts frequently, this will really help!  Does not feel cheap at all...the construction is top-notch and the key sound is an elegant ""clicky-pump"" sound.  As far as I can tell, RGB color pattern is the only color choice but many ways to tune the back-lighting effect to your taste.  Super happy with the purchase.",2021,02
Best keyboard for gaming. Works with Xbox consoles and PlayStation consoles as well. Battery life is amazing only charged it twice since and I only had it for 2 months. 10 out of 10,2021,02
"Good for my wireless gaming setup. Needed ergonomic rests to use it though. But it is a good keyboard with good rgb lights but I do wish sometimes that the lights stayed on. Hard to see the keys in my dark room sometimes when I get ready to use it, gotta click the wrong key to turn it back on to see which is right. But other than that, good response time, battery life and all. Would recommend",2021,02
Terrible stopped working within weeks. The keys have weak feedback & awkward placement of the enter key. Not to mention the weird noises the keyboard makes when the lights are on.,2021,02
Met all expectations.  Plug and play with no software installation.,2021,02
"Someone in my family asked for this product for a Christmas gift, so, after reading the great reviews, I bought it. She used it for one week, and it needed charged. After that, it wouldn't hold a charge for more than 10 minutes. After she told me this, I contacted the seller. They immediately responded and offered to send me another one if I was willing to send back the defective one. I am completely convinced that the one I received just had a defect. They were so easy to work with, and the replacement works perfectly.",2021,02
"The keyboard when it lights up makes a strange high pitched buzz. Hearing that none stop would definitely cause a headache. In addition the keys are very loud especially the spacebar. It does look pretty cool when lit, but there is no way I could have handled the buzz none stop.",2021,02
Broke inside my laptop. I had to remove it with tweezers. This was a Christmas gift. It didn’t last 30 days.,2021,02
Rechargeable!!,2021,02
"LED""s are dim and battery life is short so I need to plug in the keyboard more often than I'd like to. Other than that it meets my expectations.",2021,02
Wish the Keyboard #'s and letters were better lit ... Only has lighted background,2021,02
I don’t like how you can’t change the keycaps. I also don’t like how you have to click the middle of the space bar and can’t just click the side,2021,02
I'm a sucker for colors and needed a new key board. This one is it. Not only do I like the colors in the background but the comfort and style. It was a great buy,2021,02
Falls asleep entirely to quickly.  Midtyping and the keyboard is asleep.  Horrible for gaming as the lag is sometimes 3 to 6 seconds between a key being pressed and actually recognizing it was pressed.Customer support page contact seller brings up an ATV page and they dont help.,2021,02
Keyboard is small for the money.,2021,02
"I just recently got into using a mouse and keyboard for FPS games such as COD and this is my first keyboard. Overall good keyboard, keys are firm but press easy, some buttons are shaped different than usual but that makes it easier to use them, ie. The enter button. Sweet color display. Goes into sleep mode after about 2 minutes of not use to conserve battery but shoots right on as soon as you hit a button. Over good keyboard. Works with XBOX ONE",2021,02
"Only wish is that it had a battery meter, but it's otherwise a great purchase",2021,02
After 2 months it started missing key stokes or double entering letters. You would think it would last longer than 2 months before having issues like this. It is hard to respond quickly to things when you have to keep going back to correct words that are either missing letter or have too many letters. Quite disappointing. Time to find a new keyboard.,2021,02
"The Enter key is weirdly shaped, the back lights do not stay on unless i am typing and the F6 key sticks.  I use for work not gaming.  It is too much trouble to return but I will not buy again.",2021,02
I have had this keyboard for about a month and I love it. I have only had to charge it once and I love the adjustable lighting. I use this for my amateur gaming as well as for school. Amazing purchace!,2021,02
"I love the product, but I love the customer service even more. I had an issue with the USB (clearly my fault) and Lolita and her customer service team was truly amazing helping me to resolve the issue. The are all truly amazing, even sent me candy after a few weeks of putting up with me and assisting me with my wireless light up keyboard.",2021,02
"For starters,  the box came cut up, I dont know the reason anyone would have to cut pff a part of the product box, maybe im being paranoid, i dont know.  Also, as you can see on the pictures, the keyboard was totally dirty with dust, stains,  some minor scratches here and there, and what seems to be food crumbs under keys. Leads me to think this was being used already by seller previous to selling as brand new. Lights look cool amd it conmects fine to my Laptop, but the lack of hygiene is what got to me.  Dont buy!",2021,02
"I bought this keyboard because it seemed like a deal with the backlit and ""silent key"" features.  I found the backlit features to be almost irrelevant when using in the dark because the alternating and dark colors made it difficult to see.  I put ""silent keys"" in quotation marks because they're not really silent.  The keys felt no different than a basic keyboard that you can buy for $20-25.  If you're looking for good quality and can spend $15 more I suggest a Logitech.  That's why I immediately unhooked it and returned it so I can go back to buying the Logitech K800.",2021,02
Product died almost immediately after warranty period expired.  Will not charge or turn on.,2021,02
Great keyboard lights up  and works fine!!,2021,02
The colors are really neat and the keyboard is an awesome fit with my setup!,2021,02
Love this keyboard. Great addition to my studio and for recording in the dark 👌🏽🔥🙌🏽,2021,02
I have only had this a few days but so far is been good.  Haven’t had any connectivity issues. The space bar is rather loud for the keyboard being “silent” it’s the only key though. Over all great product for the price would recommend to friends or family.,2021,02
You may be thinking that you are typing everything as expected. Later you will realize that KB stopped typing or missing some characters in the middle of your writing.A worst buy from AMAZON -Dear AmazonDo not allow to tarnish your reputation.Customer trust is THE important factor for you right?Please help your customers - do a perfect quality test.,2021,02
"Bought this for my girlfriend, and she loved it, and then I wished I kept it for myself.",2021,02
Was happy at first to see the design of the product. But came to realize if I type to quickly the keyboard my miss the key letter you put in. It kept happening then I got my wireless work one and realize I don’t miss a beat. The klim keyboard I have seems to not be able to read at a fat pace when typing. That comes to me as a big issue.,2021,02
"The sleep mode is ridiculous. They stated the lights keep on 60 seconds and nit true, they stay a few seconds. Worst keyboard ever",2021,02
This keyboard is awesome. It also has a 5 year warranty which the company is very legit. My keyboard charger didn’t seem to work so they sent me a new one! With a candy! lol Thanks Klim!,2021,02
"My son loves the keyboard as an extension of his school laptop; he thinks the colors are cool and the ease of use is great. We had a slight problem with charging and I contacted the company; a real person responded to my inquiry very quickly. Their solution was efficient and thoughtful and my son was back to using his keyboard in a week. This was a good purchase, made better by the good customer service that backs it.",2021,02
Space bar and other keys were getting stuck and noisy.,2021,01
"For the price, a great keyboard. You can do a lot that you do with more expensive keyboards.",2021,01
"Honestly, the soft push of the keys feel weird. Maybe because I'm used to a laptop keyboard with very shallow keys and friends boards with more ""clicky"" keys. It doesn't feel satisfying to type with.Connectivity was super easy and the lights are nice. There is a slight buzzing sound from the lights, however.",2021,01
"Very nice keyboard specially for the prize, has a very nice feel, good button click. I use it for gaming.",2021,01
My son loves his keyboard.  Customer service through KLM is available and very thorough and helpful if needed.,2021,01
"There is just so much to dislike about this keyboard now that I have used it for awhile. First, there is no indication of battery status. Second, the on time before the lights turn off when inactive is too brief and not adjustable. Third, the battery life is very short, so it's easiest just to leave it plugged in, which defeats the purpose. Fourth, the action keys for sound don't connect to the computer and are therefore worthless. Fifth, it is obnoxious that there is a little divot in the enter key and the | \ key is tucked in there--it is far too easy to hit the backslash when you think you are hitting enter. Sixth, it is cheaply made and feels flimsy. I am ordering from someone else and will gladly dump this one in the trash.",2021,01
"It's a wonderful product! almost a month with it and I'm very happy, the benefit/cost relationship make it worth it.",2021,01
I'm very happy with the keyboard,2021,01
This keyboard can't hold a solid connection 5 feet away from the computer even at full charge.  Keyboard flickers on and off while I type. Customer support number is fake.BUYER BEWARE!,2021,01
"The left ctrl + shift cannot be combined with many shortcuts in browsers, such as Ctrl + Shift + I for developer mode.",2021,01
This keyboard matched the description and worked perfectly out of the box!  It runs on an internal battery that can be recharged from USB-C charging cable. The colors look good and the lights are adjustable. I would recommend this item and buy it again.,2021,01
Use this for gaming and its awesome!,2021,01
"Arrived with a broken button. Description says ""silent"" but keys are just as loud as a mechanical keyboard.",2021,01
"Likes - Works good for the price and is pretty good for a membrane keyboard. The battery seems to last quite a long time (didn't actually time it). The keyboard goes to sleep pretty fast to conserve battery life (also can be a con)Cons - This is why it is cheap so the cons are to be expected for a keyboard at this price point.1. The keyboard flexes2. The RGB is very limited, would of liked an option for a solid color.3. The keyboard shuts off even when plugged in (probably the biggest downside).4. The space bar is ""clacky"" and doesn't feel as solid as the other keys.If you want a decent keyboard that is fairly cheap and works as advertised this isn't a bad buy.",2021,01
I work at a place that supplies cheap basic keyboards and I splurged to make my workday better with something that makes me happy. ‘How did they let you order that/mine is crap etc.’ I bought it with my own money to make me smile with the rainbow at my finger tips! Muhaha love it!!,2021,01
"I've been pc gaming since the 90s. I'm not sure what makes this a gaming keyboard. There aren't any special keys for hot binding. The back lit keys look cool, but are completely useless if you know how to type. I'll keep my opinion on pc gamers who don't know the keyboard layout to myself 😉So far I haven't had an issue with key lag or battery life, but I just got it this week. I did make sure it was fully charged before I used it.Otherwise, it's just a basic wireless keyboard. It's not fancy, or special. So far it's done what I've needed it to do",2021,01
Exelente,2021,01
"Excellent feel but NO warning when battery about to die, which negates it for competitive gaming. Enter Key also has horrible design and placement.For work, the dongle does not work if using a KVM switch or if a direct line of sight is not allowed.  If you can snag a used one for less than new price, it may be worth it but I would not buy again.",2021,01
wanted a keyboard to work with by xbox360.  This works really well and I am glad I made the purchase.,2021,01
"YO!!! This keyboard is just simply awesome. One of the coolest keyboards I ever owned hands down. Love the feel of each button on the keyboard. Love the color scheme of the LED lights, can even see some of the LED lights like mixing with each other which I just find totally cool. The fact that this keyboard is wireless is just a plus for me. It is for sure not too overly clicky like other keyboards I had in the past, this one is more subtle but as well excellent to the touch. I guarantee your satisfaction with this keyboard and without a doubt recommend it to anyone wanting a new keyboard that is wireless or that is purchasing for the first time.",2021,01
"Very reactive, but not quite ""membrane"" and NOT as quiet as they claim. Took a minute to get used to how loud the space bar especially was. But LOVE the colors and how quick it wakes/sleeps. Holds a long charge and recharges quickly. I have carpal tunnels and this is easier on my hands than even my macbook air! Ergonomic and reactive!Granted, its not ""wake the family"" loud or anything, but far from silent. My favorite keyboard ever nevertheless.",2021,01
This company has absolutely amazing customer service! I ordered this keyboard and it stopped charging after about a month of using it so I contacted the company and they sent me a brand new one right away that works wonderfully  without a problem! I highly recommend!,2021,01
"I lost my usb receptor, i sent an  email requesting help and their customer Service rep (Lolita) helped me (They sent a new one for free)When i received they provided me the instruction to pair my receptor.100 points! Excelent ServiceKeyboard is awesome! Thanks KLM!",2021,01
"I was amazed at how light it is and requires no batteries, the functions of the keyboard are simple to use and having options for the lighting is awesome. A super comfy keyboard!On the flip side, I thought you could change the color settings but that's a no, it's not ""silent"" more than the character keys are quiet but the spacebar is a normal clicking sound and connecting it to a phone charger is preferred to plugging it into your pc to charge (the PC might get a bit confused.)A great product guys and I love the schwag!!!",2021,01
The keyboard is good but wish the battery last longer than a couple of days in stead of having to charge it every two days.,2021,01
"Worked fine for 3 weeks then let’s started randomly malfunctioning and getting stuck in the depressed position regardless of nothing being spilled on them, nothing stuck under key, etc. Frustrating issue for a brand new product",2021,01
"Pros:- Significantly cheaper- Backlit keys- rechargeable- looks good- sturdyCons:- off-brand name- keys feel a little plasticy- battery life is a little light (not bad, just don't expect it to last for weeks without charging).That's it. I've had two now after many logitech backlit wireless keyboards and for half the price or less, I can safely safe that Logitech (the ""big name"") is absolute garbage in comparison.",2021,01
"Works as described, love the lights!",2021,01
"Excellent product, works great as well as being affordable. Along with having great customer service.  Highly recommend for all people looking for a new keyboard.",2021,01
"The key board is great, it is exactly what I needed for my desk.",2021,01
"I was pretty happy with this keyboard, a bit louder than I wanted, but good.  just a couple weeks ago, maybe 8 months after purchase the keyboard cannot send typing commands to any computers.  It can turn on, light up, etc...  I have tired multiple cables, direct connection or RF usb connection, etc... nothing works.  I would suggest spending your money elsewhere.",2021,01
"Comfortable soft keys, great responsiveness and retraction.",2021,01
Overall the keyboard is good. It's smaller than I expected but overall is good. I've had it for about 2 months and the windows buttons isn't working anymore.,2021,01
"I used this keyboard for regular day to day use and gaming.First the left shift key failed after a few months... okay I thought ""I got another shift key..."".A couple of months later the top number one key failed, okay I thought again "" I got a number pad just no more exclamation points, fine I can't yell at people anymore!!!!..."".THEN the V key failed, now I know this is dumb but seriously my response was ""FINE ILL USE COPY PASTE FOR THE V!)""So I go to google and fine a v to copy [ CTRL+C ] Then I got to type and use paste....... [ CTRL+V ] ""SON OF A !@#$%!!!!!!""Please don't waste your money here! get a better keyboard for a few more dollars from a better manufacturer!You deserve better =) (also I'd just like to say vvvvvvvVVVVV!!!!!!!!!11111111)",2021,01
"I will be returning this. Overall, it's fine, but isn't what I need. If you aren't a fast typer, and don't use the ctrl+c and other functions like it, it will be good for you.There is a lag in the keys, and I frequently have to retype words because it misses letters as I type. It also has to be in direct ""sight"" of the usb, otherwise it doesn't work. The ctrl+c and other functions like it do not work, and I use these frequently. They also for some reason redesigned the keyboard so the backslash is where the enter key usually is, and the enter key is farther away. I have small hands as it is, so I cannot reach the enter key without picking up my hand which in inconvenient when I'm doing things like typing an essay. Finally, more of an aesthetic thing than anything, I do not like that the backlighting turns off without use. The colors are pretty, but I want them to stay on so I can still see the keyboard. I could understand it turning off after something like five or ten minutes of inactivity, but it turns off after a few seconds.I liked the idea of this keyboard, but it just won't work for me. It's lightweight, the colors are nice, the clack of the keys is the perfect volume, and I like that it has a battery light. But there are too many cons for me to keep it.",2021,01
Love it!,2021,01
This is exactly what I was looking for!,2021,01
Cool lights. My son loves it,2021,01
Not what I expected I hate the sleep feature only stays lit for a few seconds and there’s no way to by pass it wanted a lit keyboard so I can find the key I need in the dark also would not recommend for gaming as the key strokes don’t always register,2021,01
Great product,2021,01
"This is a good, quiet keyboard.I bought it because my wife and I share one living room, which is also where I write on my laptop.  Keyboard noise was driving her nuts.  Bought this wireless keyboard because it was advertised as quiet.  It really is quieter.  I made it even less noisy by putting a piece of towel under it.  That has really helped my marriage survive during the pandemic, cooped up together.The keyboard lighting is nice.  I prefer a lighted keyboard since I sometimes wake up, can't sleep, and start writing another chapter for a book that may someday be a bestseller.The keyboard charged up easily with the short USB cord (included).  The charge usually lasted one to two weeks between charging, even when I forgot to use the switch underneath to turn it off for the night.  When the battery died, the keyboard was instantly usable again as soon as I plugged it into the laptop.I have just one small grumble.  I'm a writer, not a gamer.  When I'm typing fast, I want a large ENTER button.  On this keyboard it is a little smaller in order to make room for a backslash key.  I find myself getting a lot of backslashes instead of new paragraphs.  This happened with a different keyboard a few years ago, which I threw away due to aggravation.  For this quiet keyboard, however, the configuration is not so aggravating.  For now, its quietness is terrific.Other than the extra backslash key, the keyboard action is NICE.  Feels great.  I can write for hours (when not interrupted by my dog).I hope this is helpful for someone.  Be well.",2021,01
Well It was good while it lasted for a year but I will never buy an off brand wireless gaming keyboard again. Battery sucks on this keyboard.  I had to charge it at least once a week. It was so annoying that I just left the cable on the keyboard which defy the purpose of getting a wireless keyboard.  Then the keyboard would start having weird behavior.  It would freeze up or if I type it would get stuck on a letter and repeat it 30 times.  I'm so done with this junk.  FYI: I rarely used this keyboard for gaming.  I only use it for everything web surfing.  I need the illuminated light cause my work space is dark.,2021,01
Worked for a very few days then crapped out all together. My bad for buying a ‘bargain’ keyboard. I’ll stick with Logitech from now on.,2021,01
"nice packaging counts for little when the instruction manual tells you nothing about how to use it. I had to go to youtube! also for touch typists, you may find it too soft/quiet. returned",2021,01
"The key board has very cheap construction. It has a major hardware flaw where ctrl+shift keyboard combinations do not function properly from the left side of the keyboard. It is much smaller than my previous Logitech wireless keyboard that broke. The cord it comes with is way too short, so I had to spend another $10 buying a longer cord. The RGB lighting effects are very sub par. They don’t stay on continuously and only have one alternate effect of breathing, otherwise the color effect is stationary and never moves. The keyboard is so light if wants to slide when using it, so you might also have to buy a keyboard pad. Next time, I think I’ll spend and extra $40 for a better ergonomic quality gaming keyboard.",2021,01
this keyboard is the best keyboard i ever owned. my gaming have been better with it. if you want own a keyboard KLIM is the best.,2021,01
"I don't do gaming, I really just wanted a lighted keyboard I could use with my home theater setup.  This one does the job.  But after six months the on/off switch developed a problem so I contacted the company about the issue.  They responded really fast, and bent over backward to supply me with a satisfactory solution.  Super nice folks, too.  Recommended.",2021,01
"Great keyboard, easy to use in the dark, But I wish it has a screen light option to turn down or up the screen brightness, but it just has the brightness of the keyboard :/The battery last like 4-5 days, no indicator to tell you it's dying, it just shuts off :(but it does tell you its charging yay :PGot to get used to the Ergonomic, like all things.",2021,01
returned,2021,01
great quality.. came quick.. happy as can be,2020,12
"Looks great!  Feels great!  Unfortunately, doesn't completely work.  While some keyboard shortcuts work, many are missing.  The biggest omission for me, was ""CTRL + S"".  Who doesn't use the save shortcut?!  I literally use it every few minutes as I'm working.  I checked the reviews before purchasing and chalked it up to user error, but nope, you literally can't use the save shortcut.  That's a dealbreaker for me.  I do not recommend this keyboard if efficiency is your thing.",2021,01
"It was great while it lasted. 1.5 days before the wireless receiver failed. The keyboard itself still turns on and has lights though, so there is at least that going for it.",2021,01
Really like for gaming,2021,01
had for less than a month and will not work- keeps turning off,2021,01
So far this holds a decent charge and its really nice for my WAH job that requires tons of typing. The space bar makes a weird squeaking noise but other than that I love this.,2021,01
"Purchased for a fourteen year old for gaming, but it stopped working after less than a month of use.",2021,01
Cant wait to do business with u again thanks again,2021,01
Waaay to light. flies off desk at angular touch and there is nowhere to grip if and when you want to move it without touching a key and messing up processes..,2021,01
"The keyboard looked okay at first. I was a little sad that the rgb was not dynamic, but I thought I could live with that. Then I realized there was a major flaw when trying to do anything with it. There is literally no “B” key on the keyboard. I couldn’t even type this review on this keyboard or type the word “Keyboard”.",2021,01
I spend 10-16 hrs on the computer a day for work and gaming. This is the best keyboard on the market.Not only that my Windows key stopped working. I tried troubleshooting but I thought it was broke. I opened up a support case with KLIM support and within the hour they replied with a thorough set of troubleshooting ideas.  Turns on there is a Windows key lock that my 3 year old little guy turned on.AMAZING SUPPORT! I'll only be buying KLIM products moving forward.,2020,12
"The keys are very easy to type on, but I hate how the keyboard has a positive tilt built in. This is bad for one's wrists.",2020,12
Lights up well and feels great on your fingers. Lost a star for not being able to have the lights constantly on. Always goes to sleep and just a little inconvenience when the keys are black 😅,2020,12
"very nice look and colors, worked for 5 minutes unplugged then stopped and wont work plugged in either, tried letting it charge for days and still wont work",2020,12
"I bought this for my daughter who is a science teacher and is on her feet teaching a lot.  The portability of this keyboard and the fun colors has helped her keep pace with her middle school age students, keep them engaged and keep some of the fun in learning.",2020,12
The blacklighting is not nearly as bright as i had hoped. I don't feel like its worth $40 honestly but I like the slight grip on the keys.,2020,12
"My grandson loves this, he says it works great. He is a gamer, so he loves the lights and feel of the keys I’m told, great price, value, gift",2020,12
while typing a high pitch humming comes from the charging port area that only goes away when the keyboard goes to sleep. other than that the keyboard spacebar after long extensive typing starts to wear off and the spring becomes more audible.,2020,12
"This keyboard is nice and works perfectly. The only thing I don't like about it is that you don't have the option to keep the lighting on. Especially at night or playing games I end up fiddling around finding out where I am on the keyboard. I will keep it for a backup, but I think I will be looking for something with more lighting options.",2020,12
ok,2020,12
after a month it started to double type and miss keystrokes.,2020,12
"I love this keyboard. I love that it’s wireless. It came charged so I plugged it into my child’s computer and they were able to use it right away. I love that it’s fairly quiet typing. The backlight goes off quickly which I think is good because it saves battery. The one thing I personally don’t like is the placement of the “return” key and the “backslash” key. I’m used to the “backslash” key being above the “return” and the “return” key being more horizontal. Super small detail that is taking time for me to get used to, but I would still recommend this keyboard because it’s great overall.",2020,12
My son loved it to play video games!,2020,12
Bought this for my work computer and it is great...I love that it lights up when in use; makes it easier for me to read the keyboard.,2020,12
This keyboard feels really smooth and the rainbow backlit feature works really well. I highly recommend this keyboard to those looking for a wireless keyboard that they want to use for gaming or for other reasons.,2020,12
"Received as a gift and wanted to love it, but the hot keys issue is real. The ctrl and shift keys on the left side cannot be used together. As a programmer, can't live without hot keys like this. Select text to end or beginning of documents, uppercase or lowercase words, etc. Many editors use these hot keys 😥",2020,12
"My nephew loved it, he feels like a gamer using it.",2020,12

Very nice keyboard,2020,09
"While I absolutely love the product, it’s the customer service that stands out the most! When I had issues with my keyboard, this company was more than willing to help me out. They went above and beyond to make sure I was happy and had my keyboard working. The keyboard is beautiful and waterproof, which is important because I use it in my kindergarten classroom. :) I am thrilled with the customer service and the products from this company!!",2020,12
Good product- good price,2020,12
"Works great - no issues with my unit.Power button feels a bit flimsy, saw other reviewers complaining about it breaking and I could see that happening. I am careful with mine and don't use it frequently.Can't change the color away from ""rainbow"" but you can alter the effect slightly. I didn't get this for robust color features so this doesn't bother me.The keys are a bit less diverted and less resistant  then what I'm used to - I frequently hit multiple keys while attempting to push one. Might bother another with sloppy hands like mine but I look at it like a challenge.Now that all being said! This is hands down a great option for wireless gaming. There are slightly cheaper keyboards that tout these specs but they seem to be either too cheaply made or have to many reported issues for me to expect a quality product. On this note, this keyboard is rechargeable! There are other, cheaper brands with similar products but they are mostly battery operated + other issues. In fact, I bought a $20 keyboard, here on amazon, that was similar, no lights, and used batteries - it didn't work upon arrival. This was my second purchase).I got this for gaming wirelessly and use it with additonal 2.4ghz receivers - no issues.  I haven't noticed any input delay but I sit pretty close to the receiver so distance isn't something I have stress tested.Currently this is the keyboard I would recommend for wireless gaming under $60.",2020,12
"First of all the keyboard is FAR from silent! Every time I hit the space bar there is a loud and very audible *clack*! Secondly, just know that you can't change the color scheme, it's just rainbow colored the whole time. You can change the brightness and the speed it *breathes*, but that's it! On the plus side it was ergonomic and comfortable for the 2 minutes I used it before unplugging it and preparing it for return, so there's that I guess. All in all like I said, I'm returning it, this is not what I wanted or expected.",2020,12
Perfect Christmas gift,2020,12
"The keyboard must be either front, left or right of the keyboard, NOT behind you! I like to use my computer while kicking up my legs with my wireless keyboard on my lap, can't do it well all the time because of the range is so poor on this keyboard. I would need to move the entire tower another part of the room to suit my sitting style or buy a usb extender and hopefully move the signal usb stick that comes with the keyboard to in front of me than my tower being behind me.",2020,12
Can’t evaluate the battery life because it’s brand new.,2020,12
I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he seems to love it!,2020,12

Fast shipping and quality as described.,2020,12
Kids absolutely love it and item was exactly as described.,2020,12
This is a perfect replacement for the stock keyboard that came with my new iMac.,2020,12
Seems to be a nice alternative to the more expensive keyboards. Perfect for my young gamer.,2020,12
"It's nothing fancy so don't expect something over the top. Its a basic keyboard with an LED under lay. The keys are not mechanical so you will press a little harder.Customer support was great, my keyboard stopped charging and I reached out for help. They offered a free shipping label and to fix it since I was under warranty. Instead, they sent me a new one, I was happy about that. Good experience overall",2020,12
"First of all the keyboard is very loud ** not silent at all* not even close. Second the discription claims this keyboard is compatible with xbox one **it is not*""False advertising, and loud very .. other than that it looks nice",2020,12
Works very well with my desk top computer don't play games.,2020,12
"I just upgraded from a budget wired keyboard to this, my first wireless keyboard.Pros:-Types quiet, keys are responsive and smooth. Old budget keyboard was hurting my fingers from extended use.-Feels light and minimalist-Had long sittings without needing to recharge (with backlight turned off)-It uses a USB-C charger.Cons:-No dedicated buttons for volume, etc.There are function shortcuts (FN+key) for volume control and calculator. This is nitpicking, but I guess I'd rather have the dedicated buttons for one press, instead of hitting the two combined.-The lighting has a distinct, high-pitched noise that is audible and frustrating.I had to turn it off completely. I didn't buy it for the backlight, but it's still a shame that I can't ever use it.",2020,12
I like the fact I can see the Keys at night. I hate the fact that two out of four receiver stopped working. I still love the two that's working.,2020,12
"I only bought this for the “silent keys.” I have a newborn baby and I needed silent clicks, but this keyboard was more loud than my current gaming keyboard.If you need reviews on anything else please read elsewhere. I didn’t even connect it, simply started typing and was disappointed. 3 stars being generousMaybe the company is comparing their keys to a mechanical stroke keyboard, if that were the case.... then every keyboard would be “silent” compared to those.",2020,12
Not sure why my mice will run a charge for several days on a single triple A battery but this keyboard dies within 1-3 days of being unplugged. I basically leave it plugged in all the time now WhICH DeFEatS thE PUrPose of a wireless keyboard...,2020,12
"The keyboard works good for normal use,  for gaming it is terrible. You cannot press more than a few keys at the same time, if you do some don't respond.  I just broke it in half and threw it in the trash.",2020,12
Just what my son wanted.,2020,08
This is a great keyboard. I have had a couple other keyboards and the reaction seemed to be a little delayed. This keyboard is very responsive and great illumination.,2020,12
So far so good. Great keyboard.,2020,12
I can power keyboard off when not using it so that’s a plus I’ve not had to charge it yet but that’s due to barely using it so definitely worth the money,2020,12
"I needed a wireless keyboard because I started using a standing desk and the less wires the better. I chose this one because it has both bluetooth and USB connection options and I wanted to be able to switch between my office computer and my personal tabtop. The lights are just really nice to look at and they give me a bit of cheer every time I lookdown at the keyboard. It's also really quiet which is nice and it types nicely too. I love that it is easy to take off the key caps and clean the keyboard and there are little ""drain holes"" in each key section to clean out the crumbs....say does anyone know what the word for all the crumbs and dust and stuff that gets stuck in your keyboard is? I learned it on TV once and I can't find it",2020,12
"it needs a charge ever other day, even if it is not used, WHAT JUNKwhen it needs a charge, sometimes it will charge and other times it does not.so now I own this $50.00 KLIM wireless keyboard, that requires the USB cable to be attached to work",2020,12
Wireless rechargeable keyboard,2020,12
" This being my first RGB product, I like it. It's surely not a high end, top of the line, $300 keyboard, but it's enjoyable for what it costs.My only issue - it's a FINGERPRINT MAGNET! And with it being black, it's too easy to see. You can clean it well with non-alcoholic solution though. Be sure to use gentle cloth to avoid smudging.",2020,12
Awesome keyboard. Makes pc gaming a much more better experience,2020,12
Haven't set it up yet. Its a Christmas gift for my 12 year old son. Arrived quickly and looks great. Will review after he uses it.,2020,12
Great product,2020,12
Trash. Bought it to play final fantasy 14 which I’m a working dad so I don’t get to play too much. It’s spends most of its time on the dresser plugged in to ps4. I left it on a few times and now it stopped working all together. Buy at your own risk.,2020,12
I couldn't believe how amazing this was and the price was unbeatable the features are perfect for gaming and got it in record time,2020,12
"The Good:Easy plug and play connection.Keys are lit up real good and easy to see in the dark.Keys have a nice feel to them and are relatively quiet.So far, battery charge lasts the whole day of pretty solid gaming.The Bad:User manual is kinda so so.Backlighting turns off kinda quickly and I'm sure that can be adjusted but again the user manual is kinda so so!",2020,12
" Light weight but feels solid. You feel the keys but no loud clicks. Easy to adjust the brightness and lighting modes. I wish there was a way to adjust the sleep timer, but other than that, I love it. Haven't had it long enough to comment on the battery live, but their USB C is a little short. Not a major issue for me, I have spares up to 10 feet long.Update on the battery life, it's great! Obviously it depends on use, but it lasts as long if not longer than other rechargeable keyboards I have used. The USB C recharges it fast when you need it to.I also have KLIM Blaze wireless mouse and Fusion earbuds. Love I can use the same cable to charge the mouse and keyboard. The earbuds have a much longer cable than most, ideal for moving around while you are plugged in to the computer.",2020,12
"This is almost a decent keyboard.  Unfortunately, some keys are in very unusual positions -- for example single apostrophe should be directly left of Enter key, and backslash should be directly above it.  This may not be important for casuals, but this is anathema for coders.  Didn't use it long enough to test battery life.",2020,12
I like everything about it,2020,12
"I am so angry now.1. The battery life was short, I had to charge a very short time after first use2. It was out of battery again today so I changed it, it worked for about 10 minutes after charged, then stopped responding3. I tried all USB ports of my laptop, all working, so it’s the keyboard4. I tried wireless or wired, doesn’t work, it just doesn’t work!!!",2020,12
Quick and easy set(so easy I didn't realize it was set up😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣),2020,12
"KLIM customer service is amazing. First keyboard I got, wouldn’t connect and became a dud within 2 weeks of use. They sent a brand new one, and it’s been perfect.I still use it, and it’s good for generic typing. However after continuous, everyday use for 40+ hours a week, I’ve begun to choose to only use it on days I may be less busy/typing less quickly.The longer I use it, or the more I have to quickly type it will glitch out. It adds unnecessary keys I know I did not hit, or will duplicate a key stroke. (I.e. Hello looks like Heelloo).All in all, good witless keyboard. Love that it can be charged with a cord, battery life is great, wakes up quickly and has good response time after “sleeping”. It just can’t be expected to put up with long/intermittent time frames of over 60 WPM typing.",2020,12
I LIKE THE LIGHTED KEYBD,2020,12
This was a gift.  I don’t know how it is doing,2020,12
"This was a replacement for another expensive illuminated keyboard which got wet.  I findillumination  and wireless operation to be very handy.  The fact that it is water proof or even water resistant is a bonus.  It is not a completely silent keyboard, but there is very little sound.  Key action is not quite as firm as a mechanical keyboard but not squishy.  Battery life remains to be seen, but it is casually used daily for at least 5 hours with no issues and I only charged it once in a week.  An charge indicator led would be a plus.  So far, it has performed very well and met expectations.",2020,12
This keyboard has a range of about 12 inches and 45 minutes of game time. It is not responsive and most likely the chat will have moved on by the time the keyboard decides to start inputting what you are typing. Had it for less than a week.,2020,12
I bought this to use with Sims on PlayStation 4. Required zero setup right out of the box. Didn’t need to mess with PS4 settings or anything.,2020,12
Lasted 11 months of light use before it would no longer turn on. 2 keys had already started sticking.,2020,12
"After a month the connection became very finicky, constantly cutting in and out. 70% of the time, typing is a nightmare (constant unread inputs), I'd look else where if I were you.",2020,12
"Even with the dongle in clear line of sight, this keyboard constantly locks up in wireless mode. Don't use it for gaming, in fact don't use it for anything.",2020,12
"Quiet but backlit. Backlit lights turn off to save power, but wake up with any key press. Looks nice, and doesn’t clack like a mechanical keyboard.",2020,11
For Gaming,2020,11
It lasted 13 months,2020,11
"My fiance barely used the keyboard, shes a controller player on rocket league and probably had less than 100 keystrokes a day. Keyboard is dead after 1 month and a week",2020,11
used for working,2020,11
Nice quality.,2020,11
"Got it to use my laptop while I have it hooked to the TV, works perfect for my needs.",2020,11
It does what it’s supposed to do.,2020,11
"This keyboard is excellent. I would buy it again. I use it for gaming. I have no complaints in that regard. I have a set up where my PC is in another separate room from my bedroom. It's connected to my TV via 15 foot HDMI/power cables. Even through the wall, it still manages to get good reception with minimal lag (occasionally if I'm positioned really far away in my bedroom (on my bed, rather than in my gaming chair), it will have some brief/noticeable lag, but if I turn it off/turn it on again, it goes back to normal). This issue won't be a problem for most people since they will likely be in the same room as their PC. I don't want to b/c I don't like the noise (however small) that any PC makes.The biggest issue I have with this keyboard is the sound it makes when the RGB is on. It's this high pitched squealing sound. It goes away as soon as the RGB is turned off. This isn't a problem for me since I don't care about RGB one bit and prefer to have it off so it saves battery. But everytime the keyboard turns on, the RGB is automatically on, and hence the sound is immediately there when I turn it on, and I have to turn it off everytime, which is a minor inconvenience. Then again, I'd probably have to do turn it off anyways since I turn off the lighting to save battery. But the sound is noticeable. It's not as loud as a computer fan or anything. But since it's high pitched, you won't not notice it.",2020,11
"Wouldn't take a charge and charge light kept turning off.  Just as bad, the keyboard lighting wouldn't stay on which defeats its whole purpose.  Very disappointed and returning product.",2020,11
I love it 10/10,2020,11
"It arrived with a slight crack- picture of crack in front of keyboard attached.  This keyboard was purchased for my son, to help with school from home.  Since he was excited to use it and it would be helpful, and since there's a pandemic, I didn't want to have to ding around with going someplace to return it, and I didn't want to be without it.  So far it works, and the light up colors make him interested in using it which possibly translates to him doing a better/more timely job with his schoolwork.  Hopefully the crack does not cause it to fail sooner than expected.",2020,11
"I have the KLIM wireless keyboard and like it quite a bit.  My work space is rather limited and I find it handy to pick up the keyboard and move it out of the way while I am multi tasking.  It’s also handy that the keyboard lights up as my eyes get tired and  I often forget to put my glasses on, so the light up keys are helpful.  I do wish the on/off switch was in a handier place however.  However, I am not a gamer, so I don’t know how it might rate in that category.  Otherwise I like the keyboard for all other reasons, weight, size, price and overall usage.",2020,11
Smooth feeling keys. Nice design,2020,11
"So, I got it for my boyfriend who wanted a gaming keyboard but no wire. It was on time in the mail. Looked like it was a returned item with all the tape trying to keep the box together but as it came in the original packaging it makes sense.While it was plugged in we turned it on to see the lights. It was very low with other lights interfering but visible at night or in darkness.We left it to charge as instructed and it never charged. When it was, it lasted 5 minutes at most. The keyboard connected to the laptop as we saw it under the devices but it wouldn't type or send any sort of input in.Overall, wasn't a good buy on my part but for a gift for a gamer boyfriend who hage wires he liked it while it lasted.",2020,11
"the tested latency was 38ms.this keyboard also goes to sleep every 60 seconds, I dont know if you can change this .The deal killer for me was the  space and enter key they were horrible. extremely mushy ive been around keyboards since windows 3.1 i know what im talking about.",2020,11
"Flashing lighted keyboard, wholly separate from laptop.Performs the task needed.big smiles",2020,11
Like the rechargeable battery part the most. Bought this for my gaming grandson and he is happy with it. I will soon be buying one for me to replace my aging keyboard. I liked wireless keyboards but hated replacing batteries.,2020,11
"I play games like World of tank Blitz and FS2 that uses WASD to control a lot. The keyboard really helps me to reduce the load of the original laptop's keyboard. However, this keyboard battery life is not so long that you need to charge probably every 3-4 days if  you play about 2 hours averagely. Plus, it is not so friendly in helping you talking through typing since the arrangement always makes me type out lots of typos.",2020,11
"Awesome product, awesome company! Rechargeable rainbow keyboard? Yes please! This is definitely the most bang for your buck!",2020,08
I purchased this item to play World of Warcraft. I also use a wireless mouse and the keyboard doesn’t work in game if mouse USB is also plugged in. Wrote to Klim and they were not helpful...at all. Will probably return as it doesn’t work for me.,2020,11
"Wished the keyboard was brigther, but all is good.",2020,11
spend 20  more dollars for a better more solid keyboard,2020,11
"Worked great for a week, until the first charge ran out.  Plugged it in and wouldn't charge.  We attempted different cable, different port, different outlet, nothing worked.  Junk.  Returning and buying a different brand.",2020,11
"Its a cheap made useless keyboard. Range is horrible. Sleep mode activates way to soon. Lights turn off only after a second or so, leaving you guessing what key to press if using in the dark. Battery is horrible. Lighting is horrible. Don't bother with this one unless its for a 4 year old.",2020,11
"it is great, the only bad things about it is the point that you can't change the RGB color",2020,11
"I use this for everyday use, mainly for the wireless capabilities since I'm working remotely from lately. This fits my needs perfectly! Definitely recommend.",2020,11
"...So, out of boredom, I ordered one of these gaming keyboards. This one from KLIM and got into the head of the gamer. I must say there is a tangible cool factor to a ""battle-ready"" keyboard. Everything is in the spirit of the gamer. There is an air of science and fantasy as you email your coworkers something really mundane.Aside from that, here's what else the KLIM offers(+) The keyboard is nice and quiet.(+) Accuracy is the same as with my old keyboard.(+) Turning off the lights in my home office and typing from a colorful keyboard is cool.",2020,11
MY SON LOVES THIS AND I THINK EVERY KID THAT GAMES SHOULD HAVE ONE... WORKS GREAT,2020,11
"KLIM is a fantastic company.  I had never heard of them before purchasing this keyboard and I have no ties to them. I had some trouble with the dongle connecting to the keyboard out of the box.  KLIM technology support service was amazing and went above and beyond. The service is friendly and fast. The keyboard itself is awesome. My daughter (12) said the keyboard is so nice she just wants to type things even when her work is done. Great for gaming, looms and feels great. I promote all things KLIM, what a fantastic company.",2020,11
"Works as advertised, does exactly what I wanted.",2020,11
"I like that, it is excellent to use it!",2020,11
Died right after the 90 day return window ended.Edit: customer service sent a replacement,2020,11
This product works as described.,2020,11
"Was great for gaming; however, completely died less than a month after purchase. Had full charge and wouldn’t even turn on when connected to power. Stopped working while using the keyboard mid game. No matter how good the product is, not much use if it doesn’t work.",2020,11
"Says it’s a wireless keyboard and when the internal rechargeable batteries get low to recharge it, however they do not provide any recharging cable. I’m an Apple iPhone user and none of my cables work. I tried going to the website to get any info for charging but there was none to be found",2020,11
works perfect... Just notice the volume font not work from keyboard tho..,2020,11
This worked great for a while. But after some months of regular use it has gotten glitchy. Sometimes it stops communicating with my computer. The battery doesn't last very long anymore. It has become horrible for gaming. I'm currently shopping for a new keyboard.,2020,11
"I love how vibrant the colors are, but they are fixed they don't transition between colors like other keyboard do. But overall it is extremely simple to use and I have had zero issues with this product.",2020,11
"I ordered this on 10/10/2020.  Today is 11/16/2020 and the keyboard is no longer charging.  When I plug the keyboard in, it charges for 30 seconds and then stops.  This is regardless of whether the  keyboard is on or off.",2020,11
I think it kind of disconnects sometimes unless it’s just my laptop.,2020,11
"Im so mad, my keyboard is broken in some letters and numbers and I don't know if you sent me the quality keyboard, I am very disappointed with your keyboard, I used 20 days it is very good and after  that it was damaged, hope you read this comment then refund me",2020,11
Playing games I get extreme key lag... Would not recommend it. HORRIBLE KEYBOARD!!!!!!!! TECH support is bad too,2020,11
"Battery finally died for the first time after about 3 weeks. Sets the bar pretty high.Resistance is perfect and not loudKeys are bright enough to be cool and visible but not blinding in the dark.Charges relatively fast and you can use it while charging.First delivery didn't show up, but Amazon worked it out with me.",2020,11
Works great for in game chatting on my PS4! Love it!! 😀,2020,11
"I use this to game with, I am by no means an extreme or hard core gamer. It works just fine for me to sit on my couch and play The Witcher 3. The light feature is nice, if you want one you can customize look elseware. This is a budget keyboard and works well for what it is.",2020,11
I'm not the greatest at typing numbers.  I thought this would be a good night time solution to see the number buttons but the light is too dim as well as the numbers printed too small on the keyboard.  I found the battery life lacking as well.,2020,11
Was really cool until it stopped working so had to return.,2020,11
Pretty solid keyboard. Quiet and nice feel to it. Seems to be constructed well.,2020,08
"I've enjoyed using this keyboard but one big problem I seem to be running into is the battery life. I have 2 other wireless keyboards that will last a week before I have to recharge them. Using this one for about the same about of time, I have been having to recharge it multiple times a week. Not sure if the backlight is draining the battery that much but that seems like a major difference. Some of the keys sometimes stick or don't seem to respond unless you press them very hard.",2020,10
I have used better controlled lights on other keyboards both wired and wireless. This one works though and feels great to the touch.,2020,10
"You do have to press a key to activate lighting unlike some other keyboards you only have to touch.  Not a big problem, I just press the CTRL key to fire it up.",2020,10
"Despite there only being 2 feet between my computer/the USB adapter and this keyboard, the unit disconnects constantly. It’s okay for RTS games but is literally unplayable with anything that requires constant use of the keyboard. Do not buy this keyboard!",2020,10
"If you want a keyboard with backlighting, then this is not the keyboard for you. It does not stay backlit for more than a minute, when not being used, which is more than annoying. And, the instructions as to programming it to stay on does not change anything, in that regard. I sent it back and will be returning to tried and true LOGITECH.",2020,10
"I had a small technical issue with my keyboard, and KLIM went above and beyond - more than any other business that I have worked with. Amazing company. Keyboard is good stuff too :).",2020,10
I plugged in the wireless. Typing i got duplicate strokes or no strokes at all. I basically had to treat it like it was severely lagging and typed very slow.Returning it tomorrow.,2020,10
Love my new Keyboard!!!,2020,10
Sometimes the keyboard lag. I don't type fast either. I type slower then the average keyboard user. But I do like it. Easier to see what I'm typing in the dark.,2020,10
Batteries really have a long life before needing a recharge.,2020,10
Stopped working after 2 months.,2020,10
I hate sleep mode im just gonna put that out there. otherwise the keyboard is alright. cheap plastic and one of the pieces broke off when I was checking the space bar... but I managed.,2020,10
"They keyboard works fine, able to maintain connection and battery life is fine. The  spring or what ever is supporting the space bar can be improved. Feels very weak and need to make sure space bar is pressed in a certain area for it to register a command. This is fine for web browsing or working on word documents, however this can be burdensome when playing games",2020,10
"My son enjoyed it, used it for gaming",2020,10
Suddenly died out of nowhere. Purchased in March when I started my first pc build. Currently have no response from keyboard in wireless or wired mode.  Tried using it on 4 several machines to make sure it was not just me.  Works fine in the beginning but long term is a no go.,2020,10
Love this keyboard so far. I hope I'm not disappointed,2020,10
Perfect but I would like to see how much battery life I have left,2020,10
Nice and quiet. Not as sensitive as I like but it works,2020,10
Good response,2020,10
"Where has this been all my life?!  Talk about making my typing on the TV from my PS4 way more accurate and fast. What a great keyboard, easy to charge, charges quickly and the colors are lovely and bright.",2020,10
Good keyboard. Has a nice touch and brightness.,2020,10
Like the smooth keys and light color combinations,2020,10
The keyboard is great! I work from home in my son's bedroom so in the mornings and during nap time I work in complete darkness. The keyboards brightness is perfect as I don't have to adjust the monitor's brightness too high.The fact that it is rechargeable with a type C makes it ideal as I can charge my phone as well. So far I've gone 3 days without having to charge the keyboard. I am a Excel shortcut junkie and have had no issues.I'm looking forward to continue using the keyboard.,2020,10
"Recently bought the keyboard less then three days ago. Despite being fully charged it constantly turns off and stutters when I try to use it for WoW. ( I’ll press the w key to move forward and my character will take a step, stop for a few seconds and take a step while i hold the key down) do not waste your money on this.",2020,10
I bought this for my Son to use on his XBox1 and he also uses it on his school laptop. He says that he doesn't have any issues with it and likes how quiet the keys are.,2020,10
"Beautiful keyboard, automatically recognised by windows 10. The charge port is Type C, this charging wire is accompanied with the package.Update: It can't be charged, and I check the ammeter only 0.01 A current  flow in to the keyboard. I need to connect the charging cable when I use the keyboard.",2020,10
"I expected more considering its the most expensive keyboard I've ever bought. Customer support is useless. The lights were cool when it worked consistently. Another piece of Chinese made garbage from Amazon, at least I've learned my lesson recently on buying stuff like this. Lost the value of a year worth of prime from poorly made products like this oof. It's learning experience I guess. Buy a logitech or something reputable.",2020,10
Keys light up very brite.,2020,10
Worst keyboard i've ever owned BY FAR. I am typing and right in the middle of every thing it freezes and takes 5 minutes to catch up. Did not work at all for games. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH.,2020,08
"This is my third try at a wireless backlit keyboard. The first two were from different manufacturers. The first two consistently duplicated and omitted many keystrokes. FINALLY found one that does what I expected it to do. The adjustable brightness backlight works fine and all keystrokes are accurate. The key profiles are not as tall as other products in this category which is good for me. I wouldn't think that should matter, but I found the taller keys on some of the others to be annoying.  I like the somewhat minimal footprint for a full feature keyboard as space on my desk is limited. I don't use this for gaming, but sometimes I have to get up in the middle of the night for a work call and the adjustable brightness backlit keyboard is a welcome feature so I don't have to turn on the room lights for two minutes of computer work at 5AM. Overall, I am very pleased.",2020,10
Easy to see in the dark.Great feel to keys.Good battery life.Would buy again,2020,10
Wireless connectivity is pretty bad.  My keyboard is on a desk 2 ft. away from my tower which is on the ground.  If I shift the keyboard too far it will result in a loss of keystroke recognition.  Connectivity will be intermittent.  Will most likely return this one.,2020,10
I absolutely loved this key board. But after 5 months it doesn’t work. I thought the battery died but I plugged it in and it still won’t turn back on.,2020,10
This keyboard was great while it was working but six months later it doesn’t work at all.,2020,10
The lighting is very nice and the key are soft kind if u know wut i mean,2020,10
The BEST,2020,10
Just got this. So far it is amazon. I love the colors. The only thing that is slightly disappointing is how quickly the lights go off when you are not typing. I wish there was an option to leave the lights on longer.,2020,10
"Nothing special about this keyboard. I’m not fond of the manufacturers website.Adding to this review. After less than a year of use the battery is failing. One of the issues is the forced keyboard lighting. There is no way to turn it off.  While the keyboard saw heavy use, the main function, wireless, is hampered by poor design. I am reducing my review to reflect this issue after testing. I do not recommend this product.",2020,10
Wasn’t able to use it because I am missing the dongle. I contacted Klim and am awaiting a replacement dongle in the mail.Edit: issue pleasantly handled.,2020,10
To loud...definitely not quiet.,2020,09
"The keyboard linked up to my laptop immediately and I turned on the backlit color which was cool; however, the buttons and the keys themselves are very flimsy.Doesn't feel like a quality keyboard but it does look nice.",2020,09
It’s for gaming with cool lighting. My son loves it.,2020,09
Battery life is no good. followed manufacturer procedure for the initial charge. Frequent disconnect from USB adapter. Lighting is about the only good thing. constantly missing keystrokes while typing. as it is right now as I write this. Claims to be quite typing nope don't get that either. I'm hard of hearing and its annoying. I would look somewhere else.  Should've returned it,2020,09
I like it cause it is quiet.,2020,09
Very good,2020,09
“New” keyboard came with seal broken and dongle missing rendering this keyboard all but useless. Looks like it might have been a decent product but not really confident in this distributor.,2020,09
The keyboard is great and much more quiet than others gaming keyboards. Issue with power port which is flimsy and does not stay connected adequately,2020,09
"I like the feel of the keys, colors and brightness",2020,09
"I bought this Keyboard to replace my old one because my daughter spilt her drink on it. This keyboard has worked out perfectly. It keeps a long charge and is easy to move around. I have my home office set up at the kitchen table. My daughter also uses it for school. I love that it is not too bright, but lights up just enough to see the keys when needed. I would recommend this to anyone with kids and those who needs to move around their work area frequently.",2020,09
The ENTER button is a huge issue. I love the keyboard except for the place and shape of the enter key. My finger hits that |\ button and the enter button all the time. The keyboard is perfect in everything else. I just can't get passed that part. I returned the keyboard and ordered KLIM Light V2 Rechargeable Wireless Keyboard US Layout for 29.95. That one has fix the ENTER button issue.,2020,09
Worked great the first week. Stopped holding a charge and working after the second week. Sent back after a month of having because it wasn't worth the effort of charging to full only for it to work for 2 hours if at all. Can't even have it plugged in and charging while using so that wasn't even a possible work around. Bought a different brand and have been using for a few months without any issues. Don't waste your time with this wireless keyboard.,2020,09
don't  waist your money . my first one stopped working in a month. the replacement  died in 2 weeks .,2020,09
Its very dropable but I like it,2020,09
Perfect for wireless gaming for my son,2020,09
"This keyboard looked great in the Amazon pix and had great reviews. Unfortunately, I never got around to actually trying it out until 4 days after the return window closed. I hate this thing, and will never use it, for several reasons:1) The actual keys don't light up, just the areas underneath them, and it's VERY dim.2) It's not bright at all, and I can't distinguish any changes when I use the brightness keys.3) The ""static breathing"" doesn't change at all when I press the keys.",2020,08
Absolutely in love. Exceeded expectations. Highly reccomend!!,2020,08
"This keyboard looks and feels really nice. It's nice and quiet and I like the rainbow color display. I don't game much so I can't really opine on its quality there but I imagine the feel and reach of it is nice for those that do, although that big Enter button might throw you off a little bit if you're not used to the layout - I kept hitting the Insert key instead of the backspace from time to time.I have a 3-screen display, two are daisy-chained monitors using DisplayPort and one is a TV using HDMI. I noticed that in its regular position on my desk, it seemed to type fine on screen 1, have a somewhat delayed buggy input on screen 2, and perhaps due to the distance between the dongle and the TV, no response on there.I moved the dongle to the keyboard to the top of my tower instead of the back side, but it still didn't accept any input from my keyboard when I wasn't even 6 feet away from my computer - to me, that on top of not seeming to properly respond to my other screens is a large drawback for a wireless keyboard, especially when I paid $60 for it. I had a cheaper Logitech that worked just fine for about 15 feet, and I only got this one because it died three years later to the day and that model seems to be discontinued.I want to like this because it works great when it wants to, but the problems I've had just in the first week aren't worth what I paid for it. I almost never return anything but I think I'm gonna have to with this.",2020,09
Works well keys light up very nicely,2020,09
I love this keyboard and it works & looks great but a warning to anyone else with small hands - it's a little hard to use. I find myself having to stretch quite a bit and I hit the wrong keys much more frequently than with other keyboards.,2020,09
"It is a pretty keyboard, but the battery life is extremely disappointing. I've had to plug it in to recharge about 5 times now and it only just arrived 10 days ago. :(",2020,09
"Constantly lags or just stops working while trying to type, even when the battery is full.",2020,09
"The keys themselves are fairly quiet, but the space bar appears to only be anchored in one spot, so it clicks when you press it.  Calling this keyboard silent is false advertising.  Also, I have had the problem with using the left ctrl+shift keys in a keystroke sequence, like when clearing cache or opening an incognito window, which I regularly need to do for work, the right ctrl+shift keystroke works though.I do like the battery life and the backlight, but I will be returning this and looking for something different.",2020,09
"This is a great keyboard.  The keys are quiet and don't travel far when pressed down.  It lights up well enough to be seen clearly in the dark, and despite being make out of plastic instead of aluminum it seems fairly sturdy.  That said, this is not the keyboard for me.I'm an old-school computer programmer, and I am on my keyboard all day long.  I prefer a loud, clicky keyboard reminiscent of the old IBM PC keyboard.  This keyboard is nothing like that.  It's extremely quiet, and the keys don't travel far when pressed.  I was looking for a borderline typewriter feel.  This keyboard is more for gaming and such.Again, this is a great keyboard and clearly matches its marketing.  It was just not the keyboard I was looking for.",2020,09
Purchased it for my son who is a gamer.  He picked it out after doing the research on Amazon. He really enjoys the every aspect of the keyboard.  It is lightweight therefore he has taken it with him abroad.,2020,09
"After 2 months stopped working. None of the key functions work & the keyboard is fully charged. Should have read the negative reviews. Like others have said stopped working right after the return window closed. Also, for what this cost the lighting on it should stay on constant but it doesn't. You have to hit a key for it to come on. They charge way too much for this piece of garbage. Amazon needs to give more than a 1 month window for returns. Guess I'll stick to Best Buy for electronics. If I could have gave it less than one star I would have.",2020,09
I wanted to do 5 stars on this but I do have a slight issue with the design of the keyboard itself. It may be the best keyboard you have owned really; I've just broken so darn many it's unfunny. (Not this model - yet) My main gripe is the whole function key is right side only - which wouldn't be horrible (for me) if I wasn't consistently used to 1 handed volume and media controll. I may have just bought the wrong keyboard - there are other options; this is the one I bought and it was 60 bucks and I'm not pleased with it due to this. Again - may work wonders for you - a non media junkie.,2020,09
After a few months several of the keys stopped working. Would not recommend!,2020,09
"Very nice response, no lag or delay at all. Fantastic keyboard.",2020,09
"Arrived very well packaged, with a special note included that made me laugh! Worked immediately out of the box and have not had a single issue with it so far, had it about a week.",2020,09
"It's a good keyboard, with caveats in order of personal importance:1) The key layout is different from the typical U.S. keyboards I've used in the past 10 - 15 years2) The backlighting is dim at its brightest and goes out quickly. (Maybe there's a way to make it persist till some timeout period.)3) The keys are a tad squishy, but otherwise they feel okay",2020,09
My 16 year old daughter loves this addition to her gaming desktop!!,2020,09
"The keyboard is great in general, but the USB Receiver broke off in my USB port, after 3 months...  They really should either include more than one receiver, or make them more robust, and of higher quality. :/",2020,09
Cool looking and feels great.,2020,09
"The keyboard is very light and doesn’t feel too cheap...but it never detected on my dell computer. I’m not sure if it ‘s my software (Windows) or the keyboard, but it would light up and then go dark when I tried typing on it. The manual didn’t explain anything because the keyboard is supposed to automatically be detected and work. My other Vic mouse and redragon keyboard work just fine. Returning for a refund, will stick with my wired for now.",2020,09
This keyboard stopped working. Terrible keyboard doesnt do all the function it shows to it description. Avoid this product. Way overpriced and KLIM support is also terrible too.,2020,09
"Ill start with cons.*unresponsive sometimes.*doesnt tell if the battery is low, there is no indicator so if youre playing intensely and stops all of a sudden it will pissed u off a little.*keyboard sound is like so and so its not mechanical,it will make a sound depends how heavy you type.*You can't customize the RGB, its fixed.Pros*keyboard lights wont bother you if you play while the lights are off.*keyboard lights has 3 modes which is cool. Steady, Pulse and no lights. You can also adjust the light from low to high.*rechargable and has its own usb C type cable and has its own bluetooth connector to pc.*when charged it lasts quite long if you play casually it can go up to 3 to 4 days without charging.*it goes on sleep mode if not in use.*lightweight, I always put this on my lap since my pc is connected to my tv and I always play from my bed.*budget friendly, its a good keyboard. If youre not ready for razer's and corsair type of peripherals and looking for a budget friendly one then give this keyboard a try.***UPDATE***I'am returning the keyboard as it is faulty. The @ and "" (quotation mark) got switched. Its becoming more and more unresponsive. I got this 13 days ago and its not doing so well.Update on battery, it lasts 2 days max if used casually.I'am changing my review to 2 star and I dont recommend this now. Better look for something else or really invest to a good brand gaming keyboard instead. Its a waste of time and money for just little feature.",2020,09
I don’t Game so I did not find it fair to give it reviews on that factor but this keyboard is great! Now that I am working from home and my days never seem to end this keyboard was just what I needed especially for working at night.,2020,09
"Just like the head states, the windows key no longer functions. Also, I don't particularly appreciate that the lights on the keyboard do not stay illuminated for more than a few seconds. I work on three monitors, and I need a functioning windows key to move, you guessed it, my windows around using the shortcut windows + shift + arrow key. I figured it was my PC, so I changed to a different PC in the house. I had the same issue. Then I went back to my wired keyboard, no problems—another keyboard for the junk pile.",2020,09
In my opinion this keyboard is not a product worth the money. Various key functions did not work.,2020,09
"I have a dark living room & can't see the keyboard, this one glows in neon colors, makes it easy to see what you are typing.  Being cordless allows me to sit on the couch & play games, type e-mails, etc. without restrictions.  Best one i have had yet!",2020,09
"This is a good looking keyboard. The rainbow colors you see are all you can get, so no selection of one color is available, although the brightness settings are adjustable which is nice. Not a critical issue, as I said, it's a nice looking keyboard. But functionally, there are a couple of issues that are immediately apparent.First, the enter key. As in the picture attached, has a notch in it that is shared with the \ key. I am CONSTANTLY hitting the \ and enter resulting in failed passwords and clutters chat messages. So at a minimum, it will take some time to get used to this and hit the enter key alone.Another issue seems to be battery life. Instructions indicate 4 hours to charge. I can accept that. What I can't accept is the life of the battery after. In the short time I have had this keyboard, it has died on my twice within a day of getting a full charge. So sleep function is either broken or poorly designed with regard to maintaining battery life. So now I am keeping it wired with the provided cable because I cannot be without a keyboard when it dies, and plugging it into a power source is not enough. Once the battery is dead, it will not power up until it has gotten enough of a charge to respond.  But connected to the PC via USB cable makes it online instantly. Overall a poor technical design.My only other complaint, and it could just be me adapting from laptop keyboards to a mechanical desktop keyboard again, but typing on this keyboard continues to feel clumsy. But while writing this review, I took a moment to look closer. The keys on this keyboard are probably a good 20% smaller surface area than either laptop I typically use. This adds to the closeness of the keys and why I am constantly off a key here and there typing as I normally do by feel alone. A square key up from the base versus the pyramidal shape of these keys would make them bigger and more tolerable. This is what may ultimately force me to try another keyboard and send this one back.",2020,09
"The keyboard looks and feels nice to use. HOWEVER I have barely uses this keyboard and I am encountering connection issues. I open up a web browser go to start typing and nothing happens. I turn it off and on again. Wait a few seconds, then again start typing. It doesnt type. Then again a few seconds and it registered 3 letters. Other times it functions properly. Too unrealiable.",2020,09
I bought this for working at home.  I like my room dark and needed a lighted KB. Problem is KB light shuts off after 60 seconds of inactivity. No option to stay on or stay on longer.,2020,09
"the keyboard itself was lit up it was charged. I tried multiple USB ports and rebooted my computer. also tried on another computer. Did not want to seem to connect wirelessly, also in an attempt to get it to work thought that possibly wiring it to my computer using the charging USB port it might work just not wirelessly. which I did not. Then went through amazon tech and am now returning the product. I think Ill be looking for another brand because Im still in need of a wireless backlit keyboard",2020,09
"It works fine.  The lights are a little dim, but that's not a big deal for me.  I really wanted it because it looked cool, it's wireless and my old key board was pretty noisy.  This one looks cool, but it's just as noisy.  I'm an English teacher and I use the computer during study hall.  It still makes a lot of noise in a quiet room.",2020,09
Love this keyboard. Its exactly what I wanted.,2020,09
Great gaming keyboard. Not as bright as I thought it would be.,2020,09
Beautiful Keyboard,2020,09
"My only real complaint is that every time you actually turn the switch off, when you switch it back on it goes back to full lights. That's a personal preference I know, but I only turn the lights on occasionally.You should also know that the positioning of the colors is not changeable. They are on, pulsing on/off, or off. No ability to change any of the lights, which is fine by me, but might bother other people.",2020,09
"Needed a keyboard that was backlit but did not want just plain white. I use this for my desktop computer since I am now working from home so I can’t speak for gamers but for my job it’s been great! The colors really pop and you can adjust the brightness, or just turn off the color all together. Very happy with my purchase!",2020,09
"Nice wireless keyboard - I bought to replace a Logitech wireless KB that got banged around for the last couple of years. The only minor gripe is I wish  there was a bit more margin around the edge - I often hit a key accidentally when picking it up. It is light weight wise, and the lighted keypad is great for dark rooms.",2020,09
This keyboard is great! The keys are a little louder than I’d like but I got used to it within a few hours.,2020,08
Love this thing. Easy to use. Really light. Good feel to the keys nice and quiet. A wonderfully helpful small company that makes affordable and well made equipment,2020,08
"Listen, it does the job of a keyboard, but the multicolored lights are fixed, you cannot make them go white, so at times, it's actually impossible to see the characters on the keys if you're dealing with the glare of a monitor.",2020,08
All the buttons are smooth but the space bar for some reason is loud and gets very annoying when you are typing. Sounds like it is loose.,2020,08
"I had this for one day and the connection issues were terrible. Towards the end it wouldn't even type anymore. I charged it and nothing. This utterly, truly sucked. Save yourself 40 dollars and your patience.",2020,08
"Liked the keyboard, but as I have large hands, was not a good fit for me...",2020,08
"This keyboard goes in and out will work then stops now its has stop working .. don't buy call warranty co and was told to make a claim they provide the wrong site so the claim that was submitted was for ""their"" clothing.... rep didn't refer me to another site ... amazon wasn't useful either ...",2020,08
"Seems like this is a solid keyboard so far. The build quality is lighter than I would like it to be, but solid enough.",2020,08
"Nice keyboard overall, the tactile feedback is pleasant (although I don't like the placement of the '\' key). The colorful backlight is cool.BUT: Some keyboard shortcuts simply do not work. CTRL+SHIFT+N for example doesn't work if you use the left CTRL/SHIFT keys. That's pretty outrageous since that is a very common shortcut used in many apps on most operating systems. It's not just my keyboard, this is apparently a known issue with the keyboard: https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx2FHIE8OMWYLYM/ref=ask_dp_dpmw_al_hzaI don't know how KLIM can sell a keyboard with a known defect, and without warning about it.",2020,08
Stopped working after 3 months of light use.  Also did not hold a charge for long before having to be wired to a USB port for charging.  The Rechargeable batteries cannot be replaced.  I would not buy again from this manufacture.,2020,08
"I had an issue with the original USB cord not working. I contacted customer support, and they provided extremely generous resolutions. The battery lasted me a month without changing. I would absolutely buy from the company again",2020,08
The product sold to me was used and listed as new.,2020,08
I’m glad I found this light up wireless keyboard for my home office. I had to get used to typing on it but it works and looks great.,2020,08
it was awesome until it died.  no abuse or anything bad on our end.  totally stopped working after 7 months. bummer,2020,08
USB dongle fell apart. Shorted my computer. Then would not work or would notLet my computer go into sleep mode. Had this less than a year. Normal use.,2020,08
works very well. Doesnt click super loud which I like. You can hear it but its not loud.  Holds a good charge!,2020,08
nice,2020,08
Unable to recharge due to a damaged port!,2020,08
 Goes perfect with my set up 👍🏾,2020,08
">> UPDATE AFTER 1YR 2M OF USAGE: I used the keyboard almost everyday for a whole year - mostly for work rather than gaming and it is still like new! Then one day I had to switch out my laptop at work and forgot to take the USB receiver before turning it in. Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve it and was beating myself up for it! Going back to using the laptop keys was  highly excruciating so I decided to take a chance and ask if the USB receiver was replaceable.Their customer service is PHENOMENAL. The same rep communicated with me throughout the process (have you ever played hot potato with customer service?? Then you know how amazing this feels) and she always responded pretty quickly to my emails - there was never a lag time! The only hiccup I ran into was at the very beginning when I searched for a customer service portal through Amazon. The initial link connected me with the KLIM technical riding gear rather than KLIM Technologies. However, they gave me the correct email address immediately and it was smooth sailing from there.They told me the USB receiver is replaceable (YAYYYY) but that a part was on backorder. I was more happy to know I'd be able to continue using the keyboard so I was willing to wait! A month later they provided an update that the part was still on backorder but that they were going to send me a new one!!! It arrived as promised and I can go back to typing comfortably and with lightening speed!!!<<<<I just got it and have only used it for a couple of hours but I'm thoroughly impressed by this keyboard! Smooth buttons, smooth typing, comfortable feel, and full sized buttons. And I now have a number key pad!The presentation was also impressive - a black little envelope with a seemingly personalized note - with a little flare - from the makers when you open the box. Love it.Just the quality of the keys make it obvious that it will be great for game play. The keys feel so light and smooth under my fingers as I type! I hope it lasts forever!",2020,08
Iove the sleep mode that turns off the keyboard while it's not being used. I would still recommend turning it off when not in use .,2020,08
"Loved this keyboard but after 6 months certain keys (w, s, l) just stopped working. Wish I could return!",2020,08
"Good looking keyboard, my son love the color, and its dual you can used with cord or without cord.",2020,08
It got keys,2020,08
"First and foremost, I have had this keyboard almost a year now. The first keyboard I received was DOA which anyone who knows much about electronics knows that that is just how it is sometimes.  I contacted their customer support and within a week had a new keyboard. Initially this was amazing and I saw no issues but as time went on, it stopped charging properly I believe. I am on my computer long hours every day as I work from home and then game at night. If I charge it at night with the keyboard set to ""off"" it lasts the whole day normally. Even then sometimes it doesn't but overall it does. Other times even while it is plugged in, it shuts off randomly making gaming hard. If Klim were reading this I would suggest two things, add some way to show a battery charge on the keyboard, and upgrade the battery stability. This keyboard after a year is acting like the one that was faulty did. Just a year later. For those who are reading this, I would suggest this keyboard unless you use it 12/14 hours a day. It simply isn't built for that it feels like.",2020,08
It has a good response rate for a wireless keyboard. Any delay is unnoticeable to most people.,2020,08
I guess I did not realize that this was only rechargeable and did not take batteries...but my daughter loves it!,2020,08
"Exactly what my son was wanting, and at a great price and as usual, very fast delivery",2020,08
Good I recomend this keyboard.,2020,08
"Very sleek keyboard. It is wireless however it lasts for quite some time before you have to recharge it. It performs very well, lightweight, with soft keys. The lights are absolutely beautiful",2020,08
Stays on 24/7. Battery dies in less than 2 days unlike advertised. So I have to keep it plugged in. I don’t know what these guys are doing. But this isnt it. I hate this thing sorry to say. I had high hopes for it,2020,06
My 13 year old son loves it. Lights match his led desk / mouse pad lights and his Lenovo Legion gaming mouse (along with his Legion laptop). It works well for virtual school this year and online gaming. Overall - great purchase.,2020,08
Features are easy to use and keys are easy to see,2020,08
"Nice keyboard, does not come charged. Just plugin and works fine. Quick sleep mode and once you touch the keyboard the lights come on. I don't like that and I hope I change it, just haven't been able to yet. Overall it's smooth to type and is not loud at all.",2020,08
"Pro-Excellent backlighting, Lock keys indicators that are not usually seen on other wireless keyboards including Logitech and Microsoft, the keyboard has a great crisp positive feel, there is no battery to replace, It is perfectly sized for under-desk trays.Con-not sure if there is a battery low indicator as the battery did run down.  Too expensive.",2020,08
Very nice. I love the different color light within the keyboard that light up when you are typing.,2020,08
"I love it overall! Since my laptop keyboard are a bit sticky for some reason so using this keyboard actually is a bit bigger. I keep missing the enter button all the time but overall, I love it!",2020,08
"**UPDATED**After five months of use, the keyboard suddenly died for no reason. I tried all troubleshooting I could and it just doesn’t turn on. I turns on for about half a second and turns back off. I guess you get what you pay for. Doesn’t last long whatsoever.*ORIGINAL Review*I had been looking for a wireless gaming keyboard that wasn't loud and had backlighting. It's not the perfect keyboard and I didn't expect it to with that price. The two things I would change in their second version would be to make the RGB a bit more versatile or customizable (to save a little on battery) and make the keys feel a little more ""clicky"" because hard to feel if the key went through sometimes. Overall, I love the weight, its durability, and slick look. I knocked it for two things but they are picky at this point.",2020,08
This keyboard was awesome for the price.  Keys feel really natural and it is a quality product.  The batteries don't last super long but I keep it plugged in.Would recommend if you are looking for an affordable gaming keyboard!,2020,08
Good entry-level keyboard.  It does the job.  I wish light stay on and doesn’t turn off when not touching it for long time.  Great add-on to my other KLIM items.,2020,08
"This is a nice little keyboard. I was purchasing for typing, not gaming. The keys are quiet. Seemed to be responsive, but I just didn't care for how short it was. While using my wrist rest I had to angle my hands downward to reach the keys. If you don't use a wrist rest, than I would recommend this keyboard.",2020,08
"Bought this awhile ago to start setting up my home office, didn’t need it right away so I set the box aside. Pulled it out this weekend to discover that the keys don’t work correctly. Multiple keys are “stuck” together. Typing “T” or “G” displays tg for example. Keyboard is essentially useless, but because I didn’t examine it right away my return window has expired and I’m stuck with junk that doesn’t work. Lesson learned.",2020,08
"It's a solid keyboard. It's feels very light, and less substantial that my previous, a MS wireless comfort keyboard which is still going strong after 10+ years. It also feels very soft to the touch, both the material itself and the key presses. I think part of this is in the waterproof design.What I really bought this for is:1) Smaller footprint than my previous keyboard. It's a full size keyboard that requires substantially less desktop space. It makes a difference for my use.2) Backlighting for when I'm typing at night and I don't want the harshness of an overhead light or even lamp sometimes. The backlighting on this is great if you're fine with the multi-color. There is an option to turn it off during the day and there is also a dimmer which works great.What doesn't work:1) It's weird but when editing text I often use ctrl+shift and the arrow keys to highlight large chunks of text at a time. So far this works on this keyboard, but only if I'm using ctrl+shift keys on the left side together or the right side together. It doesn't fully work when I use ""right ctrl + left shift + right arrow"" keys. Weird.2) I would have much preferred a standard sized carriage return (Enter key for you youngins). Now to press enter, my pinky has to travel much farther and it takes noticeable effort. The old school ""reverse L"" shaped Enter key is king. I hope maybe on the 2021 version they will correct this. If they did, it would be worth buying again for that change alone.I'm still getting adjusted to the slightly new layout and key response. My typing isn't as fast yet. I find with this soft key press business, I have to press a little more aggressively to get the space bar for instance to register. It's slight, but noticeable. Whether you think that's a good thing or not is up to you. Definitely needs a palm rest. Sensitive hands/wrists may still prefer the design of a curved keyboard. I swear by curved/split keyboards. They make a difference. I don't use it for gaming, so no comment there. I'm imagine it's responsive enough.",2020,08
"Solid key board. No warning before it dies, but lasts a long time between charges. I like it.",2020,08
Super quiet keys and great feeling. Makes my setup up look extra clean without all the wires,2020,08
"Excelent Product! thanks, and very funny with the instructions! thanks a lot",2020,08
"At first, this keyboard was everything I wanted in a wireless keyboard. I have always been skeptical of wireless keyboards. It worked wonders at first but as I started to work with it there would be very random connection issues where it would not register my typing.This seller was kind enough to send me a second keyboard even and the same issue was happening. I really do think it was an issue with my very many wireless electronics nearby, but never found out what the issue was.However, I gave this a 4 star rating because of how well it worked when it did and for the customer service. I don't leave very many reviews, but this seller really does deserve credit for a great customer service experience as well as making a great product, however unfortunate it did not work for me. They were even kind enough to send me a gift for the inconvenience AND gave me a coupon voucher for their other products.Excellent service!",2020,08
I like the back lit keys but the keyboard has really short battery life.  We have to charge it a few times/week and we do not use it all day.,2020,08
I had a wireless keyboard before I purchased this one. It lagged while I typed and sometimes would have to sit for half a minute before I could start again. I love this keyboard. It's does everything I need it to do. Love fact I can charge it and never needs batteries to be replaced.,2020,06
"The product arrived in an undamaged box, with the details of the keyboard on the back. Upon opening the box there was the keyboard, a small envelope, and a user manual in several languages. The keyboard had the wireless connector in the back, and a power switch to turn it on.  Inside the envelope was a note on how the shipping was processed, along with branded stickers. The keys on the keyboard all work very well and do make a nice clicking noise. Overall I am very happy with this product and would be happy to get other products from the same brand.",2020,08
"I'll first mention that if you are buying this, you probably don't want to spend an arm and a leg for a gaming keyboard, however, you definitely get the most for what you pay for.I've been using this keyboard for months now, and though it isn't as comfortable or bright as others it gets the job done. I don't really care too much about the light features (fading mode, breathing mode) but my biggest problem is the brightness of the light. If the room is well lit you can definitely tell RGB is lit, but its a bit dimmer than I expected. At night I was hoping to clearly see the major change in color between the keys on the keyboard but the keys do not allow a lot of light through the transparent plastic on each key. You can see the color very clearly BETWEEN the keys but not so much for THROUGH each key. The only improvement I suggest would be to make the keyboard slightly less harsh on the hands after hours of typing and increasing the maximum brightness of the keyboard. Besides that, the battery is fine for the price and you can still use the keyboard if the battery dies by plugging it in, which is pretty convenient.Like I said you get what you pay for and this is more than fine. Klim did pretty well and this keyboard has lasted me several months without any major issues.",2020,08
"this is the best rgb keyboard value you can find out there. The size is jsut perfect, not too big or too slow.",2020,08
Very responsive keyboard and love the multi color lights. Also like that it’s pretty silent when you press the keys compared to other keyboards,2020,08
"I like very much this RGB Wireless Keyboard, the batteries last FOREVER beautiful color and brightness,  very silent....i just love it",2020,07
"Product loos great and it feels awesome, however I am experiencing a HUGE issue when it comes to the keyboard not responding to me typing. I'd have to turn the keyboard off or plug in a usb cable to it and sometimes it still acts as if I didn't enter a key. This is very frustrating. I've checked to see if it was device drivers, anything that's not updated on  my system, manufacturer's website, etc. Still experiencing this issue. Does anyone know how to resolve this. If so this product would definitely receive a 5tar rating!",2020,07
Great wireless keyboard for my Xbox one.,2020,07
"Many functions in many programs use CTRL+SHIFT.  CTRL+SHIFT does not work in any way on this keyboard. This is unexpected and totally unacceptable behavior in a keyboard. These key combinations are intrinsic to many functions in Windows. It is time to return for a refund. Darn. I liked the size and feel, but functionality is compromised and I need a working keyboard - not a crippled one.",2020,07
"We finally find a good replacement for our old wireless keyboard. This one is good. I had tried using it to play Dark Souls 3. Even the keyboard is about 3 meters away from my PC, it's still very responsive while playing this game. Very satisfied.No return this time and certainly 5 stars for this item.",2020,07
I really like this keyboard.  The keys are soft and the back light colors are not too bright.,2020,07
"--Update--Still liking the keyboard after ~5 months of daily use. My only two issues are:1. The ""\"" button location is terrible. I am mostly used to it at this point, but still accidentally press ""\"" instead of ""Enter"" all the time.2. Although the battery life is good, there is no indicator for ""low battery"". This means the keyboard will just unexpectedly stop in the middle of typing when it's dead.----I have been using this keyboard daily for the past three weeks. I use it about 8 hrs a day during the work week and have had to charge it twice since getting it. Pretty good!It is by no means a ""silent"" keyboard, but it is much quieter than my previous keyboard and is not disruptive to my office mate/husband. I am a reasonably fast typer (~90 wpm) and the keyboard is responsive. Don't expect it to blow your mind, but you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality you are getting for less than $40.",2020,07
"The keyboard is definitely quiet.  But the enter key is in an awkward position.  If you learned how to type and don't hunt and peck, you will constantly be hitting the slash key, rather than the enter key.  This gets very frustrating when trying to type reports and documents.  It has a nice look, and my kids thought it was cool with the colors.  But sadly, it was returned due to it not being practical for my needs",2020,07
"I've used this for a few months. It worked great at first. It would die on me after a few hours of using, so I was pretty good about plugging it in when I wasn't using it. Now, it just sometimes straight up doesn't work, which gets pretty frustrating. I'll even try to keep the power chord plugged in, and turn it off and on again, and it still doesn't work. That is very inconvenient. At that point, I'll just have to turn it off, keep it plugged in, and take a break from whatever I'm doing.",2020,07
"I received the keyboard with a defective dongle. I had talk to the customer service about it and they were very nice and helpful. I received a new one a few weeks later and the new one doesnt work either. I looked up how to sync it with the keyboard and after many attempts, it just wont work. I'm sad because the keyboard looks cool and I would very much like to use it. Maybe it's just my luck of getting defective receivers.",2020,07
"The 3 things I hate about this keyboard were mentioned in the reviews, but I overlooked them. This product is not made in the USA even though there is an American flag displayed suggesting it is. The supplied cable is only 2 feet long and does not insert fully into the keyboard, so factor in  the price of a  6 foot cable that does insert, as I had to do. Finally the keyboard lights time out after a minute of non use, EVEN if you leave it plugged in and battery life is not an issue.",2020,07
Great colors! My son loves it. Easy to push keys great size.,2020,07
"I bought this for my xbox one. Works great, looks beautiful!",2019,12
"I didn’t buy this to game but, to use with my MacBook that is connected to my multiple screens. Liked it b/c of the lit up keys. I find them to be hard to push and not comfortable. I guess I could just be used to my Mac keyboard and just being too hard on how the keyboard is supposed to function. I would like for it to stay lit up all the time while it breathes (lights up as if it were breathing)! I guess I can understand why it doesn’t. I like it and would recommend it though. It is relatively plug and play even on my Mac. Works a lot better for sure on Windows systems for all the other functions of the keys.",2020,07
quick working after one month,2020,07
"I love this keyboard.  I have poor eyesight and if I for get where a key is while touch typing, the letters on the keys are big enough so I don't have trouble seeing them.  Also the keypresses are very quiet.",2020,07
I had a solid green back-lit keyboard that stopped working. I wanted another solid color but I could not find one.  So I bought this one that has a multi-color back light. I have to say I like it better.  Also the keys feel much more substantial and it has an on off switch that I like as well.  Works from a decent distance also.  Recommend.,2020,07
The window passed to return :(//used for a week .... Really need to press the buttons to get it to work..irritatingBetter action on a cheap corded board...,2020,07
"Like the light weight and wireless.Battery life is good too.Too bad today my A and L buttons stopped working, I have tried in my laptop and my PC and both have the same results. I guess since I am out of my return window I will try to contact the company and see if they will service it and if not I will just open it up myself and see what has gone wrong.Very disappointing that this keyboard lasted a few months!!! DO NOT BUY THIS",2020,07
Brought this for my son and he loves it. He takes it everywhere we go!!,2020,07
"Really nice feeling, I'm very happy with this keyboard!",2020,07
I absolutely love this keyboard. It's perfect for everyday business use as well as my gaming time.,2020,07
"Purchased back in November 2019, I thought this keyboard would have lasted a lot longer. When I first purchased the keyboard it worked fine on my PC. After a month it stopped working and gave a message saying the Bluetooth software is outdated.  I went to the KLIM website to update the Bluetooth by downloading a file that didn't work. I connected the keyboard to another PC still would not work. Literally the keyboard stopped working after a month due to the Bluetooth being outdated or not compatible. What a waste of money.",2020,07
"Ordered in May, T and Y key stopped working at the end of July.",2020,07
It works well but i wouldn’t call it ‘quiet’ which is a shame because that’s the main reason I bought this product.,2020,07
Keyboard only works off wireless setting and the usb cable does not allow for a wired connection with the pc.,2020,07
Lasted a whole 5 weeks before it quit working. Started acting up and finally just quit. Would not recommend,2020,07
"The keyboard initially works well and after a few minutes when you type one the text does not appear and I write several things and do not mark the text, it is a fault that affects my work 100%, regarding the colors it has two lighting modes, the first is so that it never turns off and without 3 colors on the keyboard and the second is so that it turns on and off, I thought the lighting was color by color, I will write the provider to help me with the key problem and that will depend on my qualification",2020,07
"Great keyboard! feels and looks good and comes with a nice little note! quiet, and a little small about 17 inches by 6 inches but connects quickly and holds a good charge too! Customer service is OUTSTANDING very happy with their warranty policy and they gave me a brand new keyboard when mine stopped working. If you need a gaming keyboard this is the one.",2020,07
This keyboard looks and feels amazing ! I really appreciated this company and the little deals they do! So underrated!!,2020,07
"The keyboard remains responsive and in perfect working order after a month of regular use. I do have a fancy Logitech  gaming keyboard with all the bells and whistles but I prefer the quiet keys of the KLIM. Quiet doesn't mean unresponsive in this case, the keys feels sturdy, and satisfying.I love that it uses USB -C for charging or wired gaming and the battery life is surprisingly long.",2020,07
"Pros: Everything about this keyboard is really good.• The keys are SUPER quiet like advertised. My pc gaming setup is right next to our bed so if I play at night when my wife is sleeping it does not wake her up because how silent the keys are.•The rgb light brightness controls are awesome too. Again allows me to keep the keyboard bright enough to see in dark without blinding me or my wife while she sleeps if I game at night.• The color tones of the rgb lights are very nice, pleasing to look at.Cons:• The keys feel “sticky” with every press. Feels as if there was a sticky substance holding down the keys for a fraction of a second when depressed. But only a little. Not too big of a deal but some gamers might find this very annoying.• There are only two (2) rgb light options to choose from, breathing effect and constant back lite. Would be nice if there were more lighting effect options.",2020,07
"Looking to buy other products from this seller, packaging was great and happy with the keyboard, easy to type and fits my style of simplistic, yet modern look/feel",2020,07
it is a handy keyboard,2020,07
Awesome keyboard,2020,07
"I have had alot of keyboards in my time. This one by far is the best for what i use it for. Quiet,, i love the sleep mode and it has very nice lights for nighttime use.",2020,06
Love it!,2019,12
When I bought this wireless keyboard I was expecting to be able to use my keyboard from my couch which is probably about 15” away from my computer MAX. I can’t get more than about 5 feet away before this terrible dongle starts to lose connection. I am using the same usb extender I had my Xbox one controller dongle on. So it was as far from the rest of my equipment as I could make it with direct line of site to my klim keyboard And still dropped the connection completely after about 10 feet. This is definitely only an okay keyboard if you are sitting at a desk right next to your computer. But needless to say I’m very disappointed.,2020,07
Love it!! Great keyboard at a great price. Don't hesitate to buy it.,2020,07
It stopped working after 30 days.,2020,07
"Nice looking keyboard, nice to type on, very easy to connect to a Mac, but I cannot type anything properly with an extra key near the ""Enter"" button where ""Enter"" or ""Return"" usually is!!!",2020,07
Easy to setup and use. Nice addition to my studio setup in progress.,2020,07
"I am very happy with this keyboard. I really like the quiet keys, it's comfortable, and it works great. The lights in the keyboard create a nice atmosphere. You can find the USB port and on and off switch on the underside of the keyboard.",2020,07
"No issues, I don't use the LEDs but I did cycle through them and they work fine",2020,07
I have had this for about a week and haven't had to charge it at all. Initial setup was a breeze.My primary use is for late night console gaming with limited or no ambient lighting.The brightness is just right for my usage making the keys easy to see and use.Switching between consoles is also a breese.,2020,07
Everything seems great so far.,2020,07
"UDPATE: You can't use control + shift together on the left side of the keyboard (quick tab opens, window movement). What an abusrd error. Do yourself a favor and buy a different keyboard.This keyboard hits all the nails except for the spacebar. It seems to be made of an entirely different plastic than the rest of the keyboard and is distractingly loud. If you're working in an office environment it's likely you'll get looks from your co-workers. It ruins the entire keyboard experience.",2020,07
The Enter and Backslash keys are not in the traditional locations.  Too bad because I really liked the travel of the keys.,2020,07
no comment,2020,07
"I love this keyboard!  Works great with my Xbox One. Happy to see a USB type C charging port in it. This is my first KLIM purchase but after seeing the quality of this keyboard and reading the note that came with it, it's definitely not going to be the last.",2020,07
I love the power save mode,2020,07
Great product and great response with questions.,2020,07
Wish it came with a more detailed user manual. It can do things not mentioned in the booklet,2020,07
Great product and for one with an injured wrist this makes everything so much easier. Make sure you charge this keyboard first and then put it to good use. I did this and it has been some time now and still running smooth. Love it!! Connectivity the works and the colors are all just awesome,2020,07
"Mine worked at first, but now it just lights up when I attempt to type.  Doesn't register the keys and doesn't work for gaming like I had hoped.  Ordered a little over a month ago and it barely works.  Really sad about my purchase and would recommend buying a higher quality keyboard.",2020,07
"I do wish that the sleep mode was a bit longer, as I worry that drains the battery life a bit. The first one I received needed to be replaced after a month. However, I LOVE this keyboard. I contacted the seller via their official website, not through Amazon, and they sent me a replacement free of charge. Great customer service. I use this keyboard about 8-10 hrs a day during the work week, and usually charge it every other day. It is nice that you can still use it while it is charging.I did not realize how loud my original office keyboard was until the first one of these died. I even messaged my coworkers and apologized. This keyboard is quieter than my original Dell keyboard. If I had to choose, I would buy a wired keyboard, only so I didn’t have to worry about charging. But I really love this keyboard. It’s easy to adapt, love the colors, love the layout, and Lolita with customer service is the best.",2020,06
this product was great but it started to no work this past sunday on the 5th of july i got it back on the 13th of may.. it doesnt turn on anymore nor does it charge.. i charged it up one time with the charging cord since ive got it,2020,06
"All in all this keyboard is pretty good. The key-stroke is a little long for my liking but I've grown accustomed to how hard to press the keys. At first I was missing a lot of letters onscreen, but after like a week the typing became easy.",2020,06
"The keyboard looks and feels great. But the issue is that at times while typing, or using any keys really, it just stops responding for a good while. This has lead me to charge it until the indicator turns off (fully charged), and it still does this. I’ve turned off the wireless and connected via usb and this still happens. So ultimately I would not recommend this because you kinda need to use all the keys at all times.",2020,06
The keyboard literally worked for three seconds and shut off,2020,06
Product just died after a few months.  Will no longer take a charge.  It’s just dead.,2020,06
I love this keyboard.  I can easily see the keys in the dark and the lighting effect is calm and inspirational.  :-),2020,06
Its amazing bought it for my dad so he can see the keyboard but I end up gaming on it instead,2020,06
I liked it until it died after 1 month. I contacted KLIM. They had me run some tests. They deciedef to replace it or give me a refund. When I responed I found their email address not good. I tried several times over several days with different emails. Same thing. It even came back using their email tool on their webpage. I contacted amazon. They gave me a refund. Amazon was great about it. I dont know what happened to KLIM.,2020,06
Hit the L key and it also types the W key. These keys aren’t even near each other.,2020,06
"The keyboard feels good when typing, it's accurate, the backlight is a good touch is a good touch and allows for typing in dark places. The size is good. My only complain is that the keyboard is not silent at all even though it advertises being so unless you do 10 words per minute then you won't be typing silently.",2020,06
"This is a good looking keyboard.  It is wireless with a SHORT USB C charging cable.  It can barely reach from my desktop to the USB port in the front of my computer!  Also, I WFH like many of us right now. I'm a tax accountant and HAVE to have 100% accuracy in everything I type!!  This keyboard has a LAG. Doesn't matter whether its on or off the charger. I type 90+ wpm and it cannot keep up. Due to the lag it also misses many digits from the 10 key keypad.  Due to this lag I had an unnoticed typo in a zip code, for an IRS form - my new boss was NOT HAPPY I missed this (which of course I shouldn't have except for the lag) and I almost lost my new job !!!When the keyboard is not being charged, it will start to freeze and lag and generally miss numbers and letters...then I realize i need to put it on the charger. So i plug it in and its working OK. Then next thing I know an hour or so later, it starts doing the same thing again, so i need to take it OFF the charger.  Then another hour or so it does it AGAIN now I need to put it on the charger. TERRIBLE! I've never had such a problem with a charger before EVER.  I wanted to return the product as it was NOT CHEAP! But looks like I have no option for return. I purchased on 5/8/20 and with the hullabaloo of a starting a new job, I hadn't realized I was slipping out of the exchange and return window.  Don't waste your $60!!!",2020,06
I don't have to turn on my night light because the backlit keyboard is sufficient enough me to see the keys (letters and numbers). The touch of the keyboard is quiet enough for my roommate to sleep soundly .,2020,06
Really looks and works Great. Will see how it holds up..,2020,06
"I'm using Microsoft Edge and I was concerned this keyboard won't work after reading the compatible OS, but I simply plugged in the usb after charging it, and it went to work right away! Love the lighted keys although I'm not a gamer, just for working late at night. For the price, I give it 5 stars.",2020,06
The rugrat loves it!,2020,06
"Cool and cheap, however just know buying a keyboard this cheap the battery life is not very good at all!",2020,06
"I bought this keyboard TWICE. Once 12 months ago and again a few weeks ago. I have two computers, one for work and one for personal use.  BOTH times when I moved the usb port from one computer to another, I received an error and my computer did not recognize the USB. I tried the internal usb ports along with the 2 hubs I have for each computer. Do not make the mistake I made - do not give this product a first chance.",2020,06
"I love the clicky-ness - I love the backlit lights BUT I'm extremely upset that I got a keyboard, USB  plugin for Bluetooth, yet no cord to charge the keyboard came with it. There weren't any instructions, just a keyboard, and a plugin.  I may have to return it so I can set the time out setting on the lights. Very frustrating and waste of time.",2020,06
"First, the American Flag and Corporation Website does not like to tell you where they make their products. I got the keyboard and it said ""Made in China"". Then proved it was ""Made in China"" by the keystrokes not working. I demanded my money back and warn anyone to avoid a China malfunctioning keyboard that pretends to be an American Product. Not cool.",2020,06
"I'm experiencing a lot of glitches with this keyboard. The worst is when typing text and using the enter key for a line break and it just wipes out the entire app and I loose everything.I've never had so many missed types as with this keyboard.I contacted KLIM support and they requested a short video of a random glitch, whoa?My recommendation is to avoid this keyboard and KLIM as they try to be witty and cute and that's not what you want when you have a high priced cheap Chinese keyboard marketed as a premium product.Simply read the one star reviews for the truth on this keyboard.",2020,06
Update~~~made my review to fast... keyboard has stopped working completely.  Charged fully but does not work/ type when connected to computer.  Even had my boyfriend who works in IT try to figure out if it was my pc and it for sure is not it's the keyboard. ~~~~ Smooth typing. Great to use for work. *******BUT be careful it would of stopped me from buying it if I knew it did this!*******Make sure you turn it off every night it will be dead the next day when you go to use it. That was the bad part. I forgot to turn it off after work one night and the next morning it died on me when I was typing with a customer on the phone and I had to fumble to find the power cord.,2020,06
"The Keyboard constantly lags and has issues with Bluetooth. Even when I connect directly via USB I have this lag issue. Sometimes the keyboard spazzes out while I'm working on something that requires extreme precision. If you are using this keyboard for coding, or sending important emails, then be warned that you might have connectivity issues.",2020,06
IT DIED!!!  ABOUT A WEEK AFTER RETURNABILITY.,2020,06
This keyboard is amazing! The lighting is awesome and when not in use the lights turn off so not waating battery life! Typing is great and awesome for gaming!,2020,06
"The keyboard works wonders! I love how accurate and speedy it is, and how it shuts off when not in use to save power! In addition to that, KLIM is such a wonderful company with EXCELLENT customer service. I had misplaced my wireless dongle (the little black usb piece that is for the keyboard) and they were more than happy to send me a new one at no extra charge. They even included a little french candy with my dongle! I LOVE KLIM!!",2020,06
"This keyboard is amazing! It came well packaged like a high quality item. And I feel like the little details matter when buying a product. I love the extra effort they made with the thick papered, high quality small envelope that had decals and stuff in it. The LEDs are bright and the keys are very quite. It also has holes in the bottom which is nice if you accidentally spill something on it. It has great wireless range. My desktop is hooked up to my TV and the couch is about 10-12 ft away and has no connection problems. Overall this is an amazing value for the low price and I'll continue buying from this company as I expand my home business into a larger business.",2020,06
Excellent wireless keyboard just what we needed.,2020,06
"Ok, so I love my new keyboard; however, there is one thing that is going to drive me crazy.Aside from by phone & watch, I am terrible about having to recharge things.  I am using this keyboard for work, and it's died on me twice. It's definitely my bad, but still, never had to worry about recharging a keyboard before.So if you are like me, you may want to reconsider, otherwise, no complaints.",2020,06
Bought this for my husband and he loves it and all the lights!,2020,06
My husband bought this keyboard for me and we both love it. Apparently according to him I am a heavy typer and I am loud AF when I type on a normal keyboard on this one he says he can’t hear anything.. which is awesome. I play wow and other pc games and for me the keybindings and lit up back helps a lot. It’s light seems durable and the company that supplies this sends the most awesome thank you letter for buying it. Lol the thank you letter was so funny and unique I seriously wish I could send the owner of the company a award for most unique thank you! It’s an awesome keyboard and if I needed another one would totally buy it again.,2020,06
Very good . I recommend this product,2020,06
"This keyboard was a great buy at $29 - I am forced to replace it 7 months later (keys getting soft, worn) which would have been fine at the $29 price point but now the price has almost DOUBLED - going to seek out a more reliable brand for slightly more money",2020,06
"I like the sleep feature for battery preservation, as well as the backlight. It's smart about how it manages all of that. The range is great, I'm able to use this from about 10' away in my living room for use with the big screen while my laptop was tucked away under/in my entertainment center. Works well while charging (if needed) also. Highly responsive while gaming, no delays noted.",2020,06
My grad daughter loves this keyboard. She purchased with her grad money! The price was right and shipped was fast.,2020,06
"I wanted to like this colorful keyboard. Unfortunately, after troubleshooting for ages I have been unable to fix this problem. The keyboard literally just stopped working. Lights shut off and no connectivity regardless of the USB being connected. Regardless of restarting and updating my computer. I tried different USB ports on the off chance it was my computer, but they are all working for other USB connected products. I have unfortunately come to the conclusion that the problem isn't my computer, but the keyboard. I don't know if I can return it this far out but I will try.",2020,06
All reviews that said this keyboard is quiet or silent are liars,2020,06
"Item worked fine for a month or two of light use and all the sudden it just doesn't work thought the battery was dead sonI charged it, nothing. If I turn the switch off and on again it lights up for about a millisecond n goes dark again 0 keys work. Tried to contact amzon becuse the only option it gives is return but am outside of the 30 day window, but there not taking phone calls at this time, guess I wasted money I n this one. They do have an updated 2020 version keyboard that came out with right after I purchased this one but I wouldnt waste my money after this bad experience.",2020,06
This keyboard is very comfortable to use and the lights are not too bright. Love the layout of the colors. It seems to be very quick response when playing games.,2020,06
Keys feel good under your fingers RGB is very cool,2020,06
Packaging from amazon  was not great box a split wide open surprisingly no damage.,2020,06
"I love the colors, feel of the keyboard, and how quiet it is. Only other thing was the shortcut keys. I didn't like not being able to change some of the shortcut keys on the board. Got in my way in some of my apps.  Didn't get much beyond that because the battery didn't last very long had to recharge it too soon. Sent it back due to the battery issue.  Other than the battery, the keyboard was great. I give it 4 stars, but reduced to 3 because of the battery.",2020,06
I bought this keyboard for my son and he loves it. It lights up when he is using it and the lights go off when he isn't. The keyboard is quiet and it isn't too big. Really good buy.,2020,06
Works great! My 11 year old enjoys playing with this using his xbox!,2020,06
Stopped working less than a month after purchase.,2020,06
My daughter loved her new wireless keyboard,2020,06
What's the point of being wireless if I need to keep it plugged in for power all the time? Also why do the lights go to sleep so quickly? The writing on the keys is so light that I can't see them unless a light is shining all them.,2020,06
Great item,2020,06
"I like this keyboard.  It does everything I want it to do and I like the color scheme(I don't think that's changeable, but I could be wrong).  The only real problem I've had with the keyboard is that it will turn off with no warning that it's low on battery.  It also has a good feel to the buttons.",2020,06
"the enter key is hard to press after a month on these keyboards, i tried two of them but no difference.  im not out of the return window and am stuck with it....",2020,06
Great value for the money for an illuminated wireless keyboard. Very responsive.,2020,06
"For the price this object is probably my favorite keyboard I have ever had. It response great, has had no issues using plug-n-playing in different laptops, plugs, in and gets to working quickly. So far I have only charged it a couple hours two separate times and have been using it for constantly playing games since i bought it a month or more ago. So....my battery life in my personal experience with this has been amazing.I recommend this product, it is built much MUCH better that the few other KLIM products I have tested out. Well worth the money. That is my two cents, you do your research decide.",2020,05
"I bought the keyboard so I could play games in the living room and it was working fine. The lights were really pretty, the keys felt clean, and it was pretty easy to move around. However, less than a month after I bought it, the backspace key, L key, and R key stopped working.",2020,05
"Works very well, lights up looks great.  Maybe sleeps too soon...no big deal though.",2020,05
So far I love it,2020,05
"The keyboard came today and so far I'm really enjoying it. Looks sleek and feels nice. For the price I'd say that this is a great buy. No problems to report, but it's only day one. Came very fast!",2020,05
I love the overall look and functionality wirelessly as well as rechargeable. Love the colors.,2020,05
"I would not recommend this keyboard, I loved it at first until the keys started breaking just from typing....7-broken keys in the first month alone",2020,05
"Love being able to toss it on the bed when I'm deep into my hobbying and need some space. Wish the backlight stayed on a bit longer, but then I'd probably have to charge it more. Have no problem recommending this keyboard at all.",2020,05
"I'm pretty happy with this keyboard...except for one thing.  The ENTER key spans two lines and the pipe button is moved down a line.  This small feature really slows down my typing (especially in a UNIX environment).  I just can't seem to get past that.  Hopefully in time I will but switching between keyboards will likely be an issue.  Other than that...they key board lights up nice, holds a charge, is fairly easy to type on (I wish the keys were like 10% bigger) and I haven't tried swimming with it so I can't speak to the water proof part.  I can't exchange it because I already recycled the box.  I'll make it work for now.",2020,05
This is the second keyboard that I've ordered. Both had issues.  Very disappointing product.,2020,05
This is a great keyboard for wireless quiet typing. I really like the use of the colors.,2020,05
"It often stops working at random points. Even with a full charge there will be sudden fits where it won't respond for a good 3 seconds or it will be super laggy with its  inputs. I was an idiot, forgot it had warranty, and bought 2. the first one at least had the courtesy to wait a few months to bug out. Day 1 this thing bugged.But, I like the feel of the keyboard. Its a damn satisfying keyboard WHEN IT WORKS. The buttons are nice to press and the keyboard feels nice in general. That's why i bought another hoping the first was faulty. The lights are nice also. But I sadly cant recommend it if 2 keyboards have similar bugs. Hell, even typing this out was an ordeal(especially when i was listing the positives of it). I will be sending it to repairs, but i really hope they straighten this problem out.",2020,05
This keyboard has a nice look and feel. At 73 my eyes aren't what they used to be and this makes life a lot easier. The back lighting is adjustable. I spend a lot of time printing photo for the Grand Kids.,2020,05
Keys have a very smooth travel,2020,05
Sucks that $50 buys you a keyboard that just dies after a couple weeks. I know this only happens to some people that buy the product so if you wanna roll the dice go ahead.,2020,05
"The key board looks amazing, but some of the keys don't work. B,N, and Delete, to name a few.",2020,05
"This keyboard looks really good, but the description is deceiving as they claim it to be silent or quiet. This keyboard is so not close to being a quiet one. It has really loud keys which I wasnt a fan of.",2020,05
"Someone has missed the point - there doesn't seem to be a way to ""keep the lights on"" either wirelessly (which is the point of purchasing a wireless keyboard) or wired - not a power saving move as the shut off timing is the same with the keyboard plugged in - the backlighting when it is on is not helpful as it barely shows through the key to highlight the number or letter but shows off the space around the keys, so when looking down on the keyboard the eye is drawn to the space around the keys instead of the key itself - completely uselessA strange design choice also interferes with the use of the keyboard - there is an extra key next to the ""enter/return"" which is really annoying - instead of hitting enter you are more likely to hit backslash which really makes entering passwords a joy - this key is above the enter key on every other keyboardA very bad choice on my part from all the wireless backlit keyboards available",2020,05
"I was looking for a low profile keyboard, wireless and with a large ""enter Key""  This keyboard fits the bill..",2020,05
"PROS: The physical design of the keyboard is great.  Feedback on the keys is good, has a nice matte finish, lights are as advertised, and there are holes on the back of the keyboard which helps keep the keys clean and if you spill a liquid on it it can drain.CONS: A couple times a days the keyboard will disconnect intermittently on me.  It will become unresponsive and disconnect then reconnect rapidly.  Its not for very long, maybe 30 seconds to couple minutes and if I'm at the computer for 8 hours a day it will only happen a couple times.  But if I'm in the middle of a game it can be quite frustrating.  Never have had this issue with other wireless keyboards.  Not sure what the solution is but I tried reinstalling the driver.",2020,05
This POS is advertised as made in USA.  It is actually made in China.,2020,05
"Goes into sleep mode too quicklyNo problem really, seems to be a good quality product",2020,02
" There are a few good things about this keyboard: lights, number keys, wireless, rechargeable, but the space bar is a major deal breaker for me. I was looking for a quiet keyboard to take notes during videoconferencing. The space bar is annoyingly loud. Even when typing without having to be quiet on a conference call, it is very annoying. My partner down the hall can here me typing. Good features on this keyboard but I really cannot stand the space bar. It's an instant return for me. The worst part is they market this as a ""quiet"" keyboard. It's far from quiet.",2020,05
This is a great value!!  I am using with my laptop as I dont like the keyboard on my laptop.  Love this!!,2020,05
So far it works great hope it stays like that.,2020,05
The keyboard feels steady. The wireless connection is excellent. I just wish that the hand rest was at least 3 inches long since I use it on my lap.,2020,05
"I enjoy the snarkiness of the ppwk in the package.  Minus the space bar, all of the keys are very quiet.  I gave it a full charge before use- it worked immediately.  Backlighting turns off after its idle for a bit, a simple tap of any key wakes it up. I dig that the backlighting is multi-colored v. just plain white. Being that I'm not planning to use it for gaming, I'm going to need to get used to the shape of the 'enter' key. There is an additional key on the middle row where I would naturally hit enter. No biggie.  Minus 1 star because the space bar is quite loud.",2020,05
Great gaming keyboard,2020,05
We love it.,2020,05
I have not had to charge the keyborad or the mouse. I am on my computer a lot and I am still running the both of them from the time I first intalled the.,2020,05
"Like, I use it for music production. It serves it purpose to Elevate the mood in room while creating Music compositions etc👍🏿",2020,05
"Crap quality. Several keys fell off when it was being stored (not even in use)  and are now lost, rendering the keyboard useless. $30 down the drain!",2020,05
"Bluetooth range is no problem, RGB color is good, keys are comfortable to use, but TWO keys stopped working. I use the ""cue"" key for gaming, so this basically defeats the purpose of buying this keyboard.",2020,05
So Basically I Was Testing The Removable Keycaps To see if the they actually Worked so I tried it on the space bar and after I Took it out I Couldn’t Get It Back In And When I Got It Back In It Kept Falling out Idk If this was my fault or the keyboards Fault.,2020,05
 Love the colors! Love that it can be plugged in or wireless! Love it with my keyboard as well!,2020,05
Works great,2020,05
"What I like, Everything.What I dislike, Nothing.This review is actually the first thing that I'm typing with this new keyboard. The keys feel a little spaced out, but I've been stuck with tiny bluetooth keyboards using my phone as my computer. Which, this works flawlessly with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G, and with the Dex setup, which I'm currently utilizing.I feel like I purchased a much more expensive keyboard than what I paid for this, the packaging and items inside are esquisite, the glow of the keyboard is bright, and fantasticly appealing. I wish this had a bluetooth format, but maybe the next Note 20+ will feature connectivity to 2.4ghz devices.",2020,05
After less than 3 months it’s already broken. Space bar is already busted :(  son had last keyboard for 2 years and never had an issue.  Very bummed.,2020,05
"This Keyboard looks fantastic especially with the breathing setting. But the connectivitiy is garbage. It makes gaming fristrating because the keybiard will lag, you will put in an input and it will take a few seconds to register if it registers at all. There is also no indicator if it is about to die. Fully charged it still lags.",2020,05
"Works fine. Easy to install and use, but there is nothing ""quiet"" about this keyboard. It clacks along just like a regular one not advertised as quiet.",2020,05
Although there is a large American flag pictured on the product description this keyboard is made in China. Nowhere in the description does it say that. I paid a premium for this keyboard for it to be made in the US and this is just false advertising.,2020,05
"Well just saying not sure why the price is expensive besides the lights on background of keys it is the same basic keyboard you will find in the wireless section. I bought cause of how cool it looks. Also you have to keep charging the keyboard to ensure it is fully juiced up, so make sure you turn it off on the bottom so it wont die. I have not had to many times it died on me, but how often do you remember to cut your keyboard off or plug it up. Other than that item is perfect.",2020,05
Highly recommended,2020,04
POS. Won't hold a charge after 3 months of light use. Can't return,2020,04
This is an excellent keyboard and exactly what I was looking for.  The keys are extremely responsive and I like the low profile of the keyboard.  Also the keys are extremely quiet and the different color lighting is cool.  Easy function button combinations controls functions such as turning the color lighting off or adjusting the dimness/brightness of the lighting. The packaging is great and I liked the message the company provides in a black envelope along with the stickers.  This product works great with a KVM switch.  Highly recommend.,2020,04
"I had never heard of this brand and was a little concerned I might be buying some weird off brand that was of poor quality. So glad that's not the case. This keyboard is all quality. They keys feel amazing to type on. The lighting comes with a few options (like adjusting brightness), and the whole thing feels sturdy. Set up was easy (of course). I was reading through the few inserts that come in the packaging, and there's even a cute description of how the keyboard was shipped to me.",2020,04
I like the color and function of this key board .,2020,04
I bought this keyboard for work. I wanted something quiet but also had rgb even tho there is only the basic rainbow and it's not very bright. For the price this keyboard is well worth it. It's very light for easy travel and the keys also feel surprisingly nice to type on for long periods.,2020,04
Love the lights!,2020,04
I have problems with this keyboard just deciding that I am not pushing the buttons anymore.  Even when leaving the keyboard connected directly to the computer at times it just stops responding and its incredibly frustrating when trying to game.,2020,04
I actually use this keyboard for my workstation and it’s super awesome I love it and I don’t know what else to say about this product it’s super fun and it lights up when you’re typing and it’s awesome,2020,04
Fantastic keyboard for its price,2020,04
"I'm surprised how highly rated this keyboard is given that the space bar isn't quiet as advertised. This isn't a manufacturing defect; it's the actual design. Besides that problem, the enter key is a whole key further away compared to most keyboards. I found myself repeatedly pressing where the key should be, but that place is occupied by the backslash. Another problem is that in Ubuntu 18.04 the keyboard shortcut for create a new folder doesn't work on this keyboard.",2020,04
"It's a really great keyboard, the only thing I don't like is that you are unable to change the color, other than that it's perfect.",2020,04
You will be needing to charge this Keyboard EVERY day.  I've had keyboards that lasted for months on a single charge.  This is definately not one of them.  Other than that it's a great keyboard.,2020,04
The M Key doesn’t work! Pretty hard to do anything when a pretty important letter is not able to be used.,2020,04
"Ok product for price point. Wish battery lasted longer. The keys are a little awkward. Have to press harder than a normal keyboard. But for the price, I’m happy. Love it in the dark. Wish you could change the rainbow effect to a solid color, but happy overall. I use it for work, so I cannot give a full review for gaming. But I did like the fact no software needed to be installed.",2020,04
"Looked nice while it lasted, but it wouldn't charge after two months of light use.",2020,04
"I've bought this keyboard twice now.  It works great... for a few months.  Honestly, it is my favorite keyboard I've used so when my first one went out after about 3 months I bought another.  Unfortunately, that one lasted four months and konked out as well.  It just does this thing where it flickers on for a second then turns right off.  Would love to buy another one but don't know if I can justify buying a keyboard that I now assume I will have to repurchase in another 3-4 months :/",2020,04
Its amazing,2020,04
"Lightweight, nice looking, wireless, fair price, but it's stopped working after less than a year. Really liked this keyboard, but I'm dealing with a keyboard that is outputting constant characters to the computer and I can't imagine how to fix it. If I turn this on it locks up my computer and tries typing numbers and odd ASCII characters. Shame!",2020,04
"After using this as an everyday keyboard for six months now there are a few problems with. Even with a full charge the keyboard will randomly power off, have missed keystrokes and there's no way to tell how much charge is left in the battery. It is quiet however but I wouldn't use it as an everyday keyboard.",2020,04
Some keys stopped working 2 months of use. I contacted the KLIM for assistance and I was not able to get the keyboard exchanged for a new one. I will no longer purchase any electronics from KLIM.,2020,04
"Great product!! My 14 year old is new to gaming & loves his keyboard. The colors are fantastic. He had a great time with the included product stickers decking out his pc casing, headphones, etc. plus the letter/product literature that came with the keyboard personalizes the product. You feel a connection to the folks who put their TLC into the product. Thx!",2020,04
"Have been using it nonstop since I got it. The look of the keyboard is super sleek and nice. Love the colors and the auto shut off of the lights when not being used. Has a type c charger so it works great with your phone charger if you have an android phone. Keys do not make noise which is nice. Connected quickly to my laptop, no problems at all. Wish the company would make a wireless mouse to go with this keyboard though.",2020,04
Has a great design and excellent features.,2020,04
I really love this keyboard. For the price I could not have asked for a better one!,2020,04
"everything is perfect but the whole point while i got this was because its wireless. but wireless is useless if theres no reception after 3 feets.after a year or so i can't remember, it stopped working. all it does now is just flashing light back and forth when i try to type something in...",2020,04
"Overall it is a good keyboard. but it runs out of battery really fast.My own does not hold on for more than 3 or 4 days. I would expect to hold the battery for 3 or 4 weeks, or even months.Every week I have to connect into the USB port to recharge.When connected to USB port, I still have to connect the bluetooth adapter. which makes me use an extra USB port.Why not just use the USB cabe to also communicate with the PC? why do I have to use both while charging the keyboard?",2020,04
The USB receiver got stuck in my laptop USB port. I ended up having to get it out with pliers. Fortunately this didnt cause any damage to the USB port. Very disappointed in this product as the keyboard no longer works AT ALL and it almost damaged my 1200$ laptop. The USB receiver came out in pieces at a time and I'm not sure if it even functioned properly to begin with. It most definitely doesn't function now.,2020,04
It seemed fine at first but then i tried to type the @ sign eventually I figured out it was on another key not great if your only using it for gaming its a good keyboard (if you using chat it wouldn't be great),2020,03
Keyboard did not want to work even after turning it on and off and restarting my computer USB was plugged in but i could not type a word I even tried charging it and still nothing and i just got it today. When I went to settings it showed the keyboard was there but wasn't allowing me to type or even change the brightness of the lights on keyboard,2020,04
Good quality,2020,04
Awesome,2020,04
The keyboard did not function correctly the moment I opened plugged it. Some of the keys just don’t work. I received a broken keyboard and it’s a pain to return due to Covid-19.,2020,04
"A solid keyboard for the price. The battery life is not very good and if you use your computer a lot, it sort of defeats the purpose of it being wireless. The keys are not silent although they are more quiet than most standard keyboards. The backlighting provides a nice visual but contributes to the poor battery life on a single charge; however, the light level makes the keys very visible in a dark or dimly lit room. If the RGBs are important to you, consider a keyboard with more programmability because this one can only switch between off, on, and glow with options to toggle light level and glow frequency.",2020,04
"Overall a great keyboard, and rechargeable too. The computer doesnt give you Any warning whatsoever when the battery is low or dead so it might cut out mid-use. Similarly, the battery life isn't stellar, but that's to be expected of a light-up keyboard. Overall a good value at its price point.",2020,04
"I like the raised keys, I’m not using for gaming but for work. What I dislike is that it doesn’t have a setting for backlight to stay on which is what I wanted.",2020,04
"I don't use this for gaming and haven't used the sleep mode so can't really rate it. I like the way it lights up and it's a good keyboard. Only issue is I lost the charging cable and can't seem to find a replacement, not even on their website. I do recommend this though.",2020,04
"It's fairly bright, but you're stuck with the one rainbow color pattern, and some of the colors are not as bright as others, making typing in the dark a harder than it should be. The keys are raised up and beveled like a keyboard from 20 years ago, so the striking surface is smaller than on newer keyboards. This makes typing and accuracy a little slower. Some of the keys are placed a little weird, too. The key to the left of the ENTER key usually has the apostrophe and quotation mark. This one has the backslash and vertical line. As I was used to my last keyboard, I kept putting backslashes where apostrophes should be. I'll likely be replacing this soon.",2020,04
"fast shipped, love it the keyboard!! Works great!!",2020,04
works great! i only use the usb to connect it to my ps4 and no problems so far using the wireless!,2020,04
"Very cool keyboard. It’s easy to the eye at night when using. I would recommend this item to friends, family and anyone else interested.",2020,04
Office work,2020,04
"Great compact keyboard with 10-key.  Easy to type on, not noisy.  Plug & Play setup. Love the colors and breathing effect is very calming.  No issues for me!",2020,04
I needed a wireless keyboard for a reasonable price and fast shipping PLUS this one brightens my home office. I'd buy it again and again. Happy with my purchase.,2020,04
Very cool. My 13 year old son loves it. He changes the colors and even turns the color off.,2020,03
This keyboard was easy to set up. However the user manual that you can download is not in English. Use the FN key to adjust the lights. Very cool keyboard.,2020,03
I can't trust this keyboard to type read every key I type.  It constantly misses letters and entering hidden passwords are a pain because you don't know if the keyboard even registered the key you hit.,2020,03
Cant use it while its plugged in? I use a laptop so i have little room for usb (mouse and keyboard) and it doesn’t work while its plugged in charging Or atleast thats what ive found,2020,03
"This is a cool wireless gaming keyboard. I love the fact that it lights up , however it has an internal battery that needs to be charged too often.",2020,03
Purchased this keyboard for looks and for work. It does the job nicely as a regular low demanding keyboard. Haven't game with it yet but I could see it doing just fine. Doesn't feel like a real mechanical keyboard. Feels very plasticy and not the most high-end keyboard out there. The lights only have 2 modes which are breathing and always on. The lights are fixed as the same colors as well. I only bought this since it's cheap and it looks cool. If you want a simple yet cool looking keyboard then this is good. However if you want something a lot more then look elsewhere.,2020,03
Buttons stick. Would not buy,2020,03
"This is a fair to middling keyboard, the back lighting only works when it is plugged in.. some folks think the back lighting is just a gimmicky bling thing, but in a darkened room its necessary and if you go cordless, no back light! I would rather have a truly cordless model with lots of batteries, I prefer the heft, this one is very light adding to a sense of cheapness. it is compact. still room for improvement. I will try another when I tire of this one, still searching for the one I would re order, this ain't it, but still a reasonable value.",2020,03
"Great product, I have nothing bad to say about this product worth every penny.",2020,03
Had an issue with this after a couple months. Contacted the KLIM support and they were great to work with and replaced the product promptly.,2020,03
It reached my expectations it's a good products I definitely recommend.,2020,03
"Totally deceptive-they raised the price, what a joke! Nothing makes me more mad than when a company puts american flags all over their listing and the label on the box says MADE IN CHINA. Why? Because this is deceptive marketing. Even if the box didnt say this, how do I know? Because the letter E key didnt work and the power switch was stuck. Immediate return-DO NOT BUY.",2020,03
It doesn't have a solid lighting.  Doesn't match my red themed pc/mouse/mousepad setup.,2020,03
Great keyboard. Am able to connect from another room without direct line of sight. Response time is excellent. It does miss a key from time to time but I attribute that to range and signal penetration and it's really not an imposition. But best of all the manufacturer is both very responsive and helpful and also have a great sense of humor.Edit. spilled a little coffee on it today. the keyboard immediately spazzed out. turned it off took it apart and cleaned and dried all of it. still broken. suffice it to say waterproof is not what this is.,2020,03
Outstanding product and customer service.  Thanks!,2020,03
"This is an awesome keyboard, but what triggered my purchase was that I thought it was water proof.. Not sure how I got that idea... I think some reviews I had read were making a mistake of saying water proof and not water resistant. I had also read 2 reviews on another site that mentioned a silicon sealed internals, and the keyboard has quite a few HOLES in it... They are very well engineered for liquid to run onto and through the keyboard, drying it very quickly. I have 2 INQUISITIVE pet birds that knock stuff over all the time onto my keyboards, and are also fascinatd with stomping around on the keys, seems to be a weird fascination with most larger birds I have seen.. So the idea of a keyboard I could just wash in the sink was AWESOME. Except that it ISN'T. I have ran into a few other people that have made the same assumption and instant destruction of an awesome keyboard as myself. I woulodn't even really call it Water resistant.. The board, the battery, wires, and well EVERYTHING is jsimply placed inside with no covering or anything.. WHile the drainage heoles do help mitigate spill damage, the internal components seem very ill e quiped for moisture of any typ. My keyboard died quite instantly upon wiping it down with a damp rag, a bit on the wet side.. though rung out quite a bit. So, be careful. This was a selling point that somehow got very confusing, which failed upon light testing of the water resistance.",2020,03
"It has been about 5 months and this keyboard completely stopped working.This lights are broken (they don't stay on, and the light fr caps lock doesn't turn on.) Not to mention it won't type whatsoever anymore. I do NOT recommend this keyboard.",2020,03
"Works well and as expected. Packaging is nice and is pretty simple plug and play. I do wish it would have a solid back light feature and not just the rainbow / multi colored as I think it would look more professional for an office setting, but other wise Im pleased with it.",2020,03
Does not hold a charge for more than a week. Half the time you hit a key it doesn't register. I should not have gone with the cheaper model.,2020,03
"Great for ps4. Lacks macro buttons. Looks great, but cant change the light effects.",2020,03
It works good!,2020,03
I wish I could adjust the sleeping mode timing.,2020,03
excellent for the price. lighted keyboard keys are great! quiet key clicks. responsive.,2020,03
I bought this keyboard with limited expectations. I was completely surprised at how good it really is. Can’t beat it for the price.,2020,03
Fits my needs,2020,03
bright enough for night play and no batteries to replace,2020,03
Very quick delivery. Nice keyboard. Simple to setup,2020,03
"Product came in a good box along with a humorous company statement. However, everything afterwards was a dismay. The wireless keyboards has a lot of lag. The simplest way to describe it is: I’m a pretty decent gamer and I’m getting owned by noobs because of this system. Don’t even get me started on just using it for daily mundane tasks (check and write emails). The system would lag so much that I would rather write a whole essay in my cellphone and send it that way.",2020,03
"I purchased two of these, one works 95% of the time. I get some ghost keys and missed keys, but it is something I can live with. This second keyboard though, wow, just wow. Maybe half the keys work, at most. I charged it up, tried multiple computers, OSes, etc. Same result, I get maybe half the keys working. It is very random too as to when it happens and which keys. Spend a little extra and get something that is actually worth it and if you are worried about accuracy, buy wired.",2020,03
"I've been using mechanical boards for a while, and I randomly used a non mechanical one that I found in my closet and realized I like it way more. So I went to Amazon to find a better quality non mechanical board and found the Corsair k55 which was $80, but then I saw this board for only $40, so I tried this one out. No complains whatsoever yet. Typing feels great, fast response time, very lightweight and wireless has been flawless.Update: Been using this now for 2 1/2 years, still has no issues and works great",2020,03
"Honestly couldn't be happier with it. Hadn't heard of the company before, but the receipt of this keyboard made me an instant fan. Quality product at a fair price, and they seem to be sincere in putting customer service first. And it came with metal stickers! One immediately went on my PC. 10/10 will buy more of their products.Update: After a couple of years the charging port broke, but the keyboard was still under warranty and they sent me a brand new one. Absolutely wonderful customer service. Still a 10/10 experience.",2020,03
"Nice, springy keys that are smooth to type. Comfortable arrangement and I like the backlight. Also, very thoughtful letter from the manufacturers.Would highly recommend. Keep it up.",2020,03
Volume control doesn't work On this keypad,2020,03
"This keyboard was great and effective at first, I've had it for about 4 months before it started having connectivity issues. The keyboard is not communicating anymore and the keystrokes are not showing up on my screen. The window to return this item closed 2 months ago, so I'm stuck with this keyboard that I will be recycling. Be wary of this product.",2020,03
"I went through a lot of wireless keyboards but this on is right on top  of themThe lights are nice and non-intrusive ,the battery life is long and the keys are quiet.Very nice keyboard for gaming and anything in between.",2020,03
"Overall, I really like the product. The response time is awesome for typing, gaming, and more. I would give this product a solid 4 or 5 stars, however, I only got it in late December 2019 to replace a keyboard I had for 2 or 3 years. I have now had this keyboard for a total of 3 months and already the on/off switch is starting to fail. I have to turn it on and off several times before it will turn on. Sometimes it won't come back out of sleep mode, causing me to have to turn it off and back on again, repeating the process a few times until it finally works. Once it's on, it works great. I honestly expected more out of a product that cost me 50+ dollars. I have had logitec and other brands of keyboards throughout the years and they generally last me a couple of years at least. While I really enjoy this keyboard overall, the short term  time it took for it to start degrading is unfortunate. I am hopeful that mine is just a bad one rather than it being the standard because the range, response time, and lighting on this keyboard is awesome otherwise. I have had 30 and 40 dollar keyboards that lasted longer. The return window ended in January, so I guess I will be looking for a new keyboard that serves my needs better.",2020,03
Works as described.,2020,03
"Advertisement says three backlit effects, and it is not true... Overall not a bad keyboard, but marketing is a fraud...",2020,03
I just started a work from home job and this keeps my workspace reliably functional and fun! Would absolutely recommend!,2020,03
"I am really disappointed with this keyboard. At first it was great, but within a month or two the keyboard started to glitch. Certain buttons do not work when I press them. Considering the price of the product I was happy, but not if it stops working after two months.",2020,03
Good Keyboard just make sure you do not loose that charger or you will have a hard time charging it.,2020,03
Stopped working within a week. I had hoped for better.,2020,03
This keyboard is not silent. The keys do click not as loud as the other keyboards I’ve had..but this is why I bought it to be soundless. I know keyboards won’t be 100% silent but I can’t tell why they put that in their description when it’s just as loud as other keyboards. Also when you aren’t typing and the lights are showing you can hear a humming sound coming from the board and it doesn’t go away until the lights shut off. I do live the lighted keyboard just wish it a bit more quiet.,2020,03
This is a really nice wireless keyboard if you don't need too many bells a whistles. I game on my TV so I sit pretty far away and haven't had trouble with connectivity yet. The rgb is simple but nice and switching between the different modes is easy.,2020,03
"I use this keyboard with my laptop for work. It’s much more comfortable for me to type on than the mall laptop keyboard. Silent and has a good touch. Great reactivity and the lights are fun. I don’t use it for gaming, but as a working keyboard it’s great!",2020,03
"Quick and easy set up. Just unbox and plug into USB port then game away. Charging cord is a little short but it does has a Samsung S9 charging port (not sure what type it is, maybe C?) so getting a longer charging cord is no issue. No lag between key presses and was shipped in a good sturdy box with stickers and personal note from company.",2020,03
Use this product for PC gaming it is great! I was expecting issues by now since it was so inexpensive but it holds up well I do recommend this keyboard for any gamer that is looking to go wireless and on a budget!,2020,03
"I was excited to try a wireless keyboard, and really thought I would like this. Battery life would last about a full day and a half, but it charged fast. The lights made it easy to type at night, which was also a bonus. Typing with it was sort of annoying noisy, but could have forgiven that if the product was actually decent. After a few weeks, the typing just got completely laggy, and every few keystrokes missed. It became impossible to type on. Plugging it in with the charge wire didn't fix the problem, so I switched back to my old wired keyboard. Waste of money for how fast this broke down.",2020,03
Some keyboards have very flat keys and I have a hard time feeling the keys. These are great because the keys are slightly recessed in the middle.,2020,03
"This is such an excellent product! It’s quiet, it in no way ever bothers my carpal tunnel, and the colors are rich and vibrant. The battery charge lasts for quite some time too.Additionally, the customer service is second to none. My USB dongle sadly disappeared in a move, and they replaced it, free of charge no less, within days of my email to tech support. They provided ample instructions on how to sync the new receiver and even included candy in the package as a friendly touch. I cannot brag enough about how great KLIM is!",2020,03
"I've hooked this up to my PS4 to use while I'm playing FFXIV, and it seamlessly works to type better than the controller does. I still have to use the controller to get to the chat box, but that doesn't bug me. Love the coloring. Great for use in the dark.",2020,03
I love the colors. Its a super quiet keyboard. Great quality!,2020,03
"I mainly purchased this to use in a very dimly lit area, the keys are not quite illuminated enough for me, other than that its great.",2020,02
I use this for gaming. Works great with no issues. Battery life isn't horrible considering it lights up. If also like to add that the company has great customer service!,2020,02
"This is an amazing keyboard!!!!! Silent keystrokes, backlit that isn’t blinding or distracting. Super high quality! And the best part of all....it’s rechargeable!!!!!!",2020,02
"So far, i have been satisfied with the keyboard and would recommend it to others. the one issue is the special cord to recharge the keyboard and the ability to match the lighting to my laptop. I do understand the limits on the battery life that prevent the keyboard from staying active all the time but I would like to be able to dim the keyboard when inactive but with the light still bright enough or at least a marker key to engage the lights to make it easier to see in the dark. It may be a little nit picky but the purpose of the lights is to allow me to see and enjoy the back-lights while playing and not have to stop and turn on a light just to re-orient my self to the keys while trying to immerse myself in a game.",2020,03
"I'd buy it again, it looks nice and feels nice.",2020,03
I got this to use at work because wireless works a lot better for my desk set up. I've had no issues and backlight is great. Charge lasts around 1 1/2 to 2  weeks using on a regular work day schedule. The keyboard is pretty quite and is responds with a decent speed.,2020,03
"Personally,  I would prefer if light stay up longer, or I can extend that some how. I know it will drain battery,  but I would just charge more often.But besides of that I LOVE IT!!!",2020,03
"New update:  Of all the damn products I have bought, I did not buy an extended warranty for this product. So I guess I am screwed..... Update Update: Not only is this keyboard is loud ad ""F"" It finally stopped working... Thank God for 4-year warranties.  Update, change the rating to 1 star:  The keys have become LOUDER over time. PLEASE don't buy this keyboard, my friends on the phone say how loud the keys are all the time now.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK...Granted they are NOT the clacky mechanic keys, but CLOSE. I guess I need membrane keys. I will try to take a 1 handed video later, but every time I hit the spacebar, HOLY CRAP.  the damn noise. It's my fault. I was getting away from paying $99 for another Logitech keyboard that only glows dim white (I like the pretty colors this one has)  BUT when you put ""silent"" in  the description, it BETTER be silent.",2020,02
"Is a amazing keyboard, for the game is a little slower.",2020,02
This keyboard is pretty cool but it doesn’t seem to hold up to my son’s gaming. We had to return it for a new one in the first month. The second one seems to be working fine with no issues. I think it is not for serious gamers. It will be fine at a desk where it doesn’t get moved a lot.,2020,02
"So far I have been loving this keyboard. I have not had any drop outs on the wireless. I would recommend for anyone causal, but serious gamers know to always go wired.",2020,02
It is muc more than what I expected.,2020,02
"Only thing I don’t like about it is that the cable included in the package is ONLY for charging, rather than for charging and wired use. You must use the wireless adapter for it to work. Not a huge deal, but it would be nice if wired use was an option, it would make sense.",2020,02
"UPDATE! Changed my review from five stars to 3 stars. It stills holds charge but the num lock keeps turning off and when I hit it it makes me push the key about four times before it turns on again and now it has a huge lag.  I have only had it a couple weeks and it is starting to take a crap. Holds a charge, I can shut it off at night and I can also plug it in my computer to charge and still use it. I love it. Super quiet keys.",2020,02
"This keyboard works well. My only complaint is the lights go off very quickly when you stop typing.  Other than that, its easy to recharge, and looks good on my desk top.",2020,02
"Amazing value, I was worried about the input delay playing games like DotA or Tarkov but there is honestly no delay. It could also be that I'm not a pro gamer by any means and I'm just not good enough to notice it. Either way 10/10.",2020,02
"Keys were really nice and slim the letter inside was also delightful it’s been 2 months and I still haven’t had to charge it, it’s great!!!",2020,02
"This turns out to be exactly what I needed. The seller is so nice, they sent little bit of extras like stickers, and a funny note to go with everything else. They also have a great customer service and are really willing to help with any issues. Great purchase!",2020,02
I love the colors and how light it feels. Product was exactly how it was described. Thank you!,2020,02
I purchased this for my son’s gaming computer. He loves it !Thank You,2020,02
Owned for 1 month and spacebar is already sticking.,2020,02
I use mine to work in the dark and having the keyboard light up is perfect so I dont wake up my husband. Its quiet which I love and its light weight.,2020,02
"Bought this around 6 months ago. The advertised range of 33 feet is just not true. I have the dongle around 7 feet away and the keyboard randomly stops registering keystrokes. I have to bring the keyboard close to the dongle for it to re register and then sit back down on the couch. This might be battery related but then there is no visual indicator of battery levels.Today though it just completely stopped working, doesnt register any keystrokes.The keyboard is very light which is nice.",2020,02
Love the colors and the look. Runs very well also.,2020,02
"I'm not a gamer; however, I do enjoy the feel of this keyboard for typing and the backlighting is very cool.",2020,02
Im very happy with the quality and the design of the keyboard. Im glad there are many features including wireless and waterproof.,2020,02
"Sometimes the keyboard will straight stop working, then all your inputs pop in all at once more than a minute later",2020,02
Great keyboard for the price,2020,02
"I got this for my son in December, it worked great until today, it keeps dying. It lasted 3 months.",2020,02
Fftttt,2020,02
"My office desk has a slide-out tray for the keyboard, and this keyboard is perfect for that because of its slim design... there is no wasted space. I had to replace a more expensive keyboard for that reason, and I actually like this one much better. The only complaint I have is that the Caps Lock key is apparently where my fingers and brain feel like the Shift key should be. Hopefully I will adjust to that.",2020,02
"This is my first wireless keyboard in life...and I LOVE IT!! The standby time is outstanding.  The battery life is superb!! I love how the keyboard lights up with different colors as well.  I have NOT experienced any LAG or disconnection of the keyboard from my PC while using it.  While in idle if a key is pressed it immediately connects without a problem.  Great product, definitely would recommend it to others!!",2020,02
"No issues, has a good battery life. Looks slick and is really light weight.",2020,02
"It's really nice, bright, soft key sound, works while charging....super happy",2020,02
"I bought this for the office to have as something different, I love that the keyboard and mouse are rechargable, totally what sold me on it but would be nice the lights would stay on longer before timing out and if there were more options for the light.......like maybe blinking or running back and forth or even blink multi color or even different solid colors to pick from along with the different light options (blink, flash, fade, etc..)..... other than that overall a good product.... thank you",2020,02
Bought this for my son and he loves it.,2020,02
The keyboard is great I just don't like that the RGB lights turn off every 60 seconds,2020,02
I love it so nice will tell friends. I even texted the computer tech who recommended it to me. AWESOME,2020,02
"Wish the colors were customizable, other than that it looks and performs well!",2020,02
light weight- no lag- great value,2020,02
im typing on my broken keyboard  the one this pile was supposed to replace,2020,02
Gift for son. Thanks.,2020,02
Liked illumation,2020,02
Not the greatest but works,2020,02
This keyboard met all my expectations.,2020,02
"I think everything else was good about this, it's just that my charger broke really quick and I now do not have charger for this. It is hard to find a charger for this product. I would make charger stronger because it is really inconvenient for the user. I would recommend if charger was built with durability.",2020,02
"Amazing keyboard, good feel, great look",2020,02
"This KLIM Chroma Rechargeable Wireless Gaming Keyboard + Slim, Durable, Ergonomic, Quiet, Waterproof, Silent Keys + Backlit Wireless Keyboard for PC PS4 Xbox One Mac + Teclado Gamer + New 2020 Version is a quality keyboard.  I love the back-lights on it.  Very easy to type on and works perfectly.  I like it very much and am pleased with this purchase",2020,02
I ordered to use in my office at work. It’s not too loud and I love the lights.,2020,02
I ordered one as a gift and the first one I received did not work. However the second one I ordered that was then gifted also worked perfect,2020,02
"Overall I love the build and the color and feel of the keyboard but I do not like the style of the enter key. Instead of a tall enter key, it would be better and more comfortable to have the long enter key (like most standard keys)",2020,02
This keyboard lives up to everything that is promised in its description. Would recommend!,2020,02
Great product and great value,2020,02
The keyboard works great!  The backlighting is perfect and I can see the keys in the dark fine.  Perfect for my needs.  Thank you!,2020,02
"I got this keyboard to use for streaming, as I frequently need to move my keyboard depending on if I'm gaming or using my desk space for my stream. So far I really like it! The keys have good resistance, but are not overly noisy. The color on it is great and not distracting. My only small complaint with the keyboard having the backslash key next to the enter key, as I'll frequently be trying to hit enter and hit that key instead because of the odd shape of the key. But other than that I have been very impressed with this keyboard, especially at the price point!",2020,02
"This is EXACTLY the keyboard I was looking for. Soft keys press easily, wireless and the rainbow lights are a bonus. I got thro keyboards about every 2 years. Next time, I will not have search for what I want because I will definitely be buying this one again. They do not last forever and now that I know exactly what works the best for me, I will go to this keyboard again and again, for all future purchases. I saw alot of other cool stuff on their site, so will be picking up a few more items from KLIM soon.",2020,02
"I love this keyboard so much. High quality performance, excellent response, looks amazing with my gaming rig.",2020,02
I bought this product for the lighted keyboard and when I recieved it I was impressed on how much I like it. The sleep feature is very good. Exactly what I was needing I use it alot at night and don't need extra lights turned on now.,2020,02
"3 stars because like others experienced, Left CTRL+SHIFT does not register with all keys. Guessing they didn't map all of those or something. Alternative I use is Left CTRL Right SHIFT. If you don't use this key combo often then this is a fantastic product.",2020,02
"I've been using this keyboard for about three months, and I've only had to charge it about twice, using it about 3+ hours a day. It's definitely not the best ""gaming"" keyboard, but for the price I would say a good buy.",2020,02
Great product,2020,02
"Keyboard is directly as advertised. It responds fast with no lag. The ability to change some of features using FN is just an added bonus. Keys are very comfortable, I honestly, like gaming on it better than the expensive gaming keyboards. Works very well for me.",2020,02
It is lite-weight works well so far.  But I only have it for a week.I will post back in a month..  I have been using it for about 6 weeks. I need to charge it every 10-12 days.  That is a bit faster then I would like.  The reason I dropped this from five stars to fours stars is it dies boom good then bad when it needs the charge. I don't like to be surprised by a working keyboard then a dead one without a warning.  When it works I like it I like the feel and find it nice for blogging.  But I could be writing here.  Then dead almost instantly.  This means I have to keep track of when to charge it.  I have to work a bit extra to not get caught off guard .  I will come back and review it in six months.I hope the battery keeps taking a charge. i am thinking this was not my best choice I use it 3-4 hours a day. Not typing constantly but still hitting the keys fairly often. It is lit night to day and the charge runs down fairly quickly.  I wish it had a larger battery.  My fear is it will not take a charge after six months use.If you are going to type a lot and constantly don't buy this.,2020,02
I purchased two different keyboards and after trying both this one won hands down.  It is so comfortable to use and stunning to look at.  I use it for every day use and it’s perfect.  I highly recommend it.  Every time I sit down to use my computer when I hit that space bar I smile. It’s really cool.,2020,01
"Keyboard is great, functions as promised. The follow-up email was truly helpful as many of us do not read the instructions, the key instructions were in the email and made the keyboard even more functional.One improvement that i feel would be nice: being able to change the color of the lighting mainly to all one color.",2020,01
"Awesome product was carefully retrieved from our inventory with sterilized anti-bacterial gloves and placed on a satin silk cushion. A team of 50 experts then proceeded to inspect your product, they polished it until it shone bright and bid it farewell with a tender caress … then delivered quickly using two Euro Fighter to escort and insure its safe arrival. Upon inspection, I understood why KLIM took so much care and pride to provide this kool gaming keyboard. Have enjoyed using it right out of the box without any problems. KLIM offered me email support to answer any question about using their product. My only question is, How did they managed to evade our F22s. Thanks! PaulTip: The KLIM Chroma Wireless has 3 light modes: breathing, constant and off. You can change it by pressing ""FN + Pause Break"". You can also increase the luminosity by pressing ""FN + Page Up"" and decrease it with ""FN + Page Down""!",2020,01
This keyboard is great. I needed a keyboard that was wireless and backlight. I am not far from my laptop so I cannot comment on the orange. But I am extremely happy with my purchase. I would buy it again if I need one for my other computer.,2020,01
Works awesome! Haven't had to charge it for a couple weeks now!,2020,01
My granddaughter loves this for her gaming system,2020,01
It’s very quit and very smooth for gaming. Also like the different lighting when using the keyboard.,2020,01
Son loves it!,2020,01
"I just received this is the last week or so and it is exactly what i expected. I turned it on, it lights up, keys are responsive and it even goes to sleep which i really like. Customer service reached out with a generic email. Hope you got it, if not let us know, leave a review, all that. They also gave information about making the lights brighter and dimmer, and the different settings. very nice.",2020,01
Purchased for an external keyboard for a laptop. Colors are vibrant.,2020,01
I dont use for gaming. Bought for work and is absolutely everything I wanted. Holds charge for weeks. Colors are noticeable. Keys are not loud and response time is immediate.,2020,01
"I really like this keyboard and so far it lives up to all of my expectations.  I didn't but it for gaming, but rather to replace a work keyboard that I hated to type on.  I enjoy the lighted colors, the numeric keypad and the easy set up with a little dongle to plug in and you're ready to go.  I also believe that customer service moving forward will be very good.",2020,01
"I like everything about it except the CTRL+ commands seem to go haywire on my Macbook! The Ctrl, Windows, and Alt buttons all sometimes seem to function in the same way, but it's not consistent. One works to copy, another works to paste. It is unfortunate, because I like the look and feel of it, but I just can't get much work done using it.",2020,01
Awesome keyboard. Perfect for late night design work in the dark.,2020,01
This is perfect for gaming!,2020,01
Son loves it,2020,01
Ohhhhhh! I love this keyboard in every way!!! I don’t game but I do work at night and I can see all the keys:),2020,01
Forgot it was wireless. Was even more extactic to get it,2020,01
"Garbage! Returning it. Volumn keys do not work. Light is underneath the keys and do not light up the letters, numbers, and symbols. Printing on keys are too small and unreadable unless you have very young eyes. Returning it!",2020,01
I love this it stays charged for weeks,2020,01
"I got this because I love playing different games ranging from first-person shooters to indie singleplayer story games. It works for everything, if it does happen to run out of battery then you can easily plug it in and keep doing whatever you like!",2019,12
"I was really interested in this because it markets itself as ""quiet"". And let me tell you, if I never needed to use the space bar, it would be very, very quiet. However, as most modern languages call for spaces between words, this keyboard is incredibly loud. If you so much as LOOK at the space bar, it clacks. It's probably the only thing you can hear from my desk as every other key is so silent. The space bar RUINS the rest of the key board. No connectivity issues, the time out is fine, battery is fine, keys work great. But gosh DARN is it loud. I don't know if it's going to stop bothering me at some point, I'm trying to give it time, but I may have to just scrap this keyboard and try a different brand. I'd say spend your money elsewhere as this is beyond annoying.",2020,01
"I purchased this keyboard for use with my gaming machine, using it upon my lap in a chair with arm rests. It doesn't fit within the boundaries of the arm rests which causes me to be partially rotated to the left to even try and use it. Wish the keys were more centrally located for my back's sake!Great backlight which dealuminates after use. Keys are a bit clunky, an overreach for that satisfying tactile response producing labored finger extension while using.  Wish they would send me one without the number pad as not to interrupt the use of my main machine, which I use hours every day!",2020,01
Awesome keyboard for gaming at this price,2020,01
"Have had this key board for about a month now and only had to charge it one time after the initial charge while having the pulsing effect on.  Although I do not type long messages out like this all day long, I do use the key board pretty frequently. Switches feel extremely smooth as well. Will update again for its use in the long term.",2020,01
"This keyboard is awesome! Does not require batteries as it is a rechargeable keyboard which is cool. Came with the usb c cord. So awesome. Lighting is great and I really like the size of it, great buy! ;)",2020,01
My son loves it!!,2020,01
micro usb would'nt connect or the keyboard never worked in the first place. figured for near 40$ said and done that it would be a reliable product... i was wrong.,2020,01
"I've never had to charge it for the few weeks i used it. The lights cant change i dont think, but it doesnt matter to me. The wireless range is good enough as well, keys feel nice. It sleeps when idle, and i find the wakeup very responsive. i havent had any issues with this. Havent really used the various function keys, and never gamed with it (i use controller anyway) but for what i do it works perfectly.",2020,01
For computer use into the evening hours...very nice and functional to have a lighted keyboard.,2020,01
"Had it for a week and it was great until it started just randomly inputting keys and became unusable, DO NOT BUY.",2020,01
"Some standard hotkeys don't work with the left shift button. I'm disappointed, but I want to like this keyboard. The company refunded me, then I ordered another one cause it's a neat keyboard and I'd hoped the problem was a fluke--nope, same problem on the second one.Specifically, Ctrl + LEFT shift + any of the following: P, O, I, U, Y, H, N, M, do not work on this keyboard. If you normally use ctrl + RIGHT shift + any key, I suppose you won't notice a problem. But for me I first noticed it trying to select inverse in photoshop (ctrl+shift+i), and found the other problems using a keyboard ghosting tool.Aside from that problem I like this keyboard, but it really touts ""anti-ghosting"" stuff so I did not expect this kind of problem. It might not seem like a big deal but it's easier for me to just use a different keyboard than re-learn decades old muscle memory, and who knows what other key combinations are faulty.",2020,01
That is perfect~ Thank You:),2020,01
"I purchased this item because of the backlighting. I planned to use it in our living room at night to interact with our TV. The backlighting is great. I like the feel of the keyboard.But yesterday I connected it to my desktop.  I was having problems when I would hit the return key with my left pinky. After comparing the KLIM with the worn out Logitech I am replacing, I found that there is an extra key between the quotation mark key and the Enter key! The backslash key has been moved down a row!If I were a hunt and peck typist, I suppose this would be fine. But I learned to touch type 55 years ago.  I use my touch typing skills many times a day. Why would I want to teach myself how to find the Enter key all over again?! To press a key, thinking that I am using the Enter key and then finding that I have a backslash, or that the item failed to load is maddening.I dislike giving a low score to such a good looking keyboard. But if buyers have the same concern as I do, they need to know what they are buying.I would also prefer a larger delete key.",2020,01
"This was a great buy, but reason I gave it 3 stars is it doesn't have a very long range to operate in. You can only go about 6 feet before you lose connection.",2020,01
There isn't anything that I don't like about. I like it very much.,2020,01
If your buy it to play in the dark like I did it is worthless. I put it back in the box. I use a steering wheel and button box so I don't use key Keyboard all the time but when I need to I have to turn a light on to see what key to hit. I'd send it back if I could and get one that stays lit until I turn it off. Useless to me  for playing in the dark.,2020,01
"This is rechargable and therefore not wireless. It must be plugged in to a wire in order to recharge. This is a huge pain to have to deal with connecting it and tripping over wires, etc, for hours while it recharges, compared to just swapping out some AA batteries in a few seconds.",2020,01
The keyboard stopped recharging after using up the battery twice.,2020,01
"My laptop doesn't have light up keys, and I prop it higher so I don't put strain on my neck. This wireless laptop came at a great price and is made in America.",2020,01
"Nice looking, light weight keyboard. Happy with the purchase.",2020,01
"This is a regular keyboard, light weight. Works ok. NOT good for gaming, it drops signal, signal is intermittent and/or keyboard light turns off quickly.",2019,12
"Update: after about 3 weeks of use, it just completely stopped working. I've been using it plugged into the computer via the charger because the wireless connection is so inconsistent. But today when I got home from work, it's just not working. Didn't get it wet, didn't drop it, etc, can't think of any reason for it to just randomly stop working, but it did. Wireless or plugged in, the keyboard still lights up with the rainbow color, but doesn't acknowledge any key strokes, caps and num lock don't light up, and my computer just keeps saying ""device not responding"" when I try to manually connect it. Don't throw your money away, buy a functional keyboard from a reputable brand, not some shoddy Chinese company with positive review bots.Original: This keyboard has some sort of timer so it will turn off when it's not used. It's about 10 seconds when it's plugged in (it comes with a ridiculously short USB cable, maybe 2 feet long), and 3 seconds or so when being used wirelessly. When it automatically turns off, it takes anywhere from 2-15 seconds to turn back on and reconnect to Bluetooth before it starts registering keystrokes again. It's a constant annoyance that makes most games frustratingly unplayable, and I can't figure out any way to disable it. I really can't recommend this to anybody, it truly makes games unplayable, and any other computer activity annoying and frustrating with a lot of wasted time waiting for it to reconnect. I'm gonna have to return this garbage and get a new wireless keyboard.",2020,01
Great keyboard. Highly recommend.,2020,01
My granddaughter loves this keyboard. She’s 12 and isn’t a gamer so it’s perfect for her.,2020,01
This product offers soft touch keys. Which is something I look for in a keyboard. I don't want it to sound like I am using a typewriter when I am on the computer.,2020,01
Wish it notified you of low power/battery.  Instead it just dies with no warning.,2020,01
This keyboard works great for my needs.  Good battery life and goes to sleep right away.  Even types the first key when you wake it up.  I do not game thats why I only gave it a three.,2020,01
Great product. Great customer service. Great battery life. It's a cool and amazing keyboard,2019,12
Works great for gaming in low light.,2019,12
This was a gift for my daughter. She loves it but she doesn't really use it for gaming.,2019,12
Redddr,2019,12
Got itand time and my grandson loves it,2019,12
"This keyboard is so awesome, I will buy another when necessary. We have a projector connected to our computer and this keyboard helps when trying to watch movies in the dark.",2019,12
"Wanted a keyboard with a backlit I could use at night when doing work. Got it at the end of November 2019 and as of January 10, 20 it no longer works.  Wouldn't buy it again. Waste of $30.00.",2019,12
"My son LOVES THIS. HE was so happy Christmas morning. Works great , worth the money , recommend buying it.",2019,12
Easy to install and use.,2019,12
"Got this gift for my husband, cause I was tired of tripping over the cords. I personally love the fact I don't have to trip, and hubby is happy as well.",2019,12
For some reason I thought this took batteries but it doesnt. It has an on board battery that takes USB-c to charge. No big deal I have a note 9 and keep a charger at my desk. I got it because its waterproof and I work in a bar. Accidents happen. Haven't used that feature yet but I'll update if I do. Battery life is good. Lights look cool but you can turn them off if you want. I'd buy again.,2019,12
My son loves it! Hooked up to Xbox easily. Works great!,2019,12
"I like. It good. It shine.Keyboard functions reliably and has a long battery life. I like that it auto sleeps to save on battery. It's especially beautiful too. There is some latency, but it's not noticeable when playing games like The Sims 4 or Planet Zoo.",2019,12
The keyboard looks and works great.,2019,12
This keyboard is deceptive! It's really pretty and feels good to use but in about 3 months of use it started having response issues. I use it for gaming and it would randomly stop responding or lag for a few seconds to minutes before recovering. It does this regardless of charger status and even when plugged in. I used it directly next to the receiver and on different machines so it isn't the Bluetooth on my end or distance affecting it. I think either the keys lose responsivity or the Bluetooth signal is losing connection.,2019,12
"I love the back lighting,rechargeable battery and light. I personally only sit at a desk when playing games.I mostly like wireless so i don't have to sit at a flat surface for the keyboard use. I like to sit back from my computer on 42 inch monitor TV for emails,you tube videos and browsing the internet while holding the keyboard only when changing websites. Your design makes that harder to pick up or hold with the left hand and typing with the right.The keys go to the very edge of the unit only the bottom and right top corner have a spot to use a thumb to hold without touching a key a little more area on right side would be ideal for many users comfort when holding the board especially near the Esc key,an another model perhaps flared out going to the top..",2019,12
So far my husband is loving it. I would prefer a non colored mode.,2019,12
Works great,2019,12
"This is the best wireless keyboard I’ve ever bought. I know ppl complain about slow response of the keyboard, but if you change the settings for it, you’ll get better results!!! My boys play games on my laptop and this keyboard responds quickly to all the commands required to play the games!!!Amazing keyboard for an affordable price! Love the colors!!! Love the fact you can change the intensity of the glow!!",2019,12
It's not mine but my son got it for Christmas and he really likes it over the xbox controller.,2019,12
"I have been using this keyboard for about 3 or 4 days now and so far it works really well for it's intended purpose. I love the way that the keys feel and that the lights look when I am typing. That being said, there are a few things that knocked this keyboard down to only 4 stars. The first is that while the keyboard is advertised as being silent, this is not the case. In fact, I have found that some of the keys that are more commonly used such as the ENTER key or the spacebar are actually louder than the rest of the keys. For me this hasn't been a huge deal, but I can see how people would be upset if they bought it with the intention of having a quiet keyboard. The second thing is that the LED lights are not as bright as I would have wanted. In the dark, they stand out perfectly and look amazing. However, in daytime or brighter lighting, the lights are hard to see and draw away from the overall aesthetic of the keyboard.",2019,12
It’s fast and comfortable to use,2019,12
Battery life is great great beginner keyboard,2019,12
Nice keyboard at this price just make sure your computer is Bluetooth compatible for wireless operation.,2019,12
Easy to use.  Great to go wireless.,2019,12
I have been using this keyboard for almost 2 and a half months and at first I issues with finding the on/off switch for turning on wireless and had to have both plugged into my computer for wireless and charging. After I found the switch on the back it made everything easier and more convenient. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good wireless keyboard with a long battery life.,2019,12
"2 big design problems: 1) the lights don't stay on, probably to conserve the battery. This means if you are not using the keyboard for a few seconds, say you are just using the mouse, or just reading the screen, the keys go dark. Then you can't see whatever key you need to hit first when you are ready. 2) The Enter key is one key farther to the right than a standard keyboard. As a life-long touch-typist, I now am tying ""\"" when I mean to hit enter. So not only did I not gain the ability to see the keys in the dark, but I lost the expected location of the enter key.Just a couple of points of clarification: 1) you cannot change the colors. You can just adjust the brightness of the backlighting, and you can put it on some weird ""breath"" setting where it slowly goes brigher and darker. 2) This does not take ""batteries"" like most wireless keyboards. It actually requires a wire to charge the built-in battery, which is billed as taking 4 hours to charge for 17 hours of usage. Might as well leave it connected. So much for ""wireless"".",2019,12
"Grandson loves it, it is awesome love the colors , not to bright.",2019,12
Works great. Great value for the money.,2019,12
"I got this as a gift for my husband for Christmas and couldn't be happier for $30. This has a good set of lights and it comes with a built in battery that charges via usb. My husband loves it and at $30, it was a steal and I'm a customer for life now. The only minor thing about this is that it sleeps a little too fast, but any key waking it up, makes that almost null.",2019,12
"This was purchased for a PC that occasionally gets used for gaming but nothing intensive.  On the like side is the backlit keys which are multi colored and bright and readable when all other lights are out in the room.  Something I have struggled to find in other purchased keyboards.  Second is the sleep mode which immediately responds when a key is depressed bringing the keyboard back to life and recording the initial keystroke to the screen.  I have a Mid-high Corsair that cannot do that at 4 times the price tag.  And battery life is way longer than the more expensive Corsair.  My only dislike is the change the manufacturer made in the ENTER/RETURN key.  All of my other keyboards without exception have a horizontal return key.  This one has moved the  key with the forward slash mark ( \ ) to the row next to the quotation marks key allowing the return key to be vertical rather than horizontal.  For a touch key typist, this creates a problem since the pinky finger now has an additional full key width space to cross to get the return key it did not have with other keyboards.  For gamers this is an acceptable, inexpensive keyboard and well worth the money.  For a touch typist, you might want to pick something else as the change in the return key is very frustrating.  This is an update from original initial review. Device did not last a year and stopped working altogether. As did the expensive corsair.  I have gone back to a good WIRED keyboard.",2019,12
Where’s the ‘V’??????,2019,12
It was pretty good,2019,12
"When buying gaming gear, you got to look at the price. For this pricepoint, this keyboard is easily 5 stars. Responsive, great for typing, battery lasts for days. Gaming on a budget? Definitely worth it.Only con is the layout of the enter key but once you get used to it it's fine.",2019,12
There is a delay when typing.,2019,12
"Great keyboard for the price. Really like the feel of the keys. Not used to the enter key yet having a notch out where the \ key is, but not a big deal. Also wish it had dedicated volume keys as well as opposed to pressing the FN key first.",2019,12
"It's very light, very quiet. Installed right away. Works perfect on Win7 64. Lights are bright enough but not too bright. Looks and works exactly as described.",2019,12
Love the cordlessmess!! Best I've seen! Thanks,2019,12
This is an absolutely awesome keyboard! It's wireless and doesn't run on batteries and is chargeable through USBC. Hubby is using it for PS4 gaming if that helps anyone. 😀👍,2019,12

"Pretty colors, but some of the keys are off and in a weird location. Kept hitting the wrong key. Returned right away.",2019,12
"I was getting sick of my clickity clackity keyboard so I went with this. I don't game a lot on it but haven't noticed any input delay while playing FPS. My only gripe is the sleep mode is annoying because you can't see the keyboard at all when it turns off. I'm sure you can change it up just haven't bothered looking into it yet. Lightweight and sleek, a keeper for sure.",2019,12
I thought it was battery operated but I didn't read the description well enough. It lasts about 3 days between charges.  At least I can see the keyboard without the lights on. I'm happy with it.,2019,12
"Really don’t care for this product. It seems to constantly be acting up. For example, I was just trying to type an address and all my numbers appeared as if I had been holding the shift key (#%^*).",2019,12
Great keyboard very responsive keys,2019,12
"If you're a touch typist, expect to be slowed down and make a lot of mistakes, because the Enter key is much further to the right than any other keyboard I've ever used.  Because of this, this keyboard is very uncomfortable to use.The keys resist a bit, but bounce back slowly.  It's very easy for a fast typist to get letters out of order, because they keyboard just isn't responsive enough.I don't see how anyone would accept this as a gaming keyboard.",2019,12
Solid wireless keyboard and the best bang for your buck. Very mobile and responsive. Crispy-boy spill-proof.,2019,12
Its a great item except battery doesn’t last too long,2019,11
I’ve used it for about a week. Everything was good but the Bluetooth connections keep going on and off. Very annoying...[update]Feb. 19the keyboard is completely dead now.no connection at all and no light at all.no customer service.,2019,11
"I bought this to replace my regular keyboard with no backlit.  This works well.  The only problem is the charging cable is too short.  I will need to use another cable.  Otherwise, it does what it's supposed to.",2019,11
Eyvr oogd,2019,11
Very nice keyboard for the price. I like the angle it’s not to steep so you it’s comfortable on your wrist for extended typing. The keys have a nice feel to them as you type.The backlights help while typing in the evening.It’s a pretty nice keyboard for maybe someone starting to build a gaming PC setup.At the current price I think you get good value.The charging cable could be a bit longer but the battery has lasted a good amount of time so I haven’t had the need to charge it too often yet.,2019,11
Love it! As expected.,2019,11
Great product,2019,11
very nice colors.beautiful and quality,2019,11
"So far so good. Was suppose to be a Christmas present for my son, however it came boxed with a 40 lb bag of dog food and keyboard box was smashed. Also, the seal was cut open, so I had to have my son make sure everything worked. Not much of a present surprise, but at least it works, so far.",2019,11
Good product,2019,11
"This is a great product for a cheap price.It is light weight. The rechargeable battery keeps a charge very well, only have to charge it a couple times a week and you can use it while it is charging.I sit about 8 feet away from my PC tower or Xbox and I have no issues with it not responding.This is also a very nice looking product and looks exactly how the picture shows.I will buy this product in the future if I need another one.This also works for my Xbox One X which is awesome.",2019,11
"I love these keyboard, everything about it except the ""Enter"" and ""|\"" keys.The layout is different from any of the previous keyboards I've owned and the one that's on my laptop.If I don't get used to the layout in due time, I'll be returning it. It's pretty dumb.",2019,11
"Overall, this keyboard is good. Connects fine, lighting is pretty cool, keys are comfortable. Very very light and doesn't take up too much space on the desk. However, it doesn't remain charged at all. Even after left plugged in overnight, the keyboard dies after being unplugged. It still works okay, but the battery life is extremely disappointing.",2019,11
Love it,2019,11
"The KLIM is extremely quiet which is the number one thing that is important to me. Battery life is great, plus it is rechargeable. My only complaint is the connection. I would rate it about 4/5 due to it sometimes randomly losing connection. After two months my S key is starting to rub off. Back light to the keyboard is perfect in my opinion. Price for the keyboard is really good. Think this keyboard will last about a year for me. Overall great keyboard I love it.",2019,11
"Well, I am not a gamer but I am a coder and I was looking for a good keyboard. I tried variety of them but this one is the best. Its ideal for typing and the light does not pinch you eyes in the dark.It has the option to adjust the brightness level and you change the colors according to your need.All in all I love it and would recommend it.",2019,11
It already does not work.Had to buy another keyboard.Color not very bright..,2019,11
"Less than 2 months after receiving my keyboard, it stopped working. The on-off switch on the back of the keyboard seems to have something to do with the problem. The keyboard stopped working a couple of weeks after the 'return window' closed, so I was referred to KLIM directly. Long story short, KLIM never resolved the issue, despite the fact that this product has a warranty. I sent about 4 emails before giving up. I would definitely not recommend the product. When I purchased the keyboard, I was excited about the features described, but if the product doesn't function, then those features are useless. Note: I didn't have any problems with the Amazon seller.",2019,11
"I liked the feel and positive sensitivity of the keys, unfortunately it just wasn't bright enough for me to see the lettering.",2019,11
Looks good so far,2019,11
I absolutely love it because it’s so beautiful! Thank you for the fast shipping!,2019,11
Love the feel of the keys and the keyboard is light without feeling cheap. And the backlight is great and even better that you can change the brightness so it is great to use at night.,2019,11
"I don't use this keyboard for game, but I type a lot, I like it being very quiet when I type and the LED light is pretty when it's on. I bought one of this keyboard couple months ago for work, I like it so much, then I bought another one for my home computer. Not expensive but good quality product.",2019,11
Excellent purchase...provides great back lighting for typing in low or no light situations. Great feel to the keys and excellent range. I have been using for 10 days now on the initial charge and am very happy with the power capacity so far. Highly recommend.,2019,11
"LoveD this keyboard and it had  been working great until last week. Numerous keys stopped working . I have done everything I can think of to fix it, but nothing works? Too bad because this was a nice keyboard.",2019,11
This works great and is very quiet. I also like the lighting options.,2019,11
"I'm not a gamer,.. but i love this keyboard.. in fact it's so nice I bought a 2nd one for work..very cool looking and key strokes feel very comfortable.. highly recommended !",2019,11
"Enter key was difficult to reach, I'm going off size, bit of a stretch.",2019,11
The keyboard works as it should for a regular keyboard - maybe I’m just picky for gaming items - they need to be quick and smooth. This is not; it works well for regular typing,2019,11
"I had high hopes for this, but unfortunently out of the box is disconnects constantly, which makes it unusable for gaming. it happens both unplugged and plugged in, very disappointing poorly made product.",2019,11
I really like this wireless light up keyboard I have been searching for 1 for awhile and I'm glad I decided on this 1.,2019,11
Gaming,2019,11
Love it. Use it for work in darker room.,2019,11
"Update: reorganized the living room and it seems that the wireless signal improved a lot. Corners seem problematic for the dongle.With a good direct line of sight it works well.-I really like the look and the fact that the enter key is large (ISO layout) the key between Z and left shift is missing tho. Not sure whether it should be there anyway.Packing is nice and adds emotional value :) . The USB charging cable is a little too short.The bad news is, if it is not close enough to the dongle it fails a lot.After it goes to sleep it sometimes wakes up unresponsive, you get key double presses and lost keystrokes randomly. Copying pasting and cutting can be a chore because you don't know if the keyboard sent the Ctrl+x or Ctrl+v appropriately.If you figure out how to keep a steady 2.4g link between the keyboard and transmitter you're all good.I wish there was a way to know how much battery is left.If you're ok spending more on a keyboard, go for the pro stuff. If you're on a budget it's a good pick.P.s. Dear Klim guys, I like you. Try improving connectivity for solid reliable wireless performance and showing battery usage",2019,11
works wonderful!,2019,10
"Everything is good but the keys would look better with light color light. It means, on the left side, blue & purple mixes up with black color of the keyboard & makes the contrast less appealing. It works great on the right side though with green & light blue. There is no yellow though. That would be better.",2019,10
"Love it!!! Makes work so much easier, the key board is flawless! Super happy but do wish there would be a way to make the back lot brighter.",2019,10
"Works great, It's not very sturdy or high quality but you get what you pay for, Also within a minute  (not sure how much time exactly) the lights won't stay on, it'll dim on you which i don't like. You can change the settings  to have slow blink or solid blink but it will turn dark after so many seconds which i'm not a big fan of.",2019,10
"For the price maybe is an option, but first i received a keyboard broken, i send it back and they sent me a replacement, but after 1 week of use this bs stopped working, so bad quality material too,I just bought a 80 dollar keyboard, cheap sh*t like this just will last for 1 month or less.",2019,10
Cant believe the quality for the price! I highly recommend this to anyone building either a new office set up or gaming set up.,2019,10
I love this keyboard! I work in a large office from 8-5 typing all day so I needed something comfortable and quiet. This has been working perfect for me and would defiantly recommend!,2019,10
The keys would do the wrong function and it was missing several options.,2019,10
Got my computer hooked up to the tv so its nice to have this on the nightstand and it light up at night.,2019,10
"I'm updating this review. I received a keyboard that stopped charging a month after I bought it. I contacted the company, and their customer service was amazing and they sent me a new one quickly.  So far my new one works great, which I'm so happy about because I really enjoy this keyboard.",2019,10
"Nice, light, cool. Not brightness expected but decent price, 4/5 stars",2019,10
Very silent,2019,10
Great little board but they need to alter the LED Settings. Mainly the thing needs to not fall asleep on me in the dark cuz its getting old.,2019,10
"Haven't even used it yet...and won't.  Keys are all very loose and extremely cheap feeling, but for the price it was kind of expected.  The most disappointing thing about the purchase is the way it was shipped.  I ordered multiple products including a few heavy tv mounts which were, of course, on top of the keyboard and my led lights.  UPS was upset about the weight of the box and told me not to ship heavy items because they will be broken when they arrive.  If you must order this keyboard make sure you don't order anything else at the same time.",2019,10
"Easy to use. Wonderful look and feel. I feel that it could be a bit brighter. The company answered and solved my problem with in an hour. The problem was my mistake but, they helped me out anyways.",2019,09
Works great and connects instantly. I wish the lights were a bit brighter and had an option to let them stay on. They turn off after 1 minute or so. I've had this for 3 months now and some of the buttons stopped working. Maybe I have a faulty one. But prior to this it was doing it's job. Great for price but it is cheap.,2019,10
"I was kinda disappointed with this keyboard. On one hand, it's a great and affordable wireless keypad. It feels a bit cheap but it serves its purpose. I thought it was ""backlit"" but it's not really, hence the 4 star review. Not sure if it's me or the description of the product but I was really disappointed in this regard. Overall though, it's a good little wireless keyboard. Not great if what you're looking for is a keyboard to use in dim lighting though. Even on the best setting, it seems to go dim over a very short period of time.",2019,10
A little disappointed with the brightness and the fact that it sleeps immediately after use,2019,10
"This is really good bang for your buck, you are getting what your paying for then more. The keys are a little ristricting for complex games (crafting, survival, inventory, management) but for FPS and others it is really great. Even with those more complex games it works. When I use it and hour or two a day, it last for about 5 days, I don't even turn the power switch off, it sleeps really efficiently. Over all a well rounded keyboard.",2019,10
Awesome for many reasons! backlit for dark living room at night!! no batteries (rechargable!!!) and comfortable keys. 5 stars!!!,2019,10
I love the feel and look of this keyboard but it randomly stops working and the key strokes aren't transferred to the computer. very frustrating.,2019,10
It’s just an all around good keyboard.I’m not computer whiz but everything I need is easily found. I like the background lighting which makes finding keys like “Volume Up” easy to do in the dark.,2019,10
"I ha giving reveiws, bu errible producfor gaming mulible kes ha nvr worked. ried o ignor, bu from m msg u can see alo of kes don work. his looks lijke gibbersih because i doesn work",2019,10
I had issue with the keyboard but received the replacement so fast with quick response. Really good quality for this price so you can have better keyboard with higher pricing but may not satisfy your pricing range.,2019,10
I love that its wireless and it has backlight so I can use it at  night without turning on a light.,2019,10
Great keyboard.  Works as advertised.,2019,10
"this keyboard is ass, dont buy it please. So many typos from bad connectivity, less than a month in and it cant even hold a charge now. Complete waste of money. If we humor it not breaking so quickly, the auto off feature of 30 seconds of inactivity i horrible and cant be disabled. This is a bad product in a LOT of ways",2019,10
Amazing keyboard,2019,10
I like itū,2019,10
"I really wanted to like this keyboard. I still do sort of LOL The thin form factor, lighting and silent keys are really great. I loved typing on it. However, after about 1 week of light use, and 3 weeks of moderate use for work, I had to stop using it.It would miss key strokes, double them up or triple them, keys would lag behind. It was agonizing to use. The battery seemed ok. Was going to buy the wired version but I think I'll just move on.",2019,10
Great keyboard. The lights are bright and change colors. The keys are raised and nit flat which the I didn't see in the description that they were. But its still awesome. Installed right away wireless no issues. Would buy again,2019,10
BASICMISLEADING.  Nothing special.  ...  random USish logo  ...Offensive marketing per far too often.........,2019,10
Very light and sturdy keyboard that has some cool rainbow key lights. The lights do this cool fade in and fade out effect.,2019,10
I like the design of this keyboard. The only question i have is why do I have to keep it plugged in to keep it charged?,2019,10
"Ok so I gave a 1-star for gaming because I do not know if this is a good keyboard for gaming. I just use it as a regular keyboard for my Mac Book Pro. My friend has one he uses for gaming and loves it. The reason why I bought this for regular usage was because I went to my friends room to print out some documents and used this keyboard. It felt great, looked cool and was super comfortable to use.. Plus I liked the backlit lights of course. So.. This is my reasoning for buying it and it did not disappoint. I have used it for a few weeks now, love it and will stick to this brand and style of keyboard from now on.",2019,10
This keyboard is great! I'd you want a wireless keyboard ranging from gaming to office work this is the one for you.The only downside I can think of is it's not bluetooth but other than that ita fantastic!!Now stop thinking about getting it and just get it.,2019,10
"I bought this keyboard so I could see the keys as I write in the evening and at night. This lightweight, soft keys, keyboard has great backlighting with multiple colors that flash the light gently in the background as you type.  When the keys are not in use, the backlighting turns black (off), therefore, sparing the user the time it would need to charge it. There is also an on/off button that is optional, as well.  I am able to use this keyboard swiftly, and quietly with no problem.",2019,10
Decent Product and great value for the price. Sightly recommend.,2019,09
Amazing product at a reasonable price. I would recommend. 10/10,2019,09
"lightweight, easy to hook up, and being able to adjust the backlight makes it perfect for me.",2019,09
Good value for a wireless keyboard,2019,09
Works great,2019,09
"I wish the wireless keyboards lights could stay on at all times and that the lights could be customized, but other than that I'm very pleased.",2019,09
I actually use this at work and the keyboard dims and brightens which is a little odd but not a deal breaker. Excellent little keyboard and fast shipping,2019,09
"For me this keyboard is perfect.  I am not a hardcore gamer so those that are mihht have a different opinion but for the gaming i do it works amazingly.  The keyboard charge lasts a long time. The lighting is good, not to bright but lights up all the keys beautifully. Love the keyboard!",2019,09

"Love this keyboard. Bought it to use with my PS4 and it works great. The colors are great, and I like that it shuts itself off to conserve battery. Would definitely recommend.",2019,09

Work great. Worth every penny,2019,09
meh it was ok it broke when I threw it,2019,09
"I bought this for a gift. When I looked at it, I decided to buy one for myself. I love that it is rechargable and a USB cable is included. Great tech style.",2019,09
"It's an excellent keyboard, the keys have a great texture with very sense of comfort. The layout is EU (enter key) so you'll uncomfortable until you get used it for a while, especially if you are using USA layout keyboard during the day.",2019,09
"I love this keyboard. The keys are super quiet and it’s comfortable to type on. It’s great having the colors as opposed to a simple white backlight. I only have two issues. First, I do with the colors were a tad bit brighter. Second, I would like a way, say a downloadable software, to control the brightness as well as how fast the colors fade, or not at all even, and lastly how long before sleep mode kicks in. For the price though you definitely can’t complain, and frankly I feel my issues are very minor.",2019,09
"Horrible. The first keyboard that I got had a dysfunctional key. They did do a good job of replacing it. However, the battery ran out and then the charger didn't work. As it happened, UPS didn't do a good job of picking up the old keyboard so I still had that charger. Neither charger worked. Awful. So much for their QA process that the company speaks so highly of.",2019,09
Great Keyboard and works great,2019,09
Horrible. Bought key board and within 24 hours it stopped working. Amazon was great and replaced the keyboard. The replacement’s lights do not work!,2019,09
Although they have a different version of their keyboard where you can change the lighting scheme I would have love to purchase this one with the ability to do that as well as offering it with a mouse combo.,2019,09
On time delivery and nice quality,2019,09
"The keyboard itself as a keyboard works fine.  However there are a few things that need improvement.1. The backlight needs to be brighter and the individual keys need to stay lite up even when the backlight fades out.2. Need to give the user the option to select to keep the back light on constantly instead of just fading or off.  I'm a user that likes the back light to stay on, I'm not a fan of the fading in/out as it makes it hard to see the keys in the dark especially if trying to find numbers and symbols.3. The Enter key is too far to the right for a comfortable typing selection.  Meaning, that the Enter key should be where the \ key is.  Normal U.S. keyboards have the Enter key closer in this position so when typing we easily select the right key but you have the \ key where the Enter key should be so it interferes and causes us to hit the wrong key.4. The keyboard isn't that quiet, hitting the keys when typing softly the keys still make a lot of noise.",2019,09
"It's an OK product for the most part. There are a few things that I noticed that lead me to give this product only 3 stars.1. The sleep time on the led feature is too short and not adjustable. It turns off the led lights after about 20-30 seconds and if you're trying to use it in the dark this defeats the purpose of getting an illuminated keyboard. There should be an ability to leave it on.2. The brightness on the led lights is not very good. In a completely dark room it may be passable but in a room with partial illumination like a lamp or even the light from your TV/Monitor screen, the keys get a little lost and not easy to see since they blend with the glare from the screen.3. The chroma colors make such a dimly lit product that much harder to see, and you can't adjust this. It would be better if you could make it just green, white or blue lights but the chroma color runs across the keyboard and the red color is very dim. To top it off, the leds are so far under the keys that you get more of a halo effect around the underside of the key than lighting up the key characters themselves.The only pros I have about this product are1. the price, cheap for what it is.2. the quiet no click of the keys (perfect if someone else is in the room trying to sleep)3. USB-C charger compatible.Aside from the things I mentioned at the top of this post. There are some extras that could have made this product better.1. Dedicated buttons for FF, REV, PLAY/PAUSE & VOL UP/DOWN, Mute. Having to constantly press a function button for basic features like those when you want to control music or volume is annoying.2. Removable rechargeable batteries you can replace and charge in the unit when the charger is plugged in. I had a mouse that did this and it was a great feature, and when the battery could no longer hold a charge, I just replaced it.3. The 2.4 ghz dongle is awesome, but also having a Bluetooth option can make this better and able to connect to devices that don't have USB ports, but keep the dongle.I'm not happy with mine, I will return it and spend a little more on a better solution for me.",2019,09
The keyboard is good. it does not have any noise. the light is cool. But sometimes the keyboard would repeat press one key.,2019,09
"Love this keyboard, don’t have anything bad to say about it. Congratulations to the work team they did a good job putting this together, love the colors, works perfectly. Worth your money.",2019,09
"It surely is not a mechanical keyboard but it has great lighting and a satisfying tactile response. For the price though, it can't be beat",2019,09
great product! fast delivery.,2019,09
I like that you have the option to have the lights pulse in and out or keep it solid. The keyboard does go dark if you don't touch the keys (energy efficient I'd say). The best part is how quiet the keys are! Definitely worth the price.UPDATE: I lost the USB receiver for the keyboard and contacted KLIM directly. They sent me a new USB receiver for free! Amazing customer service from this company. 10/10 recommend.,2019,09
I have only had this keyboard for a few days now but from what I can tell so far it is not a bad little keyboard for the price!!!,2019,09
Plug and play windows 10. Had an issue with usb 3.1 took it off of that port and everything has been great since.,2019,09
I bought this keyboard for work because my keys were getting jammed. I have to say this keyboard feel great while typing. I like that it can be used as either wired or wireless. One of the best parts is the rechargeable battery.,2019,09
I got this for gaming on my Xbox One X.  I plugged in the USB adapter and that’s it!! It works great.  Great price for a great product and I would purchase again. Great battery life also,2019,09
"This keyboard is extremely comfortable to type on, and the backlight makes it possible to type with the lights off.",2019,09
"I needed a a new keyboard for my PS4 Pro, and this is the best one I've had so far. It's not as compact as the mini keyboards I've been using, but this one works very well so far.",2019,09
Great keyboard for everyday use LED's nice & brite! Only wish it would stay on longer or on all the time otherwise great keyboard,2019,09
Love the lights and it is quite. Love the charge time and how long it stays charged. Great keyboard all around. Easy to use and set up.,2019,09
"This keyboard is thoroughly average.  You press keys, and the computer reacts.  There are no glitches.  The backlight turns on, so you can see the keys in the dark as advertised--unless it goes to sleep.There is nothing to set this keyboard apart.  In fact, it is lacking in some ways.  For example, there is no way to determine how much batter power you have left, which is inexcusable for a wireless ""gaming"" input device.  There is nothing worse than discovering your keyboard is dead in the middle of a gaming session.  They did not even need to write software to display this information.  Windows 10 can display it if the device simply provides it.I am also not a fan of the key layout.  They got creative with the placement of the backslash key.  Instead of being in its normal position above the enter key, they pushed the quote key to the left and jammed backslash in between that and enter.  Enter has been stretched up to backspace.  The end result is that if you try to type backslash or pipe characters, say when entering paths or escape characters or coding, you wind up hitting the Enter key instead.  Possibly 5-6 times since you're typing without looking, on instinct.  I don't know how many times I have tried to type in a path an inadvertently submitted the wrong path to the OS by pressing enter instead of backslash.  Very frustrating.  The quote key being shifted to the left is also very annoying, but not quite as bad.  If you are a developer, this keyboard will slow you down for this reason alone--particularly if you then go to work and use keyboards with a standard layout.  Maybe others are different, but the absolute last thing I want in a keyboard is a less-than-standard key layout.  It renders useless years of accumulated intuition and experience.",2019,08
"The keys are very buggy in response.  Takes hitting the keys several times in some instances for them to work.  Keyboard goes into sleep mode seconds after you hit a key.  So it is constantly turning off forcing you to jam the keys to get them to work again.  It is pretty and the company sends you cute emails after you buy it, but just a garbage product overall.  I have had to buy a new keyboard just 2 days after purchasing this one as it id border line unusable",2019,08
It looks good and I like the lighted keys. When I need to use my computer at night for a short time I no longer have to turn on the light.,2019,08
"I use this keyboard for my PS4, as I play mostly at night and needed a quieter way to play online with people. This does just the trick and is just more comfortable and quicker for me to type on than those tiny keyboard attachments for controllers. My only small complaint as others have mentioned is some colored keys are easier to see than others.  But overall it hasn't been a significant issue and serves its purpose.",2019,08
"Solid keyboard.  Lighting is a bit dim and the timeout is definitely too short as it goes dark too quickly.  Other than those issues, it works perfectly and the battery life has been more than adequate.",2019,08
The keys are very quiet and the LED's add a nice touch to the office.  However for typing occasionally I do look at the keyboard to ensure of my hand placement is correct or to look at the key pad to punch numbers.  The downside is that the keys are pretty dark themselves so tough to see at a glance.  Overall happy with my purchase.,2019,08
It was a present,2019,08
I think you guys did a very good job of building this keyboard. It really matches my computer tower I have at home. Keep up the good work.,2019,08
Could be brighter. Only 4 star due to inadequate user guide.,2019,08
I’d buy it again,2019,08
"2 year update!  Just wanted to chime in again and let everyone know i couldn't be happier with this keyboard and the company. you wont find a better bang for the buck on this website. highly recommendedvery comfortable keyboard, smooth keys with a good curve on the top. charges with usb type C a single charge lasts for around a week",2019,08
Exactly what I needed in a wireless keyboard for using with PS4. Works great.,2019,08
"Works great! Adjustable lighting. Stays charged for a long time. No chord in the way. Smooth keys. Light weight. Only small complaints - when it is in sleep mode, whatever key you hit to wake it, actually works. Therefore you have possibly typed a wrong key when using a password to open something. Also, you can't pick one solid color. Again, nothing major. I would buy another one or recommend it.",2019,08
"I got this for my PS4 Pro. Works great!  Love the colors, too. MAKE TIME TO READ THE SECOND HALF OF THEIR EMAIL. IT’S HILARIOUS!  P.S: Please don’t ask me technical questions. I had my dad install it and my techie brother got it working along with a mouse.",2019,08
It's cool.  I wish it was a bit brighter and I wish the keyboard stayed lit when you aren't typing.,2019,08
 Great. Easy to use.,2019,08
As far as gaming is concerned I'm not using it for that. I'm using it because I have diabetic retinopathy and it helps with seeing the keys.The brightness is perfect.The battery life I have not ran into a problem. I have used it when my computer is docked and several days have gone by without charging it again so to me that's great.,2019,08
"UPDATED Used to be 3 stars. Now 1. I find the lighted keyboard distracting, but when I turn the light off, I can't see the characters on the keys. I had to buy stickers for the keys so I could use the keyboard without the light on. This hopefully will help my second issue, which is having to recharge the thing when it starts misbehaving. Wireless ought to mean no need for wires! I would prefer batteries. Easier to replace batteries every couple of months than to recharge every week. Otherwise the keyboard is fine. UPDATE The mouse in this combo became laggy after about a month, taking a second or two to respond when I used it. That lag has increased to the point that today I am still waiting for my cursor to respond an hour after booting up. New battery made no difference. Useless! Ordering a different brand today.",2019,08
"Otherwise, it seemed to work fine.",2019,08
everything is great except the enter key.,2019,08
Letters needs to be bolder. Not bright enough,2019,08
It would be better if you had a setting that made the lights stay on all the time,2019,08
"When I turned it on and the back lights appeared in a beautiful rainbow pattern, I was blown away.  It is such a nice keyboard.  I am definitely impressed with this product upon first receipt.What I love best about the product is everything, really.  The keys are soft and comfortable. With the exception of the space key, I love how quiet these keys are. I can type discreetly without being too loud.  I love that the lighting is adjustable (both in pattern and brightness). The ""breathing"" mode is a very neat feature and I like that I can adjust the speed of it.  It has a calming effect!  But I also like that I can keep the lights on all the time or even turn them off completely if I don't want them on.  The wireless feature is neat because I can take it anywhere and position it anywhere and don't have to worry about plugging it in.  I like the little legs on the bottom so I can raise the keyboard up or leave it flat  if I want it to be more (or less) ergonomic. The battery display is a great feature because I can tell when I need to plug it in before it loses power.  I also like that the dongle that plugs into the computer has a little nook on the back of the keyboard so they can stay together when not in use.On the instructions pamphlet, at the very end, it says ""Thinks for Reading.""  It should say ""Thanks for Reading.""  It's obvious that great care was taken to create a high-quality product, so it's disappointing to see such a careless error.One other thing I don't care for is how loud the space bar is.  All the rest of the keys are soft and hardly make a sound, but when I tap the space bar, it makes a loud plastic-y sound that seems to resonate throughout the room.  For how often it gets used, I was hoping it would be a bit quieter. Other than those two things, I wouldn't change anything!This product is very easy to use.  The instructions were incredibly helpful and well written.  It's nice to see the instructions written out in so many languages.  It gives the impression that this is a worldwide company and because of that, very successful.  It gives the company a lot of credibility.  The instructions were easy to read and follow.  I like that the ""function"" keys are explained and there is even an illustration of the keyboard with keys labelled so they are easy to find on the real keyboard.I absolutely love this keyboard and I would recommend it to all of my friends.  Whether you have a laptop or a desktop computer, this keyboard is not only great to look at, it works very well. There is an incredible value for the money here.  I have several KLIM products in my office and I love each one.  I am satisfied with this company and will definitely purchase products from them again.",2019,08
I bought this specifically because it said it was a quiet keyboard. Not even close. It is no more quiet than a normal keyboard. False advertising and False description of the product. I have a quiet HP keyboard and thought this one would be like that one because of the description. This one went back in the box and I ordered another HP Wireless Elite Keyboard v2. Wish I had just ordered another HP in the first place but got fooled by the false description in the headline of this keyboard.,2019,08
"This keyboard is a satisfying purchase. It checks all the right boxes and is great for gaming, work, and everyrthing in between.",2019,08
"I have to change my review from a 5 star to a 2 star. I had surgery a couple weeks ago so my keyboard sat unused for 2 weeks and getting back to it, it only works about half the time. It either won't type anything at all or it types the wrong thing. Nothing was spilled on it, it is dust free, undamaged, etc... I now realize the lighting up underneath is a hampering problem instead of a good thing because if all it did was light up under the keys, that would be fine, but without the keys having painted on white letters, they're virtually impossible to see and that's a pain in the ass. I wanted to return the keyboard for a refund so I could get a different one, but I apparently passed that window while I was recovering from surgery. Also, I have asked questions of the seller, but they have yet to be answered. So my original 5 star review has now dropped to a 2 star and if this continues over the next week I'll leave a worse review and drop it to a 1 star for customer service alone. I paid for a product and I expect it to work and if it's not going to work, I expect to be able to get my money back so I can find a product that does work. I am an author and a gamer and this has really messed up both aspects.",2019,08
Product is as described! Pleased with my purchase.,2019,08
"Letters are small and faint even with the back lighting, perhaps there is a way to increase the brightness",2019,08
"I like to keep office lights turned down depending on task at hand and appreciate the illuminated keys.  This is just for my personal office use.  I would actually prefer the option to use battery power but charging  by USB now and then is fine.  Personally I was looking for a keyboard with larger letters as my eyesight has gotten worse, but sny option I saw was wired, not offered as wireless.  Would also have preferred all one color but for my personal use this is rather pretty.",2019,08
if you type too fast certain keys will not register,2019,08
"I am not a gamer - but I love the keyboards that light up and change color.  I finally needed a new keyboard for work so I ordered this one since it was such a great price and I am not a fancy keyboard person (curved, 2 piece, etc.) and I LOVE THIS KEYBOARD!!  I am probably going to buy a second one for home - this is perfect for me.  Super happy with my purchase and super fast shipping - 5 stars plus!",2019,08
"I charged the keyboard overnight. It lights up; but when I plug it in to Dell computer, the keystrokes don't register with the computer. It doesn't work. I'm very disappointed because I wanted to use it while it's dark in the morn or night. I emailed KLIMtech and no response after 3 days.",2019,08
It’s very lightweight but feels relatively solid.  No issues after 3 weeks.,2019,08
I have not had the keyboard long but it  has a nice feel and I love the fact that it is wireless.  I have a small desk at home and can move it anywhere I need it.,2019,08
"Dislikes:European layout of keys.Definitely not American made like the branding suggests.Likes:USB-C charging.Soft texture of the keys.Lightweight, but sturdy.Silence.",2019,08
"Really nice keyboard, Its far quiet than a mechanical keyboard which is what i want. The finger resist is slightly higher but its fine. Battery lasts me about a week on full brightness. There is not many cons so i am nick picking but every time you turn off the keyboard it forgets your settings. and the actual placing of the off button is unusual, so i just always leave it on now (Its really just to stop the cat walking on it).Anyways, i highly recommend it espcially if your computer doesnt have Bluetooth",2019,08
"this keyboard works great,easy hookup and rechargeable.will recommend to others.",2019,08
"power problem on and off. qc problem, like chirstmas tree.",2019,08
Battery life is impressive and pretty responsive.,2019,08
"Works great, easy to use!!! Worth it",2019,08
It came on time looks nice and is very light weight,2019,08
Excellent product. Easy to install and the keys are very soft. It has a very fast respond when I'm playing shooting games,2019,08
"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. The colors are great (which is what she loves most). It’s also very lightweight, simple to use and reasonably priced. I like that you can charge it instead of having to change batteries. The most important thing for me is durability. She is a child and is still kind of rough with her electronics but so far it is holding up.",2019,08
Best Keyboard I had in a while,2019,08
It did not come with the chip,2019,08
Nice keyboard with a few quirks.,2019,08
"It's great, silent but deadly.",2019,07
"Really cool keyboard!  The rainbow lights look awesome.  I like that they turn off/on automatically while in use to avoid draining battery faster.  I can't speak to how long it stays charged or with what kind of use--my keyboard use can be pretty sporadic as it's just for personal use and not heavy gaming or regular work use.  The charging cable is short for my liking; I prefer to plug it into an adapter and not the computer for efficient charging.  The feel of the keys is nice; they press easily but not too easily.  Typing is quiet.  The keyboard is very lightweight, which is nice for someone like me who moves it to charge it and also put it away when not in use.  It's also fairly compact for a full keyboard so it's nice it doesn't take up much space.",2019,07
"I love this product, it’s a nice design, very light in weight. And does what I want it to do. Charges with ease. I’m happy I got it.",2019,07
Great product!!! Some of the coolest features I've seen on a keyboard. Easy to use and set up. The lights are a big hit as well. Simple to set up and use right out of the box. Definitely worth everything penny.,2019,07
Bought it for my son to use on his Xbox One. He loves it. Works perfectly,2019,07
Was not at all what I expected. Seems very cheaply made. My computer started acted very weird when it was installed as I was using it. Maybe this one was just defective but I do not want another one.,2019,07
"This keyboard is great. I was using it so quickly. I just plugged in the usb dongle and it was ready to go. The lights are so pretty , and the board is so lightweight, This is easily transportable. It has a switch, which allows you to shut of the lights if you choose. My daughter was so excited when she realized that besides the PC, she could also use on her Xbox. It would actually be great if this could come with multiple dongles so it could be used on more than 1 device at a time. However, it’s so easy to switch that it’s really not such a big deal to do it yourself. It charges really easily too. For the price, this is a good buy👍🏻",2019,07
To me personally this item looks so 90's however I bought it for a friend and she says it works perfectly and makes her desk area look ALIVE !,2019,07
"Because the keylighting was not distinctive enough, and because the ""time-out""  was too fast for our preference it did not meet our needs.",2019,07
Can’t see the letters on the keys.  Lights don’t add any benefit.  Return key is farther away than on most keyboards so end up hitting the / key instead. Very bad choice on my part.,2019,07
"This is a neat keyboard! It’s smaller than my old wired one but that’s perfect.  It’s light weight and holds a charge.  I’ve been using it for about a week and have only charged it twice.  It hasn’t gone dead on me so I’m not sure how long it lasts with a full charge, I just need to make sure it doesn’t during gaming.The lights turn off after a few seconds of non use, but I’m sure that’s to save battery.The colors are neat!! I have a lighted mouse pad that lights up with the same colors and it looks pretty cool!All in all, I’m happy with this keyboard so far.",2019,07
"Love the vivid color. It has a nice feature of the lights not staying on all the time so to save the battery life, I love that!",2019,07
My son loves his new gaming keyboard and thinks everything about it is great.I noticed that the product was reasonably priced and arrived promptly.My son recommends this to everyone who likes gaming.,2019,07
"I am a teacher and this is my first wireless keyboard and I LOVE IT!! It works dependably, and I can use it anywhere in my classroom. The freedom is wonderful!",2019,07
Good stuff,2019,07
Great product delivered with exceptional expectations thank you my kid love this keyboard,2019,06
"This keyboard is simple and easy to use. You can change the blink speed of the led lights or if you prefer to leave it on. As well, it has a 10 -20 second sleep mode so pretty convient.",2019,06
Good product would recommend if your looking for a good easy to setup keyboard.colors are great.,2019,06
"If you have intent on using this for anything other than typing good luck. The keys are weirdly spaced, it's membrane and not mechanical, and the position for some of the outer function keys are weird.",2019,05
used for xbox one,2019,05
The product is not worth the price because the keys are too big the lights are dimmed and it felt poorly made in general although it worked correctly. 2/5 would spend money elsewhere,2019,05
"I ordered this after my very old HP wireless keyboard decided to tap out on me with a few of the keys just no longer working at all, & since my family member didn't want to spend the $$$ on a can of compressed air to fix it so I tried a few ways to see if it could be fixed trying a few other tips on my own as it was a a bit grimy/dirty but unfortunately for whatever reason the 4 keys still wouldn't work, so I figured why not purchase a brand new one & after searching on Amazon, my eyes were immediately drawn to this one!To be honest, so far I am really liking this keyboard, especially the colored lighting when it hits nighttime.Talk about a really nifty idea!! So far, I LOVE IT!The one downside I have with this keyboard though is the fact that it has to be charged using a charger to connectto my wireless PC when needed, & unfortunately I'd need to disconnect my separate wireless mouseconnector in order to charge up the battery for the keyboard as my PC only has 2 USB ports on the left side from what I can tell ( as I don't know if it might have a few more USB ports in the very back), which is a bit of a possible small letdown, but I am sure I'll get used to it overtime!With that said, it arrived in a timely & quick manner! I am super excited to begin using it & gonna hope that itwill last as long as it does! =)",2019,05
I love this keyboard! I use it for work. I connect it to a tablet to type my reports. It works great! And I love the different colors of the back-lit keyboard.,2019,05
Absolutely love this for PS4 gaming.,2019,05
"I bought this keyboard specifically to play Final Fantasy 14 for the PS4. It is ""plug and play"" on the PS4 and Xbox one.  It works great, I don't notice a lag. I have been playing off and on for 3 days and the battery has not needed a charge yet.",2019,05
Lights doesn't stay on,2019,05
"Love this keyboard.BUT, couldn't figure out how to recharge. had friend who is much smarter than me. #1 don't throw out USB cord connect this between computer and board. Simple? Yes. Holds charge for long time",2019,04
"This is the most inconsistent keyboard ever.  It worked fine for the first 2 months but now it only seems to work when it wants to. That's terrible for gaming. You'll be in a game and out of nowhere your character is taking damage and you're like,""What the hell?!"" Ive had this for about 4 months and its already failing on me. I can't recommend this.",2019,04
"I bought this because the keyboard on my daughter's ASUS gaming laptop kept having problems with the keys popping off. This is working well for now, and she enjoys the light-up feature.",2019,04
This product has been so far great! I didn't encounter any problems with it!,2019,04
"Just wondering, however, is there a way to control the lights (brightness, color, etc.)?",2019,04
It was for my grandson and no complaints from him so I guess it is fine,2019,04
"This keyboard is great! It works exactly as advertised. The keys are quiet, the design is very fluid and the lights are cool. I charged it once, when it came out of the box and have used it for hours doing work and playing games, still haven’t had to recharge. Great product, definitely worth the money.",2019,04
Backlight works good on iMac.,2019,04
Great product. I already own a wired version of this exact keyboard I was so happy with it I bought the wireless version both keyboards are in use today and wonderful. Don’t hesitate this is the keyboard for you.,2019,04
"The fact that you can't keep the lights always on totally defeats the purpose of buying this product for gaming and night time using. the lights turn off too fast if you are not constantly typing something even at their longest settings.And you can't select just one of the five colors of the LEDs, so you are stuck with the rainbow lights.Also it's not that very quiet compared to an old mechanical keyboard i have, it's only about 10-20% quieter.I hate the fact that I thought i was buying an AMERICAN product because of the American flag on their  main advertising image on it's front page but it's made in China.",2019,04
"I charged it once a few months ago... still waiting for the battery to die, and it get used pretty regularly. Nice thing is that it only uses battery when it’s in use.",2019,04
Beautiful and easy product. Company quick to respond to any questions. Highly recommended.,2019,04
Batter life is pretty good and overall great keyboard only complaint is the light is a little dim,2019,04
"Good quality, we use it for gaming, the backlight is awesome as well",2019,04
Works greatEasy hook up and looks goodSolid assemblyGreat price,2019,03
I bought these to replace my old cheap headphones. Tried these on and they sounded worse than my old ones! Also no returns allowed! Disappointing!,2022,11
This headset is very affordable and has great quality sound.,2022,11
"The muting function doesn't work. My DnD co-players constantly tell me I cut out, so the mic also doesn't work. The speakers are okay, but the rest is junk. I would return, but the window has closed. Please don't buy these.",2022,11
"For the price, you’re getting something better than most other expensive headsets. I do want to say that the people who can’t get the mic to work need to stop I’m using the splitter. That thing is for older tower PC’s that use a pair of ports; one for the output, and one for the input. I can use these on my laptop PC and use the mic fine without the splitter.",2022,11
Bought these for gaming worst thing I ever bought . Can barely hear anything even with the volume turned all the way up. Don’t waste your money or time with this junk!!!!,2022,11
"The sound is decent but the microphone does not work at all. Fix your crap. Frustrating and returning, never again will I buy this.",2022,11
i wanted a cheapish head set for my bf at the time and saw this and figured ok why not. the cord is SUPER long so you can sit anywhere in the room you’re playing in and have a good reach on wire. it sounds good and works good !,2022,11
"Ordered for my son, they didn't last but a week or so. One side stopped working after about a week.",2022,11
Very nice headphones! Kids use them for gaming as well as headphones for their iPads! Great sound quality!,2022,11
"They are not compatible with Xbox, and therefore advertising falsely. I don’t care that they work with an adapter (not included). Any headphones work with an adapter. Therefore false advertising.",2022,11
After a few months the connecter is picky if it wants to work or not- was great when it worked perfectly but with unplugging and plugging in it has gotten weak and no longer likes to work. Would recommend if you don’t have kids that like to play with your gaming set up. Lmao,2022,11
Mic tends to go in and out on occasion,2022,11
They do not work with an X box one S. You have to buy a $30 adapter for them to work. False advertising,2022,11
"Thought these were a good deal. Volume out works great.  However the mic is an out of box failure. No one can hear me at all. Tried on PC and Xbox. My old headset, the cord was chewed in half by our cat, I HELD THE WIRES TOGETHER ON OUR OLD SET AND PEOPLE COULD HEAR ME BETTER THAN WITH THIS SET. DO NOT BUY.",2022,11
"Noticed that after a long period of wear, the outside of my ears start to hurt.",2022,11
Cord way too short.  Sound comes and goes. Sad,2022,11
"Not a great headset, but probably good for somebody trying to get started with gaming.",2022,11
Good sound good headphones,2022,11
High quality. Great comfort. Glows as shown. Buy it.,2022,11
I just got in today happy to start gaming with it the mic you can't talk it static not  Is worth getting it just better off get 50/60 dollars mic I  Regret getting it but sound it good but everything else is bad,2022,11
Fantastic,2022,11
My input on discord comes out muffled and teammates cant hear me. I hear them fine but mic seem to be bad quality.,2022,11
My 3rd time buying one works for all consoles and pc best mic out there for the price works great,2022,11
I bought this headset 3 months ago and from day one it has a weird staticky noise. Now you can’t hear from it at all. This product sucks. NEVER BUYING ANYTHING FROM THEM AGAIN! Waist of money!,2022,11
Great for online gaming and seems like the headset is built very well.,2022,11
"I ordered the head blue cheaper set of head phones with mic, the mic does not work for my PS4. I even ordered a second one because I thought my first set was broken. Just junk I guess",2022,11
This is a $20 headset at best. Not what I expected. I question the reviews.,2022,11
The USB only works for the lights not for connecting the device to your computer.,2022,11
I recently bought this for my son. It’s perfect! We’ve had issues with soo many head sets being cheap quality. This one is a must! I love the color options as well. His favorite color is orange so he’s loving this! Please order if you are considering buying one!,2022,11
So far so good,2022,11
This item popped up for results what's compatible for ps5 and this is not,2022,11
"This headset works alright. For being made of cheap feeling and looking plastic, it does the job. But the sound quality is not good. And there’s practically no noise cancellation. It also only lights up when its plugged in. Highly suggest saving your money and getting a better quality headset.",2022,11
doesn't work with my pc yet other headphones or mics do..,2022,11
"This is a good head set if you need something quick and cheap for gaming. I have 5 kids ranging from 2 to 11 and if the younger ones get ahold of them, I don’t expect them to last very long. They are cheap enough that I just get a new pair when they stop working. They work well, but are no BOSE headset.",2022,11
Grandson loves them,2022,11
You are not going to find a better headset for the money. I can hear someone sneaking up on my on COD but can't hear my wife talking to me from the kitchen.,2022,11
Works really good when you playing call of duty or division to love this item this is the second pair I’ve bought one for me and one for my friend,2022,11
A gift but he loved it,2022,11
"I bought these back in May, it is now October and they're dead. They were great! Good sound, good mic. Then they just up and died. Well past my return window, of course. That's what I get for trying to save money.",2022,11
"I don’t know if mine have a factory defect or something, but is not loud at all, I nearly hear anything from the left side, it’s a waste of money to me.",2022,10
Gaming for fun,2022,10
"As the title states, This headset worked at first. After about two - three months the sound became quieter. Four months later I no longer have sound on the left side. Oh well, not bad for about $30 :/",2022,10
"These headphones are amazing and I love them so much! The noise cancelation is okay, It works but its not as perfect as I thought it would be. They are comfortable but they do not connect to my Android phone. The headphones only light up when you plug them into the spot where I plug in my mouse so I was a bit disappointed about that but other than that, they are super comfortable and I love them so much.",2022,10
aint the best but aint the worst either.,2022,10
"It's not quite as good as some of the high end headsets for comfort and noise canceling, but it does a good job at everything else. Definitely a good value for the money spent.",2022,10
Now I don't really use my headset to talk to people in game so let me preface this review by saying I have no idea how that works BUT it's perfect for what I need it for which is to have headphones in while I game. The sound quality is absolutely beautiful and it goes perfect with my purple PS5 controller,2022,10
Liked everything. Great for Fortnite!,2022,10
"I thought I would give these a try but the mic is difficult because I have to yell for it to pick up my voice, or I have to mute then unmute for mic to work because randomly it stops. Then it's so tight on my head I got a headache in 5min. It was so uncomfortable to wear. My cheap turtle beach ones are 10x better. I just don't recommend.",2022,10
The recipient liked it,2022,10
"Feel a little light and cheap, but really ao far id say fair price for fair quality. I wasn't expecting Bose or Sure... but they work for casual gaming or looking like a little gamer kid in work meetings, haha.",2022,10
Given as gift and they love it!!!,2022,10
"This headset is connected to my controller and I use it to play games. There is a mic on/off switch on the headset which I use to mute and unmute myself when necessary. Now that switch does nothing. No matter what position the switch is in the mic doesn’t work. Also, randomly and often there will be a bunch of crackling and humming sounds that is heard by all players online at the moment coming from me.  This happens even with the microphone not working. Headphones sound quality is nice, but mic needs some work.",2022,10
Hubby got this as a bithday gift. As an avid gamer he fell in love with it. The mic was great and canceled all of the background noise including our 7 month old crying.,2022,10
Excelente,2022,10
"My boyfriend bought these for gaming and he likes them. The only thing he has said is that it feels like it’s squeezing his ears, maybe they’re a little tight but other than that he loves them. He literally wears them for hours sometimes so I don’t think the ear thing is that serious.",2022,10
These headphones are really comfortable. Other headsets that I've purchased sometimes have hurt my head. I can wear these for hours and can't even feel them on my head. The battery is amazing and they charge really fast and stay charged for a long period of time. I highly recommend these if you are looking for comfort.,2022,10
"not the best headphones, they're good cheap ones but the sound on one side did go out eventually. you get what you pay for I guess.",2022,10
The sound quality is good for the price but it is not very comfortable headset. All of my freinds were always telling me to get a new mic and I finally understood why after hearing myself on the mic it’s so loud with the most annoying echo. I have to hook up a separate mic if I want to play games with freinds and the headset just isn’t even that comfortable with the mic turn off option mot even working half the time. It’s mostly what you’d expect for the price but I’ve gotten headsets 3x as good for the same price so I do not recommend. I honestly have no idea why this headset is so recommended it really isn’t that great at all.,2022,10
Love these headphones! Perfect for PC gaming and even Console gaming. Great sound. Long cord and light weight! Highly recommend.,2022,10
"The cushion material is very uncomfortable after a few minutes of wear.  It feels like your ears get hot quickly.  It seems it would have been easy to cover foam ear piece with a more ""breathable"" material.Sound quality is great and the microphone seems to be perfect.But, sound quality means absolutely nothing if it is too uncomfortable to wear.",2022,10
Two thumbs up,2022,10
"Glad to see im not the only one, Had the headset for about 7 months and my Mic just stopped working.",2022,10
Gaming,2022,10
I missed the return window by two days and the product which was a gift ended up being damaged. Very disappointed and stuck with a damaged item. The microphone did not work. Do not get this item.,2022,10
had these for around 6months when the right side speaker stopped working,2022,10
Not good at all,2022,10
Product does not last long !,2022,10
Off and on button stop working and the audio just quit. Only had couple months. Made for a kid not adult ears are to small,2022,10
"Work great, my voice can be thoroughly heard throughout the lobby.",2022,10
Looks good however whoever designed the wiring needs to fix it. Spliter is 2 short to have USB plugged into rear of ps4 to use lights.,2022,10
"Very heavy static, mic lags terribly, unable to use! In this case you get what you pay for! Definitely didn’t work!",2022,10
They are good but I hate that I have to have both usb and aux connected.,2022,10
"I got this multiple times it is a terrible headset, and I hate it",2022,10
He likes them,2022,10
Literally did not work. Pure garbage,2022,10
Two (2) stars because the ear cuffs are soft. Volume key doesn't do much at all for the volume. Literally. I played audio through my projector because I couldn't get any.  games sound loud enough on the headset.,2022,10
Bought for my son. He is not easy on them but so far they are keeping up,2022,10
"This worked one time and then didn't, piece of crap",2022,10
Poorly made,2022,10
"I have used these headphones for multiple years. I am a power user I'd say, a remote worker with hours of meetings every day. I still can't believe that they are so good for such an amazing price. The cord is super long, during meetings I can get up and walk around. Noise cancellation is amazingly good. They are comfortable. They have volume control and mute control on the headphones themselves. What more could you possibly want? I hope they sell these forever.",2022,10
I use this for my Xbox partychat never had issue in the past and I've gotten the same one from the same person but the one I got recently seems to be a little staticky so it's constantly in your ears and in somebody else's ears other than that they're okay just static gaming,2022,10
"This is good for its price, but if you want quality, look for some higher costing ones.",2022,10
Absolutely 100% love this sign. ❤️,2022,10
"My first gaming headphones and their great. Noise cancellation is a little light, but audio works well.",2022,10
"My son goes through headphones quickly (not certain what he does to them) these are holding up well to the abuses of a kid. they have good noise cancelling, because he can't hear me when i try to talk to him. The short fixed boom is wired well and seems to be holding up.",2022,10
My son picked this out and loves it. It works well with our playstation 4.,2022,10
My son absolutely loves them! Would definitely buy them again!,2022,10
"Awful sound quality, mic sounds worse then a international phone call. And they feel extremely uncomfortable and stuff. Returned immediately.",2022,10
Games,2022,10
They are comfortable I was playing with my friend and he could tell the difference from my old ones. But if you want to have the light on you have to plug it up to your console or the wall,2022,10
My grandson is 16 and blocks  us all out now lol. He loves playing with his cousins and uncle in Indiana. There a great gaming headset for him. Thank you 😊,2022,10
These and the other Chinese brand that are exactly the same are pretty good for the price.  I have owned 3 andnthisnis my 4th pair. Like anything else the cable does eventually good bad at the plug end however every set has lasted me over a year. I think the shortest time frame was about a year and a half and that is using them basically every day for hours on end. Sound is not broadcast quality by any means but it's not terrible either. I have never had any complaints from anyone saying they Sound bad or hard to understand or hear.,2022,10
"Constant thumping, would personally burn or smash",2022,10
"One night your headphones break…. And you check Amazon for a new pair of cheap headphones. You may stumble across a pair of nice looking headphones, which are only $19.99 and a whopping 60% discount. Trust me, there is a reason these nightmare bengoo’s are more than half off. You may think these headphones look legit, but once you plug them into your controller, all hell breaks loose. Not only will the legendary bengoos lodge out of your controller about 6 times per minute… if you are ever in a gaming party, I want to say good luck to the other soldiers in that chat. They may think you just bought a new pair of nice headphones, but little do they know they are about to enter the midst of a modern war fare multiplayer lobby. The sound everyone hears when you pop on the bengoos, mirror the sound of a precision air strike happening 24/7 in the mic… one would assume you are in the middle of a war. If you are ever thinking of acquiring a pair of bengoo headphones… make sure you don’t have any friends, because you will lose them very quickly when you destroy their ears in a game chat.I am warning you now. Once you acquire a bengoo… the rest is on you good sir.",2022,10
I use these when playing Xbox online. Very good sound quality!,2022,10
Bought for my niece for my birthday! She loved it,2022,10
"I've had mine for 2 years now and the outer ""skin"" on the earmuffs is now peeling off. They still sound great for how much they cost but I'm told the mic doesn't sound very good. I've since switched to another mic but still use this headset and will continue to do so until the earmuffs completely fall apart.",2022,10
"I don’t know about the quality because I don’t use it, but it was Used by an 8 year old and his 5 year old brother for many months and has not Broken yet. So I know it’s sturdy.",2022,10
These noise canceling headphones do not have hardware and software that is actually known as noise canceling in them. It merely refers to the fact that the headphones go over your ears and do a minimal job of blocking outside noise. These headphones do play noise and it does have a microphone but if you're looking for something that has actual noise canceling tech in it look elsewhere.,2022,10
Didn’t work when I first bought it and did t even bother with the refund don’t waste your time go to Best Buy.,2022,10
Love these!  First timer with this brand and I am very happy with the sound quality and comfort of this headset!!  Cord is very long for my use on a ps4/5 but prob very helpful for pc users,2022,10
"Cant hear that well, doesnt light up as stated in ad.",2022,10
 For the price it’s really amazing it just doesn’t light up how I thought it would connected via just the headphone jack but overall it’s great ! I want to get a pink one as well,2022,10
You get what you get for its price,2022,10
Wires are exposed and the headset doesn't work. Unfortunately the box was thrown out so I cannot return it.,2022,10
"The thumbnail makes this look like it is a Class A headset and to it's credit, the sound quality is better than any set of earbuds or headphones that I have ever used. However; the build quality is very poor. It feels cheap. The plastic feels like something that would be purchased in a dollar store. I purchased something that looked similar on here about a year ago and it surprised me in the complete opposite way leading me to believe that you do not need a big brand name or tons of positive reviews to get a good decent product, but I guess lightning doesn't always strike twice. I kept these since it didn't seem worth the hassle in returning them and it is still good to have a backup set, especially one that I don't care about, but if I had a choice to purchase a different pair, I would and I am advising you to do the same.",2022,10
"Headphones were great for my son, the ear cushions were comfortable and overall the headphones fit great. The other ones he had started to be too small for him. He loved the lights and to be able to mute the mic from the headphones. On the downside they only lasted him 5 months, at first the mic kept going in and out, them the sound started acting up. Now I have to get a replacement. At least these headphones didn't physically fall apart like others have.",2022,10
They didn’t work,2022,10
"These are exactly what I was looking for, and I got then half off as well. I would definitely recommend. I have seen that people were having issues with the mic on a Nintendo Switch but it works for me. It works for my PC, Nintendo Switch, and even my phone. The price is cheap but the quality is high. They are also very comfortable, I hate using headphones, but these Gaming Headphones are great for just about everything. 5 stars, hands down.",2022,10
"Got this as a birthday present. Sounds quality was ok, but the max sound is not very high. I could also never get the mic to work even after about an hour troubleshooting. Would not recommend to other buyers. Spend a few more bucks for something better quality if you plan to game often.",2022,10
Really Cool setup. Only drawback is you have to order a usb adapter separate to use the light function on a ps4.,2022,10
Was not PC compatible,2022,10
"I bought one of these for my son to replace the old broken one he had. After getting this setup, I tried them and was pretty impressed with the sound quality... so I ordered another one.Honestly, for the price it exceeds my expectation. It works and the bass is solid. Buy it!",2022,10
"Decent headphones. My sons both have ordered a pair and while they generally work pretty well they have had a few hangups with them while playing games. Sometimes they have to be plugged and unplugged a couple times before the sound works, and sometimes it just doesn't seem to want to work at all (and yes, the volume is up). But overall they work about 95% of the time and they were pretty cheap, so...",2022,10
"The headphones themselves are okay, but the microphone is horrible. It's not flexible or adjustable in any way, so you can't actually get close enough to it to sound better than muffled to anyone else in a voice chat. It sounds like you're speaking through a wad of cotton or from another room. I have no idea how this has gotten so many five-star reviews when the microphone is so so bad.",2022,10
"For some reason this headset would not get recognized by my PC, despite the product saying it is PC friendly. Very disappointed and PCers cautioned!",2022,10
"I use this headset for my PS4 and the microphone doesn’t work. Unfortunately, my friends can barely hear my voice if not at all. I’ve noticed the sound quality is very low as well; even in high volume. It doesn’t light up unless plugged into a computer and when plugged into my laptop it doesn’t connect. I pray it’ll get better soon..",2022,10
Mine came in the wrong color but regardless they are still pretty good headphones I guess you just have to talk loud into them kinda,2022,10
they last about 1 year,2022,10
My 7 year old didn’t care for them.  Mic was to short. Sound quality was subpar,2022,10
This mic is great for gaming but bad for chatting,2022,10
Got these for my nephew and he’s soo happy the color is vibrant and we love that we can’t hear his game. Lol,2022,10
Perfect for a child  for gaming and sound quality. Great price,2022,10
The reliability of the headphones working is an issue.They were used for gaming.,2022,10
Make sure you keep an eye on kiddos with these headphones overall they are great in sound and support,2022,10
"There's a reason these headphones are super cheap.  Because they are.  It comes with USB and 3.5mm plugs so you've got an overabundance of wires to deal with right off the bat.  The mic doesn't go any lower than the image shows so I find myself yelling into the mic to be heard by my team.  And they tell me the sound quality of the mic isn't that good.  When I replace these, I'll spend more money on a higher quality set.",2022,10
"Cheap quality, broke within first month of light use",2022,10
Nice product but It works on everything except for an Xbox one which is what I have. In order to use it with the Xbox one it requires a $34 adapter which was not mentioned in the description,2022,10
Very comfortable and very good for noise cancelation,2022,10
Thank you!!!,2022,10
"The sound quality and comfort of the headphones were fine, but despite all the options available to me, my friends couldn't hear me when using the mic.",2022,10
When you speak the mic sounded like I was under water wasn’t clear. If your not getting this item for a mic I recommend it because the hearing aspect of it is great I can hear everything it’s just the mic is poor,2022,10
they look awsome and worked great ... for a month. thats it. wish they had kept working because i liked the look of it it was a present i bought for my husband,2022,10
"The game sound and chat sound great, fits alittle tight but it might just be that I have a big head. Definitely love this more than the 100 dollar Xbox headset I got at Walmart.",2022,10
I bought this for my 14 year old son. Now he’s not the most careful but these things broke within a month. Would not recommend for kids but if you treat them right now you shouldn’t have a problem.,2022,10
Can be a little louder,2022,10
sound reflects a lot. don't be fooled by the image,2022,10
Chord way to long spit part for lights doesn't fit into series s controller so its just useless kinda low volume.mic is ok,2022,10
This is the second time I bought this headset and it has a short in the cord. Won’t buy it again.,2022,10
"My son love them. Unfortunately, they stopped working after only a month.",2022,10
"Overall a decent headset for the price, the sound is pretty average, but the microphone is pretty horrible, if you plan on using it for meetings or discord calls I'd buy a different headset because you're going to have a lot of trouble with this one.",2022,09
This headset is so bad when I plug it in it doesn't work at all. Sometime it works for 5 sec then shuts down,2022,09
Sound quality was okay when they worked the kept cutting in and out guess it’s back to the cheap Walmart ones,2022,09
Just not impressed at all these are supposed to be almost 50.00 head phones not on sale. But they definitely are not. No base and I could hear everything that was going on around me. I am returning them.,2022,09
 Noise cancelation & sound quality were fair.,2022,09
Good quality,2022,09
"I bought this for gaming. My dad said “It will be total trash.” But he let me buy it. It came pretty quick. I plugged it up to my ps5 controller and played some destiny 2. The sound was stellar. I then plugged it to my brother's pc and played some Minecraft. Also good. The only problem I have with it is if you don’t have a portable charger, you can’t really use the lights unless you play pc a lot. On the back, there is only one color. A light green. The mic quality is really good compared to an iPad mic. I’ve had it for a few months. Really sturdy. Great for music great for gaming. Great for anything. The noise canceling is not good but for $40 I’d say it’s epic.",2022,09
Used it to video chat during online games works great,2022,09
good for the money,2022,09
Bought it plugged it in sound comes through if the cord is in right spot but the mic doesn't work no matter what I do. They feel flimsy to.,2022,09
Everyone on line is telling me sound muted and I’ve never had that problem before as if the mic is covered. But this set doesn’t have a short so I make do,2022,09
Doesn’t do anything particularly well. But overall it does everything it’s supposed to do. Be good for casual gamers,2022,09
The sound only comes through on one side and it’s not very loud,2022,09
N/a,2022,09
My grand picked this out and it was just what he wantedIt shipped quicklyIt was just what he wanted and it works great,2022,09
"Bought them for my son, they broke within a year. He could no longer hear audio; waste of money",2022,09
Noise cancellation is amazing!,2022,09
I use these for playing wow and they are comfortable doing a 4 hour raid. Sound great and love the lighted feature. Works great so my wife doesnt hear all the chatter.,2022,09
"The sound is really impressive on this headset and I like the sturdy mic rather than a bendy one, you can’t really complain for the price but the mic is mid, it isn’t like a razer mic duh but it picks up your voice just find with minimal background noise. It’s comparable to my Logitech 1080p webcam mic. hope this helps!",2022,09
Box and packaging was great no physical damage to the head set but it doesn’t work. Took it out of the box to plug in and use and never even a small noise was able to be heard smh they literally sold me broken product as if it was new and in perfect condition,2022,09
The headphones are pretty and worked well in the beginning but now there’s a echo. I don’t know why and what happened but the suck now!,2022,09
Sound quality is not that great. Don’t be fooled. It’s cheap. Plastic is fragile. Mic broke off.,2022,09
"Wish they would get louder, noise cancellation not very good.",2022,09
I had it for almost 2 years and I believe it was about 20 bucks at the time. I have bad luck with headphones and cords. This thing was a godsend! It may be cheap but what I got was hours upon hours for gaming or just talking to friends.,2022,09
Only one side works,2022,09
"The freaking thing broke before I could even use it. I was out of town for a few weeks so by the time I noticed it, the return date had expired.",2022,09
It’s worth the frustration if I was you I’d just get a different one,2022,09
"If you have normal size ears they won't fit, to small. If you have a normal size head they won't fit, to big and hang down past ears.",2022,09
"The headline says it all.  These sound great and have pretty good noise cancellation, but they are VERY uncomfortable.  I could only wear them for a short amount  of time before reverting back to my old headphones. I ended up throwing them away because I won't use them.",2022,09
This head so it was not that company when I first got it. Well the texture of it feels nice it seems like it doesn’t fit my head right this isn’t that tight on the ears. doesn’t seem noise canceling. Another thing I noticed while using this for gaming is if there are sounds one way you will hear it on all sides with no direction-very hard to use and play competitively. A second issue I have found with this headset is that it is very bad at picking up noise and I have found myself yelling trying to talk to my teammates with them still  barely being able to hear me I returned it and I do not recommend this headset.,2022,09
Got in and the mic doesn't work.,2022,09
the microphone doesn’t work and the headphone quality is very poor. not loud.,2022,09
My fiancé got me this as a birthday gift and of course I’m now just outside of the return window. My mic doesn’t work so no one can hear me when we playing together and the headset doesn’t light up either. Very disappointed as now I have a headset that serves no purpose to me and I can’t return.,2022,09
Excellent quality for the price,2022,09
Ive had it for less then 24 hours and its already broken. I like the product and they feel nice on my ears but it is a problem that this happened and hopefully this wont happen as often,2022,09
Worked great!,2022,09
I can hear everything even when my game is on loud. Do not buy for noise cancelling. Rated 3 stars for false advertising,2022,09
"Doesn’t hook up to my xbox, don’t say that something can connect to something if it doesn’t, that’s false advertisement.",2022,09
"It's a viable headset for the price, do not expect the best sound quality",2022,09
"The headset itself is pretty, but it’s big on my head without the ability to adjust. The lights on mine don’t turn on no matter what I do. The sound quality isn’t bad it just isn’t loud at all even at the highest setting. I still use them for horror games, but if you like your games loud I wouldn’t recommend this headset.",2022,09
Only complaint is they're slightly unconfirmed uncomfortable and doesn't cover the whole ear.  Especially when you swear a bit.  But with every penny,2022,09
"I used these for my Xbox One so i had to buy and adapter as well as some kind of power source(power bank) to power the LED lights, but other than that they’re soooo cute!",2022,09
Sound on the inside of the headset is a bit buggy and low sometimes,2022,09
Great price onlyComplaint is cord gets tangled a lot,2022,09
"I was enjoying these headphones although they had some odd features like the dual cable that is excessively long… the sound quality was pretty great for the price while it lasted, but they made odd cracks and pops from time to time… maybe from whatever issue caused them to stop working? Either way i am not impressed and even if I were to get another pair of headphones from this brand I would not try anymore at this price point.",2022,09
Microphone is bad. Build quality is horrible. Feels very cheap like you could purchase at 5 below.,2022,09
Easy to set up. The ear pieces are soft and supple. Up and running in literally minutes.The sound quality is seriously lacking. Horrible sound and absolutely nothing I could do to fix it.,2022,09
Cool! Works !,2022,09
Cheap,2022,09
Bad sound,2022,08
"Got this set for my son, who has been using it for school work, chatting with friends and gaming on his computer.  We have been VERY happy with the headset, it has worked flawlessly with no issues whatsoever.  Sound quality is great and the headset has served its various purposes very well so far.  Would definitely recommend!",2022,09
After two months I had lost my mic and now the wire has become disconnected from the headset. Did I say just two months? Couldn't believe it because they had decent reviews.,2022,09
"The sound quality (both playback and recording) is fine, however I find the earmuff portion of the headset to be a bit too small, as it does not fit around my entire ear (and I don't have particularly large ears afaik.) This probably wouldn't be a huge issue for most people, but if you have earrings it might be a bit uncomfortable.",2022,09
"Had an issue they sent me the wrong color first time as well as a faulty headset that had audio issues, they promptly handled the issue and have to say for the price point it's a good headset",2022,09
"This product has been advertised as having LED capability, and it does, BUT......the lights are NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH. That was the whole entire purpose of what I had purchased this set for. Disappointing, and considering beginning a return. Plus, the LED lights engineered into this unity are barely colored purple. And that is what I classify as entirely weak-kneed, lackadaisical engineering prowess.Disappointing.",2022,09
This is perfect for kids just getting into gaming that aren’t yet mature enough to be gentle on a very expensive gaming headset. Would purchase again!,2022,09
"broke so fast, made out of plastic, if you dropped it on your bed it could've broke, it's a antique at this point, do not buy this please, at all costs.",2022,09
The cord is way too long it and it gets tangled up because it is so long and sometimes it cuts out so I can only hear in one ear and I have to fiddle with the cord to try and fix it. The mic cancels most noise but the headset does not cancel any noise and since I have a fan on I can hear it with my headset on and it gets annoying while I’m trying to game.,2022,09
"Not good at all but I did pay cheap for it.  Uncomfortable, sound is not that good and a short mic. I wouldn’t buy again.",2022,09
Bought for gaming. Took great care of them Ans out them up everyday once he was finished. 2 days after the 30 day return window closed; they no longer work,2022,09
Everyone says I sound far away or in a tunnel,2022,09
"Noise canceling is okay, I heard from friends that the sound quality is kind of bad but for a kid/teen or if it's a first headset, it's good for the price.",2022,09
"It is very good in sound quality,noise Cancellation",2022,09
This does not work with my PS4. Will be returning.,2022,09
"This product is very disappointing and the advertising for it is suspect. While it states that it is compatible with the Nintendo Switch and X Box One systems, the microphone is not compatible with either, unless you pay and extra $30+ for an adapter to make the microphone work. The worst thing though, is the return window: you have like 3 weeks to return it, then you are stuck with it. I spent two weeks trying to get it to work and figuring out whether it was worth it to pay for the adapter. Now I am stuck with these useless things. Very, very disappointing. It is definitely worth it to pay more money for a better product that is ACTUALLY compatible with the systems it says it is compatible with.",2022,09
"So the sound quality is pretty great, but the mic seems to be picking up voices from the games I play. I have to lower the dialogue volume (if that is an option, if not I have to turn down the whole game's volume) to get the mic to not pick it up through the headphones. Perhaps if the mic was further away from the headphones, but because it is so short it seems to pick up voices from games or videos really easily.EDIT: So the mute toggle on the cord does not prevent this audio pickup from the mic. It completely stops my voice and sounds from my environment, but it somehow is still picking up voices from games or videos, even when the mute toggle is on.",2022,09
"I turn it up to max and it’s just not loud enough for me, I do however like the flowing pink on the sides.",2022,09
These were really nice in the beginning. I don’t use my headset often for personal reasons. Somehow this magically has a short in it. The sound was never that great and always static like anyway.,2022,09
"Best headset I’ve bought so far. My first real headset, my last one I’ve had for years and was the only one i had since i got my ps4 so i was nervous to get another one. This one is even better. Only sad part is i can’t get it to light up",2022,09
Its only been like a month and it has a short in it. Its been like this since i got it but i thought it would stop but it didnt.,2022,09
Stop working after a month or so idk why people can hear me but cant hear them bought July 12 Stop working September 6 if u looking at this buy a Astro10 instead,2022,09
"Mic stopped working after 1 use, bought it in advance for a birthday and I can’t return it. Fun.",2022,09
"Overall underwhelming headset. Given it’s a cheap price sure it could meet your needs. I don’t like that the ear muffs don’t turn so its kind of uncomfortable to wear, can’t imagine wearing these for long periods of time. The chord connector is obnoxiously long, unless this is something you’re looking for. Mic settings/ mute is all basic controls which is expected with a lower price point mic. Overall, not practical for long term use in my opinion. Will be returning.",2022,09
"My son said they worked well for a couple of hours...  then they stopped working(no sound, couldnt talk).",2022,08
10/10!,2021,03
My little brother got these for his birthday and absolutely loves them. He takes em with him everywhere lol. I haven’t actually played with em but the one time I had them on they seemed pretty comfortable. As for noise canceling the boy can’t hear a damn thing when he’s playing his games so I’d be willing to wager they do a good job at that.,2022,09
Plugs didn’t work for computer or phone very quiet when they would work,2022,09
"Very much worth it for the price, mic and sound is better than some expensive ones I’ve bought. Would definitely buy again.",2022,09
"The sound still works, but the mic broke within a week. Defeats the purpose of a gaming headset.",2022,09
"I love these headphones , there are super great fro my gaming and music as well",2022,09
"2nd set now that the mic doesn’t work, I need my money back",2022,09
It deserves 0 stars for not working. I can't hear my game at all. Super uncomfortable. Too expensive to not work,2022,09
Hello,2022,09
Got them for my nephew. He said he likes them. Just have to see how long they lay because he’s rough on them.,2022,09
It works but the sound quality isn’t good at all so i can barely hear and the mic doesn’t work so i can’t talk to my friends while playing witch is the only reason i got it,2022,09
Best quality best price,2022,09
"My high function ASD high schoolrr loves these.  He wears them to game ad whe he's doing homework.  He listend to music on low to take away anxiety of noise around him, yet can still hear someone speaking to him.  Great product!",2022,09
Works great for our daughter.,2022,09
The sound quality is fair and mic works fine.  The feel is very plastic and light.,2022,09
I disliked everything about he headset,2022,09
"The noise cancellation is great, I had these headphones for a little over a year before my dog thought it'd be cute to chew through the extra thick braiding on the cord. I would recommend trying these if you're on a budget.",2022,09
"The controller needs to be close to the PS4 because of the short length of the cable. I can't even adjust the length of it, sos I have to play extremely close to the tv and ps4 and it's uncomfortable to hold.",2022,09
These headphones are nice to look at but the microphone sucks. Most gamers of any level or even someone who needs to use it for Zoom conferences needs a decent quality mic. This is not that. The positive reviews must only be focused on the sound and the look. Just got these a couple hours ago and will be returning smh,2022,09
"These lasted just long enough for the return window to close. The sound quality and everything about them were actually GREAT while it lasted. The first thing to go was the mic . I’m guessing it was fine at first then my teammates started to say “ hey your mic is garbage” “ it sounds terrible mute your mic” . . . Then after the mic started going,  the end of the plug is now slipping out of the jack all the time and the sound from the speakers almost is starting to sound “clipping” . If these lasted a year or so I would say great buy but they didn’t . They lasted like a month or less.",2022,08
"Terrible, sounds goes and comes, you have to move the cable around to get the sound back to both ears",2022,08
Was a good headset while it lasted. These lasted for maybe three months before they stopped working.,2022,08
Only used a few times and microphone not detectedThe headphones also use too much pressure on my ears compared to other headphones,2022,08
There great headset,2022,08
"Used for my grandson ps4, but Audio doesn't work,  his friends can't  hear him",2022,08
"I enjoyed these headphones and they are amazing for this price. I recommend for people who need headphones before pro headphones! :)  Though it doesn't cancel all background noise, it helps alot.",2022,08
Head set broke not good cord,2022,08
This product is trash bought two for my kids neither even work properly !! One you can’t hear sound other set the person can’t hear you. What a waste !!!,2022,08
In this price range these headphones are top notch.  Replaced my former pair (same Brand) with these and have no complaints.,2022,08
"What I liked about the headphones is they are good for my games. If there is bass or low tones, the headphones feel like they shake a bit. However the headphones are only OK when cancelling noise. I can still hear some vehicles drive by outside. It is my own fault for not reading the description carefully. But what I do not like about the headphones is that they need a USB attachment and you have to plug it in for the lights. The USB thats attached to it as a cord is really short. But over all I like them",2022,08
"Great price, they work just fine. They fit well. I am not a picky person so I thought they were perfect for gaming, discord, etc.",2022,08
I use this for occasionally gaming with some buddies. They constantly complain they can hardly hear me. I’ve only used the headset a few times and microphone does not work well. Wish I could return but I’m beyond the 30 days.,2022,08
Poorly made,2022,08
"Mic does NOT work on the switch you can only hear, but they cannot hear you when you speak",2022,08
Way to quiet but comfortable tho,2022,08
It’s good for a pinch. It doesn’t have the best quality. Also it’s not for console gaming. The led lights needs to be hooked up to a USB in order to light up. I wouldn’t recommend if you want to play on console. I ended up going back to turtle beach 🤷🏾‍♀️,2022,08
Does not work with xbox x?,2022,08
"Mic quality is terrible, people can hardly hear me through it",2022,08
My son loves his new headphones,2022,08
"You get what you paid for. This headset probably is good for gaming, but I bought it to use for my work video conferences, and people complain about the quality of my voice over Microsoft Teams. I will need to get a higher quality headset. Edit: The seller contacted me with an offer of $30 gift card, if I remove my review.",2022,08
Microphone died within a week of receiving. Returned for a refund and shelled out the monies for a Turtle Beach instead.,2022,08
great,2022,08
"So the blue light won’t work unless you plug into additional usb power device. Kind of lame, I mean 7 year old kid was sad as it showed them blue but I guess my fault not reading more. Should just be battery would last forever  being ledAnyways it tried them on and they do block some noise. The sound is pretty good, he loves them. I would recommend as they are cheap and I haven’t tried anything else.",2022,08
Came in a timely manner and sound awesome! Very comfortable,2022,08
"Bad quality. Microphone does not work, if you touch the cord at all, the headphones don’t work. Do not recommend.",2022,08
"The audio quality and fit are pretty nice, however, a key feature I needed was a mic built into the headset.The gain on the mic is maybe 2% making it completely inaudible.  Loud blowing into the mic brings it up to an audible level on playback but far from a normal interaction when conversing.I will continue to use my very old Logitech mic which is far superior in audio capture.",2022,08
Love the overall look! Love how it can light up for when I play at night. The Noise cancellation is awesome! Really great product I invested in,2022,08
Sounds break up. It's not loud. Says Xbox One compatible but it's not. Cheap quality.,2022,08
Keeps sliding off and not much adjustable.,2022,08
"I have a fan and this mic picks it up which is good and bad but Id get for 15, definitely not 30. The price is not worth it tbh.",2022,08
"Headphones are great with amazing sound quality, decent noise cancellation, and I would say it’s good for gaming. I did realize when it’s at full volume you can hear it from a distance and sadly the lights don’t rly work bc the wire that makes the light turn on doesn’t reach when I’m also try to use the headphones.",2022,08
Opening for your ears to small and hurt after wearing for a few min,2022,08
The cord for the lights is not long enough to reach across the laptop and plug into the OSB once the jack for sound is plugged in.,2022,08
This headset worked well until just outside the return window. Worked great when it wasn't broken. DON'T TRUST THE 5 STARS.,2022,08
"I just purchased this headset because my old one crapped out on me.  I can hear sounds fine, but even at max volume it's really quiet.  When I tested the mic by doing a short recording in Audacity, it was super quiet and sounded like I was inside a well covered by a blanket when speaking at a normal inside volume.  I used a different program to rectify this kind of.  The mic is now better volume, but still sounds like crap.  I guess it technically does what it's supposed to, but even for only thirty-ish bucks this headset is not great.  Probably just going to buy a different one and keep this one as a backup in case I need it.  The only real pro of the headset is that it's decently comfortable.  Bottom line, I don't recommend this thing.  I've spent less on better quality headsets before.",2022,08
I bought this headset for my grandson July 5th and the microphone stopped functioning August 21st. He only used the headset six times!!! Ridiculous.,2022,08
Great for gaming,2022,08
Great price,2022,08
Microphone doesnt work,2022,08
arrived with a dead microphone. sent it back.,2022,08
"Decent enough sound quality, but I already have quality headphones for audio. The product is borderline unusable because whenever I use push to talk feature it just plays whatever sounds it making back into the mic as input. My friends cannot hear me, all they can hear is game sound/whatever song I have on. Laughably terrible ""feature"".  It'd almost be better if it just didn't input anything.",2022,08
"We’re very happy with headset except it stopped working after only 2 months, which was very disappointing.",2022,08
"Sad that you can’t get anything from China that works for more than a month these days. It’s getting to be ridiculous at this point. Bought these for my kid, and like clockwork they broke precisely after the 30 day warranty was up. No sound output at all. Maybe I just have horrible luck, but it seems like if it says Made In China on it and you use it with any type of regularity, it’s gonna take a dump prematurely. These things aren’t work $5. Not to mention that it’s a huge ordeal if you want the lights to work and you’re playing on a console. Avoid these turds at all cost. I’ve heard that the company is impossible to get ahold of anyways, so I’m not going to waste my time.",2022,08
Noise cancellation sucks,2021,09
Does not actually work with anything remotely resembling a modern PC.  It still has auto Jacks,2022,08
"i love these headphones! just got them yesterday and im in love!!! its so hard for me to find headpphones that dont squeeze my ears and give me headaches these bad boys do the job perfectly , the sound is a perfect level if u dont like super loud headphones but you still get to enjoy the sound proof quality for yourself!!!! get them!",2022,08
Better than the $60-$100 headsets I’ve bought definitely buying these from now on I use on Xbox series x,2022,08
Excellent,2022,08
good for kids if u a true gamer don't waste your money volume is low even when u turn them up to the max,2022,08
"I had brought the headphones bcuz one,  blue is my favorite colors and two, they were supposed to light up when you plugged  them in, also the noise cancellation….well, I plugged them in and I could still hear the noise and could not hear the ppl whom I was playing with very VERY disappointed 🥲",2022,08
Waste of money. Only worked for a week then died.  Left it alone for a few days thinking maybe I just over used it cause it was cheap.,2022,08
"My son wanted in headphones I choose to order this, when his playing with Nintendo switch nobody can’t hear him.",2022,08
These headphones are great! The sound quality is excellent! I can't put the volume all the way up it just gets too loud. The length of the cord is plenty long enough to be able to move around at the desk,2022,08
"They are designed with a 3.5 mm jack and a USB cable.  My gaming laptop has an output 3.5 mm port and an input port for the mic.  I normally use only USB headphones which is what I thought this headset was.  Apparently, the USB only powers the lights.  USELESS!!!  I will never buy from this company again.  They got my money, which is all they were after.",2022,08
"This is a great back up set for when your good headset breaks. the more you use this one the worse it gets. at first it sounded great the glowed very bright, but after a few months there was a lot of feed back in the mic and the surround sound didn't work at all. made gaming hard without being able to hear call outs.",2022,08
"Provides the best sound quality and noise cancellation for their price, highly highly recommend",2022,08
"Microphone doesn’t work, useless",2022,08
These headphones are awful. Static every time you move. Not worth $30 rather spend $50 and get something decent,2022,08
Good mic qualityPretty pink colorUsed by 9 year old girl,2022,08
The design is nice but these headsets aren’t worth it. It use to light up when plugged in and play sounds loudly when I first got it but not anymore. The sound has to much bass and staticky. From the beginning the microphone would not work despite following the instructions to turn it on so I just used it for work to hear notifications when I stepped away. My computer won’t recognize the headset anymore even when the lights are turned on. Just a prop now.,2022,08
I purchased this gaming headset to that I could work on my computer (and play Skyrim) while my wife watched our television in the next room.  My wife loved the LED lights on the headset!  I loved the great sound and noise cancellation.,2022,08
The have great sound and work what I need them for also the shipping was quick,2022,08
They love them. Use them all time,2022,08
My son loves them but unfortunately they stopped working after 6 months,2022,08
Could not get it to work for my son's PC. missed the return window :(,2022,08
When they worked they were great. But the randomly stopped working about one year after purchasing,2022,08
I bought this headset in May 2022 and loved it...Up until now in August and the mic barely works. Seems as though the internal mute switch is stuck on. Worked great up until this point so I'm very disappointed.,2022,08
The microphone stopped working after the 10th day. Sent them back and bought another brand.,2022,08
Audio is inconsistent and cuts out. Mic also sounds like garbage.,2022,08
"Bad audio, broken mic, flimsy, big, and you can hear the audio even with them on. Horrible headset, would not recommend",2022,08
"and for the prices, probably the best buy I have ever gotten for gaming headphones. These fit an adult head and kid says they are comfortable. Sound is good too.",2022,08
"I wrote this because my friends think I spent a lot more money than I did on this. On a nightly basis I have a box fan blowing directly on me, and I like to watch stuff on my tablet, while hanging out with my friends in voice chat. None of them knew I had a fan on and the tablet 6 inches from my face is also not heard. This is a really great value.",2022,08
So happy I bought two of this headphones!,2022,08
My Mic stopped,2022,08
Does not come off his head.,2022,08
They work great feel great on,2022,08
"There is so much unnecessary wiring, really excessive amount of weight for mic on/off, and volume +/-. False picture advertisement no blue light are in. Not worth the money.",2022,08
I have an xbox 1 and the volume does work but how come my friends can’t hear me?,2022,08
It didn't work for my xbox series X!! I put in the adapter and still didn't work!,2022,08
"These work great, good shutting out noises, they sound great, you can tell the suround sound, good bass, only down side to me, is they seem to be made for laptop, cause the the USB cord for the lights is super short for controller use, you could put one of those power bars on it button it just hangs there, other then that, great buy",2022,08
It works really well,2022,08
Love the color and the sound and ability to talk with ease as I game.,2022,08
Its a great product,2022,08
"The headphones are made for children's heads. the earpieces don't cover an adult's ears.The plastic and shape of the headset itself feels cheap and breakable.The microphone quality is atrocious, and makes anyone speaking through it sound like the stereotypical kid screaming into a mic on fortnite.",2022,08
Does not work with the PS4 and they are not well made. the ear ad came off almost right away and they don’t even work well with the computer. In order to have sound you need a 3mm jack which the PS4 does not have the USB seems to be a power source for the brilliant blue lights. I don’t recommend these at all. The lights are nice but NOT worth it since they don’t do what they should.,2022,08
"I purchased this as an admittedly cheap headset just have something to use until I could afford a better one, and within 2 weeks of owning it the headset stopped working - would not be detected at all by any of my PCs. I had Amazon replace it with another one and that 2nd one failed the exact same way less than 48 hours later. Unreal! I would advise anyone looking for a headset to look elsewhere. Terrible, cheap, awful product!",2022,08
My son loves these for using with his tablet or plugging into the Nintendo Switch.,2022,08
The cord is very long for use with a Xbox controller.  If the usb isn’t used it’s just in the way.  Is not plug and play on PC.,2022,08
I can still hear my PS4 I thought the noise cancelation would have been better and the mic quality is a little muffled but everything else is great,2022,08
I got these for my boyfriend’s birthday & he loves them. They for sure noise cancel because I have to scream at him for him to hear me. You would have to connect the light usb to a power source if you’re not gaming on a computer but works great for his daily use.,2022,08
My grandson was so excited to use them with his Playstation 4,2022,08
Ordered this for my 12-year-old son. The second he opened it he could tell it was junk but he tried to give it a fair shot. Both my boys are really big into gaming and they said that this is pier crap. The microphone doesn’t work at all he can’t talk to any of his friends. I’d return it but my time is more valuable than this item. If your kid is little and he doesn’t have any friends to talk to this might last a week or two. But besides that he was pretty upset. I wouldn’t buy it if I were you I had to order him a different set so just my opinion. If you don’t know what you’re looking for don’t get this ( mom doesn’t know),2022,08
"These headphones are comfortable and the noise cancelling is great. The sound quality is also very good both through the headphones and through the mic, the only issue is the wires. It's impossible to use the lights through the USB and plug in the headphone jack at the same time on my laptop because the USB and headphones inserts are on opposite sides and the wire isn't long enough, which is really irritating when the actual wire is very long and its just the split wires part that's too short. The extender they give with the product also seems cheap. The sound through the headphones with the extender is completely messed up to the point of it being unusable. None of these problems are with the headphones itself, so I still gave 5 stars, but it's annoying that I can't use every feature included. Honestly the product is a solid 4.5 stars.",2022,08
Decent for the price.  It works as described.,2022,08
Bought as a gift and seemed to be received well. Love the color,2022,08
"It literally barely works, no one on discord can hear anything I say just the faintest whispering, had to go back to my old mic",2022,08
Good,2022,08
"I have trouble getting it to keep up good audio. Sometimes it's ok, but it's been going downhill steadily for a year.Mic has only one axis of rotation, so I can't get it closer to my mouth. That's part of the issue, but only part.It's also not very comfy, as the spring force is too strong and the earmuffs too firm.Overall they are cheap and they feel like it and sound like it. I would get something better were I you.",2022,08
Mic cut out periodically and it serves the bare minimum but it stopped working after a month of Use,2022,08
"The sound is awesome, very lightweight, however the microphone is very poor quality and no one can hear me, so waste of money for my purposes, bummer it’s a cool unit, just wished it worked.",2022,08
I recently just bought this headset for my Xbox when I went to test it out. The wire was way to long for gaming and when I tried using it all I can hear are cracks every time I talk. Don’t buy this ever go for a different pair.,2022,08
Great,2022,08
I was using these headphones for my laptop and sound only comes from one ear and no matter what I do it does not work and the audio plays out of the headphones when plugged in,2022,08
Not the best,2022,08
Item defective,2022,08
"The sound quality is good, but I keep accidentally pressing the scroll down on the sound. Also, for my pc the mic is absolutely terrible no one can hear me at all. For pc, get a different headset!",2022,08
"Hello, these headphones didn't last more than 8 months, there is no audio. I am disappointed in the quality and would have thought these would have lasted longer.",2022,08
I have had many headsets and the sound from this headset is terrible nothing like what they have posted or advertised I highly do not recommend these for gaming,2022,08
"Definitely a good product for the price. The only thing I wish is that I could go slightly louder on some games. Other than that, they’re comfortable and keep out excess noise for sure.",2022,08
Awesome headset wouldn't go back to anybrand under 100 dollars to replace this one amazing deal,2022,08
Great product. Works good. Durable. Sounds good.,2022,08
Bought it for Father's day he loves it,2022,08
Overall happy with product,2022,08
"This lasted barely 4 months and microphone is broken. 1 ear speaker still works, other speaker is broken. This is low quality junk. Pay a little extra and get something that works.",2022,08
"just spend 10 dollars more, this is a terrible quality mic and speakers.",2022,08
These headphones are worth the money. Clear and durable (they get dropped a lot). Will definitely buy again.,2022,07
I think they sound fine they were pretty nice and do the job at a great price,2022,07
"I use this to keep out the noise that goes on in my house. I live with 3 kids, so it can get quite noisy around me, and these do a good job with keeping the noise out.",2022,07
Within minutes of putting them on I had to take them off because they were crushing my ears on the temples of my glasses.  I returned them immediately.,2022,07
I liked the quality for gaming and the sound quality is great for what we needed it for. My son uses it for school and for leisure such as playing games and watching youtube.,2022,07
Grandson loves him,2022,07
"Purchased 5/28, received it worked. My son used it for few days but was afraid to tell me that it stopped working just after 3 days of use. Unfortunately, the return window ended. But it is completely useless. Tested it and mic does not work. Super upset rn!",2022,07
Great purchase for a gamer,2022,07
i was hoping for much more sound than i got. mic is...ok,2022,07
Ok for gaming. The sound is already failing on one side. Very disappointed.,2022,07
"This is the fifth item I purchased on prime day that is as good as trash. Cheaply made, poor quality, not easily adjustable. Definitely not noise cancelling.",2022,07
 By far my favorite headset.,2022,07
"I bought one of the used headphones, said it was in great condition just the packaging was different. When I tried to talk with my friends I couldn’t hear them and the mic was not working no matter what I did, terrible quality and an overall nuisance to use.",2022,07
Could not get product to work. And the cord was too long,2022,07
Good,2022,07
"This gaming headset does not light up when you play, this “ONLY” lights up when plugged in to the USB for Charging ONLY. I initially bought it because I thought the led would show when I’m gaming which is the main purpose but I was wrong. Plus the cables are way to short to have it plugged in and the surround system is bad. Wouldn’t recommend buying this cheap mic.",2022,07
"THIS IS NOT A BLUETOOTH PRODUCT, EVEN THOUGH IT SHOWS UP IN RESULTS AS BLUETOOTH.",2022,07
"The microphone barely detects audio if you're talking at a volume any less than screaming, painfully uncomfortable to wear with glasses, and the sound quality isn't much better than my old headset which I've had for 4 years. Even for only $30 I expected something I could use for at least 5 minutes before it gave me a headache.",2022,07
Just opened the package and doesn’t even work,2022,07
The Mic is good and the sound quality is also good.,2022,07
Does work for ps5 controller . Just doesn’t have a plug to light up,2022,07
"I've had these for a little over four years now and I have had no problems with them at all.  Mic is great, sound is great, volume control is easy.  There are blue lights in the headset that light up if you plug the USB portion in for power.  They are everything I need/want in a headset.Edit:I've used these exclusively with playstation/Xbox consoles over the past 4 years with no problems, but recently I've started using them for PC gaming as well and for some reason the mic does not work with PC. Sound coming through the headphones is still fine though.",2022,07
Sound is great. Mic is great. Everything about these headphones are top notch. They even light up and I didn’t know that. I was so excited when I got them in the mail! So cute and so high quality!,2022,07
You can hear the Xbox audio in headphones but TV sound still plays.,2022,07
"I got my headset a few days after I ordered it and it turned out that one side is not working so I notified them and right then and there they replaced it with a Red one(as I requested because it just goes along with my computer, no questions asked. the headset looks AWESOME! I love the lights.Anyway, besides the awesome lights, this has got to be one of the most decent(sound-wise/quality) and most awesome-looking headsets out there, and for a very sweet price. I mean a price like that for a headset like this is very cheap. I repeat...the price is very cheap for what this headphone's worth.If you're a gamer and do not want to spend a crap ton of money for a decent headset, you might want to try this.",2022,07
" No stuffing in the box to keep the product for bouncing around in the box. Which came with dents all in it. Which can cause the product to become damaged in transit. It seems like an issue they could easily address.It advertised sound quality that it could not deliver on. The sound quality is terribly poor. It sounded like I was listening to the TV instead of a headset. Even though the sound was coming from the headset. This is with the volume on the headset turned all the way up.It was advertised as a headset that can be used with gaming consoles. You need a USB for the lights, but the chord for that is splits from the aux input and the chord is only ≈8 inches after the split. Meaning if you're using a controller your not able to enjoy the full experience of the headset, because you would need to be have the controller ≈8 inches from the USB source. Not to mention, the lights aren't as bright as advertised in the pictures.It advertising noise isolating mic. Personal testing found this to be false. Not only could I hear the video I was listening to on YouTube, but I could hear my air conditioning in the background. Not what I would call noise isolation.Some people said the headset was too small. I found it to be too big in my experience. Either that, or they are just too loose because of the padding quality on the ears. I can shake my head slightly and it'll fall right off. When I game I like to immerse myself in the game. Which might mean small quick movements and leaning side to side. That would cause the headset to fall off your head. Watch video for demonstration.Speaking of the padding on the ears, that might be what causes this headset to not be noise cancelling. My JBL ear buds have more noise cancelling capabilities than this headset does. I could still hear when someone opened the front door to my building while playing my game.I will be returning these and requesting a refund.",2022,07
Hubby says these are more comfy to wear than the $100 ones I bought him last Christmas. He plays COD and said that they cancel out the noise of the household going on around him and he's able to wear them for several hours without them hurting his ears or head at all.,2022,07
Sounds ok. Does decent but after 1 month my friends can't hear me correctly. I sound fuzzy and broken to them but the game audio is ok. I'm using it on a Xbox series x,2022,07
Sound quality (speaking and hearing) are excellent but definitely not meant for consoles. The USB and Aux jack are right next to each other! So no LED lights for console players.,2022,07
Stopped working two days after we received them but the customer service is amazing.,2022,07
"Amazing headset but my only complaint is the people talking to me in discord were hearing themselves talk through the headset and into my mic back to them, so I had to work on and fix that. Beside that no complaints",2022,07
"I can't attest to how noise-canceling they are or the sound quality. My kids took them out of the box & hated how short the mic was. So I returned them. Otherwise, I think they would've worked just fine. But we had headphones like these at one point in time (supposedly) & bc the mic is too short (it doesn't come fully at the mouth) - others you're gaming with have a hard time hearing you. This is a review from a kid gamer who SHOUTS at everyone so I'm sure that if they can't hear you bc the mic is too far away then that's gospel truth in gaming land.",2022,07
I’m not sure how to set it up so my son can use the mic on his Nintendo switch?,2022,07
"The sound it good, and people can hear me on video calls.  What I don't like is the fit on my head.  I have a big head and when I pull it open to put on (stretch just a little) I feel like the plastic is about to break.  Also the hard plasic isn't a great fit and feels kind of odd.  I probably should have returned them, but needed them for work so I kept them. People can hear me and I can deal with it since I am not on calls all day.",2022,07
He loves them,2022,07
I purchased this headset for my son and they don't work at all.,2022,07
Had to throw it away because the metal part that goes into the computer came out,2022,07
I actually just bought this for my online meetings and phone calls done via my laptop. They work fine for that.,2022,07
Very disappointed.  My daughter was extatic about getting these. Only to be disappointed in quality and. difficulty hearing with the volume up. Don't waste your,2022,07
"I bought 2 of these headphones for my kids, one came in none working condition and got replaced, however after using more than 1 month both stopped working and return window is over. Please avoid buying!!!",2022,07
The sound quality is on par maybe slightly better than other units in this price point.  Easy to wear not heavy at all.  The noise canceling is not the best but was not expecting anything crazy good.  Works well for the kids when gaming. The lights give it that wow factor for the kids.  No issues here.,2022,07
Great product. Very loud. Can't hear no outside noise. Very heavy duty. 5 star all the way. Highly recommend.,2022,07
Gaming,2022,07
My son loves it. The LED light only works if you use the headset with a computer or laptop.,2022,07
Only headset that’s lasted more than a month. Finally!!!!,2022,07
My son is using for gaming on a ps4.,2022,07
"I purchased these for my nephew and they are absolutely amazing!!! Great headphones for gaming, will definitely order another for myself.",2022,07
they were cheap and not comfy at all,2022,07
Treat them with care for 7 months and they’re already broken. Only one side of the headphones work. Keeps going in and out. Super frustrating as a gamer.,2022,07
Not worth it,2022,07
Low quality and barely can hear anything. I had to get a return cause it was worthless,2022,07
just perfect,2022,07
"Wow. The headset has incredible sound, base will make your belly shake. Not all ambient noise is cancelled, but I can't hear the TV and talking in the background. All that for under $20.",2022,07
"Great audio,just breaks wayy too easy. Have to buy a pair like once a month.. Time to find a different,better brand.",2022,07
"These are my very first pair of headphones for gaming. So far, I love them! I haven't had them long enough to give more details, but I will update for sure.",2022,07
This is the perfect headset for gaming. Great product for the price‼️,2022,07
"After a month, the cord has malfunctioned and sounds is now choppy",2022,07
"Within a couple of weeks from purchase, the connection seems to cut out. No one can hear me and I can't hear anyone. Trying to play a video game, not ""can you hear me now?"".",2022,07
My son loves it n still has it,2022,07
"My son’s old headset was on its last leg. He loves this one, especially the retractable microphone.",2022,07
"Didn't see that the LED lights only work with the usb, and I bought it for Xbox.... so no lights. all the wires and stuff make it look clumpy.",2022,07
Purchased to of these for myself and wife. For the price can’t complain had them for few months as of now still operating fine,2022,07
"This is a decent headset if you're using it for PC gaming. There is no noise cancelation. The loudest volume is not that loud to be honest. The LED lights needs the USB to be plugged in which is on the wire next to the plug you would put into your controller. You can use it for Playstation or Xbox but you can't use LED unless you have some sort of attachment on your controller with a USB port. I guess I should have expected this since it wasn't too expensive although for this product I think the price is a lot. This is equivalent to a 15 dollar headset based on sound quality, no noise cancelation and the LED lights not being able to be plugged in especially if you're playing on Playstation.",2022,07
"I've had many headsets over the years and this one's sound quality is right up there with the best of the mid-priced headsets; however, the quality of the outgoing sound from the microphone is horrible. I have played with the same group of friends and they can barely tolerate the sound of my voice when playing. I've tried tweaking the voice settings on my computer and have been unable to fix it. When using my old headset, there aren't any issues. Other than microphone quality, the headset it above average.",2022,07
I bought this at the end of April and it's already acting up. I have to move it in a certain way for me to hear it,2022,07
"Advertised as compatible with the Switch.Then you get the product, and the instruction booklet says mic isn’t compatible - and it’s not, the mic WILL NOT work when using with a Switch. Sent back and finding something else for my son.",2022,07
My son needed a new pair of gaming headphones and these were a steal! Great price for great quality. My son loves them and said they’re better than his last pair.,2022,07
"I've bought this headset multiple times now, it is very good for the price, but it has a few problems. The sound quality and microphone are good, but the headset it not very comfortable for long gaming sessions, and it is prone to breaking after constant use, would recommend to anyone looking for a cheap headset.",2022,07
Did work perfect bought it for my boyfriend in May now is July and is acting up with the noise in the headset.,2022,07
ear muffs feel cheap and after an hour it just feels weird on you head. Solid pass,2022,07
"it’s works fine but honestly i would suggest a better quality one, it fits weirdly around the head but the sound quality is fine. you get what you pay for basically",2022,07
"These headphones stopped working after 2 days. The 3.5mm headphone jack is also loose, and not a good fit.Don’t throw the packaging away!",2022,07
They are of quality construction and withstand the constant on/off.  Very good product.,2022,07
"I like this headset a lot and I use it primarily. I have two grievances: the cord and the mic. The cord is extremely long (good), but it gets tangled up with itself very easily and is difficult to fix. The mic is poor quality. Everything else about it is good.",2022,07
Works great,2022,07
Must be connected to console to light up but other than that great for the price. Volume was tricky to find but it does adjust.,2022,07
Packaging was damaged and looked used.,2022,07
Son loves playing with his friends and enjoys the sound quality of the headset. he uses it on a ps4.,2022,07
" (Bought for gentle PC gamer girl)This headset is a pretty good one I would say. The microphone kind of sounds like you’re talking on a toaster so I would recommend getting a separate mic setup if you’re planning to use these for streaming or making videos. The volume control is located on the cord, the only complaint I have is that it occasionally gets stuck in the arm of my chair and lowers itself. The lights are not colored it looks to just be regular LED lights in a plastic casing so if you’re buying these for someone who rages at games they could very easily break them.",2022,07
Better then $80 set!! Highly recommend 10/10!,2022,07
Works great,2022,07
good as expected.,2022,07
He loves them.,2022,07
Great gaming gear!,2022,07
"Ok, so I am not a super tech person and I am not sure if this is a fixable problem or not, but only one side of the headphones work. That was the whole reason on buying another pair of headphones, because my first pair of a different brand started to break and lose hearing in one side. I just opened mine and yet it has the same problem. Other than that, they seem great! Just wished mine worked, y’a know?",2022,07
"Absolutely zero complaints.  I prefer wireless, but if I wanted I would have purchased wireless. Comfortable, great sound and it does have an extremely long cord that makes it nice.",2022,07
I brought these for my gaming system. BUY IT !,2022,07
Son uses it for his xbox,2022,07
My grandson loves it!,2022,07
These are not bad at all for the price. Whenever I’m playing a game online they work and sound great. I’ve only had them about a month now but no issues whatsoever.,2022,07
Good,2022,07
Constant clicking sounds and static over the microphone. This product is just terrible and is most likely due to the cheap 3.5mm design with no QC over it. The sound quality is decent but the cheap plugs they use make it a failure since you will end up with the annoying buzzing sound. Maybe you can get lucky and get a headphone with the plugs properly fitted but chances are even a little bump here or there will easily knock it off place. Good luck taking your chances with this product.,2022,07
no sound and hard to talk,2022,07
"Perfectly acceptable for both business meetings and Discord chats, but the sound quality isn't too good. You sound like you're coming from far away. Other than that, it's worked for years. No other complaints.",2022,07
"Product says it works on Xbox one, it does not, headset has a USB plug when Xbox does not support USB headsets",2022,07
The Best,2022,07
Love the over all sixe and make of the unit .. the mic has no problem and one you set the volume to hear others on the phone or computer you are good to go.. TH long chord is a bit much for close phone use so the velcro tab was hepful till I set a tie rap as I workout or in my wheel chair dose not need trip hazards.,2022,07
The microphone is too short so if you have a big head the people ur talking to won’t be able to hear you.,2022,07
"Poor sound quality , like if someone stuffed a papper  towel or cotton ball in it .",2022,07
"They were decently sounding with a good amount of noise cancellation. However, these were more intended for pc because there is two cords, one for sound and one for the lights. The cord is too short to connect it to the ps4. Also the cord is big and gets in the way too much while gaming.",2022,07
"Solid gaming headset for a very good price, over the ear provides good noise cancellation, the plastic materials used in the headset feel a little cheap but I’ve had my headset for the last few years and it still works well",2022,07
Bought these for my sons birthday in May and gave them to him first week in June. It’s The second week in July and the sound and microphone cut in and out. This product is junk and not worth the money.,2022,07
"My 8yr old daughter is new to gaming and loves to game with my 12 & 13yr old nephews. I got them each this head set and so far they love it! I really didn’t want to spend $300 on gaming headsets, these are very reasonably priced and worth it! Definitely recommend it ☺️",2022,07
"Mic is really trash, but its cute and has good sound quality",2022,07
HORBILE NEVER WORKED BE CAREFUL THEY FOOL U,2022,07
"This headset is so big and bulky, especially for a kid. The audio is fine, and is better than most budget headsets. The mic started having static issues after 6 months. Every time you slightly move the cable, the static is incredibly loud through the mic to the people you're playing with. That tells me the internal components are poor quality or poorly put together.",2022,07
When I got this immediately I ran into problems with the mic. My friends couldn't hear me and I could barely hear them. It never picked up my voice no matter how loudly I spoke. They would hear every other word but never the complete sentence. I tried to work with it for weeks but ended up using my Webcam mic for a while because it sounded better and I could be heard.,2022,07
"The second we plug the mic into the Xbox controller, the controller turns off. When we take it out, the controller turns back on. Tried it with all 5 of our controllers. Bogus. Do not buy.",2022,07
Stopped working in less than a month. Such a disappointing product.,2022,07
"Works for about a month fine, then mic goes out",2022,07
Noise cancelation is what my grandson liked,2022,07
Gift,2022,07
"Really nice headset. The only note I've got is if you are using this for a PS4, the USB placement to power up the lights on the headset is right next to the audio jack (like connected 8-10"" away).  Not very practical and you'd have to put a USB extension on it if you want to power up the lights.  I could care less about the lights, so I've got high marks for this.  Great noise cancellation, sound is crisp, and headset is very comfortable.",2022,07
"Worked well at first.  Few months later, all incoming sounds came in sounding like the speakers were blown.  They just keep getting worse.  It's so difficult understanding people.",2022,07
Stopped working after 3 months and 3 actual uses. Garbage.,2022,07
"This was originally a 3-star review, and I wasn't very happy with these headphones. But after working with customer service, they really worked to make this right. Overall, 5/5.",2022,07
"The ear cups fit really good. Have not had a chance to use for skype or other mic features so can't say on that. It DOES come with mic/speaker split connector, which it does say you need to order. LED's are bright!",2022,07
Works just as described.,2022,07
"The product came as described it’s just not that loud to me. I turned my sons Nintendo switch lite up to the loudest notch and even turned the headphones up , but it’s not loud at all",2022,07
"I use this when I'm gaming on my pc, and as my work headset when in traveling.  It doesn't squeeze my ears too much, even though I've got a big head, it sounds great, and the Mic works great too.  I've taken many meetings without any issues on this.",2022,07
Does not do that great. and the mic doesn't really pickup your voice well. you have to talk really loud. I checked all my settings.,2022,07
Awesome to use not too expensive husband loved them,2022,07
my gbaby love them,2022,07
"My son loves these! He said they are very nice and comfortable, the sound is great! He would give them 4 stars!",2022,07
These already broke after less than a week of use.,2022,07
So if you're looking for top of the line gaming headphones these aren't it. But they look really cool and sound pretty good. You can't beat the price.,2022,07
The microphone worked for under an hour. Randomly just stopped working the first night I got it. Hopefully this was just a random dud and getting a replacement will be better.,2022,07
Amazing product!,2022,07
Grandson was happy,2022,07
"The noise canceling is false. At first when I used them they were good I owned 2 pairs of these, and the same problem happened with both. After a while the sound only goes to one side you have to mess with the volume adjustment to get both sides to work. If you move it even a little it only works on one side again. Will not be buying again",2022,07
Works well for Xbox X. Good quality sound. Style is nice. Fits perfect for large heads.,2022,07
Looked cool. Cancels sound ok. But def hard to hear Xbox or a tablet/laptop audio at full volume and also def not good for game chat or work calls on laptop. For both parties,2022,07
Son wanted a pair microphone phone to play with his son. These are really nice earphones. He really likes them. Beautiful blue color.,2022,07
Yesterday the microphone was working fine. Today the microphone sounds like I'm 100 miles away. Nothing changed on my computer. The headset is just a piece of crap.,2022,07
"My son really enjoyed this headset - he liked the look, they were comfortable and sound was good. But the microphone stopped working within 6 months.",2022,06
"Great headphones, great sounds quality!",2022,06
Working great,2022,06
the microphone didn’t work very well,2022,06
Only one side works,2022,06
So great for the price. My son loves them!!!,2022,06
"I purchased this as a replacement for a previous headset, and you definitely get what you pay for. This is poor quality, and arrived in a state where it constantly cut out and the microphone barely worked. Avoid this!",2022,06
This is a great headset for the price. It does what I need it to do,2022,06
"Volume level needs to be high for microphone to work normally but the high volume has way too much base and hurts your ears! Plus the ear muffs are too small. 😎✅ Need to spend about $100 or more on quality headsets like Astro, Turtle Beach or other brands!",2022,06
These headphones so far are great no complaints purchased for 11 year old gamer in May so still fairly new,2022,06
So it cancels most noise out but other people on microphone complain about all my background noise being too loud.,2022,06
"If you’re a single mom like me and don’t want to buy some expensive headphones for your 11 year old gamer child you have, this one’s work great and are affordable. My son has been using it for the longest time.",2022,06
I bought this product because we are a family of gamers that like to play on different consoles. These headsets have been awesome and were easy to use. The sound quality is great and really drowns out all outside distractions. Would definitely recommend.,2022,06
Not bad but hurts my ears after long gaming sessions,2022,06
It came in great condition. The only issue I have is that the mic is apparently muffled. This might be an issue with the audio splitter it comes with though.,2022,06
"I loved these headphones until they abruptly stopped working after 6 months. I know that sounds like a long time, kind of, however I haven't used them that often and they are stored properly.",2022,06
"I have having a really hard time finding the right headphones and when he got these he won't take them off. They are great for all gaming systems, he uses them for Switch.",2022,06
I was excited for this headset but as soon as I hooked it up I noticed sound only comes out of the left earpiece. The right side has no sound.Don't waste your money on this headset!,2022,06
Sound quality is great. Comfortable to wear while gaming. Would definitely recommend.,2022,06
definitely not noise cancellation with terrible quality speakers and a bad mic that no one in the game can hear. i do not recommend this as a gamer to other gamers,2022,06
Works great and looks cool! Great value for the money.,2022,06
"Everything works great except one thing. Microphone cannot eliminate the noise from my surrounding. When I play Apex Legend with my brother, he is always ranting me about the sound of pedestal fan like beeping sound that he can hear from my microphone when I turn on the pedestal fan.Hope this review helps.Everything works great except for poor noise reduction of microphone.",2022,06
Everything was fine with this set. I was in a pinch and needed a new one. Noise cancelation is good - can't ever hear what my sister or boyfriend are saying to me haha. But I don't use the lights or anything. Just for mic and hearing,2022,06
"Title says all. Good for the price, but the USB is literally for lights only. And the mic mute button doesn't work.As a basic generic headset though, A+.",2022,06
This headset works really well,2022,06
"I can hear, but the mic has never worked even after much troubleshooting. They're also pretty uncomfortable compared to other headphones I've had.",2022,06
There’s nothing special about it and the only reason I got it was cause of the positive reviews. It’s the perfect gift for a child….. that’s it nothing else.,2022,06
I move a little bit and it disconnected doesn’t want to reconnect to my controller I tryed every thing,2022,06
It is not working at all,2022,06
"got these for using the mic, mic does not work at all, even when push it closest to my mouth you can hardly hear my voice in recordings at all no matter how much i fiddle with the settings/dial, pointless purchase, luckily i was able to get a refund at least.",2022,06
"The sounds doesn’t consistently stay on, the entire headset feels like a plastic toy, doesn’t not fit over your ears for maximum hearing. And the volume/quality is so bad you can’t hear your game. DO NOT PURCHASE 👎🏽",2022,06
"A little after a month, the connection where the wire meets the plug for the controller went bad, now the headset is useless. Do yourself a favor and get either wireless or a better made headset.",2022,06
I like the head phones. The sound is good.,2022,06
"The Good: Decent sound quality, and relatively comfortable.The Bad: Uses an analogue jack for the speakers, making plugging it into certain devices difficult or impossible without an add-on like a splitter. The microphone is an inflexible piece of plastic and people I talk to online complain about my voice being muffled and distorted.Overall: Overpriced for what amounts to an okay pair of headphones.",2022,06
At the start I noticed that they weren't that loud even with the volume on 50-60. I ignored it though because it wasn't that bad. I regret doing that because now they got even lower with the sound on 100!  This product isn't worth buying....,2022,06
"I bought these headphones for use on xbox and they sisnt even work with sound. I was then shipped another pair ""not the same"" (Hunterspider Gaming Headset Headphones for PS4 PS5 Switch Xbox One PC with Microphone, Noise Reduction 7.1 Surround Sound & LED Light (Blue)) these were given to me instead and the mic doesnt even work on these......",2022,06
Got it for Xbox 1. They're pretty decent for the price. Sound quality it's great along with noise cancelling. Only thing I didn't like is that in order for the lights to work it has to be plugged in a USB.,2022,06
Great for people who game alot,2022,06
"I like stuff loud, I’m a bit of an audiophile, but I don’t like spending a lot unless it’s worth it. I prefer cheap and effective, and that is this.I used to use the official PlayStation wireless headphones that cost over $100. And those were great, but then they stopped charging, and I got these.I freed up the USB port that was being used by the wireless headphones because these headphones plug into the wireless controller.So for a lot less money, it’s still wireless!And they sound great.",2022,06
"Only the microphone jack worked for me. It comes with a splitter but that did not fix the issue. Again, do not buy this product for PC.",2022,06
Bought these for my daughter for her gaming computer and she is absolutely in love with them they don’t hurt her ears and they work great,2022,06
"Misleading information!!!! I purchased this as a gift. You can only use the lights or the microphone and speakers on the ps4, you can’t use them at the same time unless you want the console on your lap. Very disappointed.",2022,06
"I had been looking for a gaming headset for my PS4. I'm a casual gamer and I was looking for something that I could use when I play late at night. I read the reviews for this product and convinced me to buy. When I received it, I was surprised how big the headphones are but it wasn't a big deal. When I tried them on, they felt comfortable and I have been using them for long period of time and my ears have not gotten tired.The sound quality is surprisingly good, with good bass, and I can hear the surround sound effects of my games. The voice chat quality is very good with clear quality. In terms of noise cancellation, it's not true noise cancellation. I can still hear sounds form outside when playing but it's minimal.Overall, I'm pleased with these headphones as they do their job just fine.",2022,06
They are pretty good,2022,06
"Headphones are slightly uncomfortable to wear, and the mic isn't very good. Mine broke quickly after a few weeks with seemingly no explanation. That being said, the sound quality is ok and these are ok headphones for beginners.",2022,06
Very nice and sturdy. Just heavy on head.,2022,06
"The headset is nice but the cord on the actual product is different from the instructions.There are two jacks, one for the game controller and a USB connection to power the lights. If you look at the pictures, the split is further down closer to the jacks than what is explained in the instructions.I doubt anyone would be able to use the lights unless they’re sitting next to an outlet. Also, there isn’t much room to use the controller if the USB is connected to a power source.Poor design of the cord.",2022,06
Strictly gaming,2022,06
"It looked like it does in the pic listing says it works with apple... No clear directions on using it with the Iphone.. Terrible self support and regular support. The info of setting up iphone was basically it works on some stuff, might work on iphone figure it out yourself. The support is NONE they never contacted me back and I couldn't get it to work so I sent it back. Worst service I've had on Amazon.. No excuse for not at least responding to a support issue.. Steer clear of them they don't care about their customers!",2022,06
Very nice headset,2022,06
Great for COD,2022,06
"Great headset. Microphone last about three months before it broke. I’m searching for a good headset and this wasn’t it. Great sound, excellent noise cancellation. These gaming headsets take a beating as none of them have ever lasted a year. I play battle total and FPS so communication is needed.",2022,06
Cannot use the product. Due to false marketing.I had to research this product extra and finally found that the last picture shows a chart.. again on the last page saying an adapter is needed.The original page on Amazon shows Xbox one is supported as it comes. That is false marketing.,2022,06
"The audio quality from the headphones is pretty great, but the mic could be better.",2022,06
Junk. Lasted a few months,2022,06
Audio is muffled,2022,06
My grandson has no sound.I bought it for him .,2022,06
I got this for gaming with a microphone and it did not disappoint. I could hear clearly with comfort and talk to my friends through the game. I also like how it lights up. 😀,2022,06
"*Edit*The company did reach out to me to tell me they are getting a new supplier. Maybe the mic will work better for future customers. They offered a replacement/refund as well, but I have already purchased a new headset that works a lot better. They also tried to talk me into deleting the below review, but it was my honest experience with the headset that I received.*Original Review*This worked well for a very short while, but now the microphone is way too quiet and nobody can hear me (in Discord). The sound quality through the headphones is still good, but I can't use it to game with other people because they can't hear me. It's such a shame. It also doesn't have an option to use the laptop's microphone instead of the headset, so I can't just use it for the headphones.",2022,06
The cord is very long and usually gets in the way. When I first got my it would make static noises and also echo other people. I suggest getting a different mic.,2022,06
My son had this for maybe 4 months and the cord started coming out of the headset itself. Then wouldn't work. This seller took their time and sent us a new headset after the 1st one we had broke. They are awesome and take very good of their customers.,2022,06
Bought this and it stopped working within a year. Terrible product. Don't buy and save your money for a better product.,2022,06
This is the 2nd set we have purchased and they both stopped working within 3-5 months!,2022,06
Broke early on,2022,06
They kind of work. I have to unplug and plug back in from time to time because the sound quits. I should have not been so cheap.,2022,06
"Husband needed a new headset, got this for his birthday and he was shocked it was affordable because he said the quality during conversation with teammates were comparable to his expensive turtle beach headset if not better! 10/10 recommend!",2022,06
As described,2022,06
The headset was nice lookin but stopped working after 4 days,2022,06
"The microphone on these headphones didn't seem to work at first but then found it had to be in just the right spot, which is not normal. They also DO NOT light up like the picture shows them doing. This doesn't affect how they are used but they shouldn't advertise them lighting up.",2022,06
"Microphone doesn't work.Bad sound Quality,Dont buy",2022,06
My 15yr old daughter loves them..,2022,06
"It could easily just be me, however I found the headset to be to small around my ears and rather overly tight as well causing some discomfort. That said, the headset is beautiful and works perfectly.",2022,06
No complaints,2022,06
Quality,2022,06
So far so good,2022,06
Bad,2022,06
It’s good for gaming. The only way it lights up is if you plug the usb into your laptop or charger adapter. I also use it for my phone but it has a shortage.,2022,06
Son loves it A++,2021,06
"Originally not happy. Couldn’t get the speaker to work. My grandson was so disappointed. After trying several different things, we finally got the speaker to work and my grandson is gaming with his friends. Definitely worth the money.",2022,06
"If you have an extremely large head, then this is the headset for you. I mean a round head. Like a basketball or a balloon shape head. If you don't don't bother, they're just going to fall off your head",2022,06
This was a Birthday  present for my son 2022. One ear piece has already quit working and the microphone is now staticky sounding and his friends can’t understand him. Of course the return window has already closed. Not happy.,2022,06
not enough padding for my ears,2022,06
We used these headphones for virtual school with a busy household. They worked great!,2022,06
"My headphones arrived faulty and do not connect to my PC properly. I followed the setup instructions provided, watched videos, yet nothing helped. Returning these ASAP.",2022,05
Exactly as described,2022,05
Good sound,2022,05
This headset is ok for a little kid for gaming or for someone starting out. The sound quality is not the best. This headset is meant for a pc system and for a console system.,2022,05
"hot garbage, sounds okay but the mic is trash.",2022,05
Great and affordable.,2022,05
It's very big and clunky but give very competent sound and bass cancelling outside noises. It's useful for when you don't have to put batteries in your wireless gamer headphones.,2022,05
I have tried everything to get the mic to work on this headset to no avail.,2022,05
"My family bought 2 of these for our twins. In less than a month, one of the mics broke. The other set had one of the ear speakers break after only a week. So disappointed.",2022,05
My daughter games and needed a new headset. This one works nicely for her.,2022,05
My son broke his expensive so I looked for a cheaper alternative and found a great product he uses it on his ps4. Would buy again,2022,05
"Honestly I’m very surprised by the sound quality. The noise cancelling I would say is 9/10, sometimes I’m afraid i can’t hear if someone calls me at home. And the foam on the ear cups and the head part is really soft. I have a longer head so these burly fit me. But over all I am really enjoying them. Now to see if they last long.",2022,05
Really comfortable great sound quality from both ends and it can be used for a lot of devices.,2022,05
"clarity all the way, great product",2022,05
"Good sound quality, but the mic is a little quiet and I ended up with a short in the wire very quickly. Shows me as always talking and my friends say there’s a low pitch buzz always coming from the mic.",2022,05
I was a little harsh with my first review. The mic doesn't work as well as I would like but the company is amazing to work with. Good purchase!,2022,05
The wires are flimsy around the audio jack and mic jack. To the point that you have to adjust them a specific way to get sound to come out of both sides of the headset. Accidently move the wire and you have to try to readjust it.,2022,05
This does not work with my Xbox One! I repeat does not work and now I'm stuck with it forever,2022,05
"I bought these maybe a couple months ago, they were working great but all of a sudden now nobody can hear me. I’m using them on Xbox one. I’ve tried changing settings but nothing has worked. Very disappointed.",2022,05
"Max volume is still very low, you can barely hear.",2022,05
doesn’t work at all for xbox one s,2022,05
Not as loud as I wanted but still a great buy and came with adapter. I will probably like it more with more use.,2022,05
Great,2022,05
"My husband is fascinated with these! He loves the colors, the lights, & the quality. Definitely a good buy!",2022,05
Great value for the price. Meets my needs perfectly.,2022,05
"Nothing to envy to a $200 headsets, for that price im more than pleased",2022,05
"got for my 6 year old, fit his head perfectly!",2022,05
We used these one time and they worked great. We tried to use them again an hour later and they didn’t work at all! Waste of money. My boys were so disappointed.,2022,05
My son loves them!,2022,05
"Inexpensive, fits over my ears, so no ear pain like other headsets, descent sound quality.",2022,05
"The headset was fine at first, but after a week or two the mic barely picks anything up.",2022,05
Used it for ps5. Works great,2022,05
Product dont work,2022,05
My boyfriend uses them for his PlayStation and have used them to listen to music from his cellphone. He is in love with them!,2022,05
For the price you really can’t beat this deal. The sound is great and they are comfortable.,2022,05
Plug n play east to use sound and audio works great,2022,05
The sound quality is amazing for gaming! Cancels out noise very well,2022,05
The headset looks cool but the mic is too loud and muffled.,2022,05
The USB plug for the PC is totally useless as the PC will constantly complain about an unknown device plugged into the port. Contacted support. What a joke. Told me to return the product for another one. NO THANK YOU!!!! This goes in the garbage where it belongs. No quality control.They sent me an email. Wanted to send me a replacement! NO! Already threw it away as it stopped working.You can't buy my good review with cash or another of your defective products!DO NOT BUY!!!I wish I had read the customer reviews.JUNK!!!,2022,05
"This product was a little disappointing to be honest. For one, I wish I had paid attention to the fact that this is not wireless. Second, the lights don't come on with mic jack. Which sure it wouldn't make sense to but it really should have just been a USB with an adaptor. Otherwise if you don't care about lights, it works fine. I'd say it's better suited for PC gaming since usually there's a mic jack next to a USB port. But not for consoles. Its not the worst. Just the sound quality is kind of minimal. It doesn't play music too well. It can get loud but then the sound gets shrill amd will induce headach. Truthfully, I wouldn't buy this again.",2022,05
Not happy with this headset. Other gamers complained about the background sounds and made a remark about buying a cheap headset.,2022,05
Great product for gaming,2022,05
I’m a big time gamer. All my friends say it sounds good on their end  So it’s a good headset for gamers  plus I hear them just as good .,2022,05
I recently ordered these headphones after having a Logitech headset go out on me after a few weeks of owning them. For the price they are really good.,2022,05
"Keep in mind this is my first Bengoo headset so I assume it's a rare case. However, this was not a great first impression. I was using it on my PC, but It probably works best as a console headset.The headset itself looks great, the speaker sounds nice, and I love the design for not only the aesthetic but the mic buttons on the cable as well. Unfortunately, that's all positive comments I can give.-The setup app did not connect to the headset, no matter if I enabled it on windows defender or restarted the computer for it to reset. Not only that, it takes 2-3 attempts to open the app. I needed to end the background task of the first attempt to open it. Then it didn't even recognize the headset at all, no options to configure or anything.-Trying to use another app for the setup was annoying and had me constantly checking the ports. When I finally got connected to the mic, I was greeted with the sound of rain-like static that was louder than my own voice volume.-The volume of the mic itself was so low, I needed to increase it to the maximum value. It also has a default super bass feel to it that makes your voice more muffled than recognizable. I was hoping to replace my PC gaming headset but I can't say I feel confident buying this one.",2022,05
it works good for a year but after the mic went out I had to order A new adapter and a month later the mic stoped working agan the adapter was 5$,2022,05
"This is by far the WOSRT head set I’ve yet to get. Only two weeks in and I absolutely despised it.1. The mic is way to far away from your mouth. Even with sensitivity all the way up, my friends could barely hear me.2. It’s a fixed mic. All it can do is go up and down.3. Far to stiff. Feels like a vice around my head.4. Mic quality is garbage. Sounds canny and fuzzy.Honestly you can buy better headsets for the same price. Not as good but better than this dumpster fire of a headset. At least it’ll make decent target practice",2022,05
They fit very well and have amazing sound quality.Very long cord as well. Recommend a ton.,2022,05
For the price I can't complain good beginner headset for gamer,2022,05
This is amazing. Exactly how it says. Gave it for My husband to game and talk to friends and he absolutely loves it ❤  I love the multi color options!,2022,05
Wore for like 5 mins and had to take them off because the ear cushion is really small it pressed up against my ears. Probably fits kids only,2022,05
I bought this headset for my son for Christmas and it's now May and he hasn't broken them yet so that's a win. He seems to like them a lot and says they're comfy and the sound is pretty clear in them.,2022,05
Cheap and doesn’t work.,2022,05
It works perfectly fine but it is not what I need.,2022,05
Was able to connect the dual cables to the back of my PC with ease. Great for playing online and chatting with others.,2022,05
Great Sound and Mic quality. I have 3 of them. Only consistant Issue on all 3 were the mute switch either didn't work or stopped working.,2022,05
Has way to much static and chooses when it wants to work!!,2022,05
"I am an adult with a smaller head and sometimes I feel like these headphones are slipping off when I'm gaming. But that is really the only complaint I have. I tend to just use one of my beanies to keep it from slipping. I don't like the ""cutesy"" headphones they make for smaller heads that's why I chose this one. Otherwise, I like these headphones alot.",2022,05
"My 3 boys love to game on their computer, Xbox and Nintendo switch. This headset is great for all gaming experience. Great sound and microphone. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the cord can get tangled easily and when that happens it doesn’t give the 5 star experience. I have bought several of these though and will continue to get the same as they get worn out! The price for the quality of the product is 100% worth it!",2022,05
I have 1 year and 6 month with mine and havent run in any issues so far.,2022,05
My husband enjoys movies however his taste and my taste aren't the same.  Since getting these headphones we can be in the same room with him enjoying a movie on his laptop while I'm watching a movie on tv.  My husband says the sound quality of these headphones is good.  As far as noise cancelling...he says that some background noise does creep in but not enough to interfere with whatever movie he's watching.  I'm pleased with these headphones and will probably buy another pair for my grandson.,2022,05
"Don't waste your money on this junk. DOES NOT WORK. Had it a few days, DOESN""T WORK. First the left ear went out, then the right completely. Total pile of junk.",2022,05
My son loves it,2022,05
"They were a decent headset for the price. But they weren't for me.Pros -Long cordGlasses friendlySemi sound proofThe mic was pretty decent sounded like I was in a tunnel sometimes thoEasy to adjustCons -Did not fit well over my ears, they were kind smallThe texture was also icky. To me it felt like skate board wheels again my ears, just squishyThey don't light up unless they are plugged into the PC. But that really didn't matter for meOther that that, they were pretty ok. Just not for me. Hence why I return mine, and try something else. So if I you wanna give them a try still, they may be great for you! If not the return was as easy as heck.",2022,05
Impressed by some $30 headphones! My only gripe is the mic is on the left side of your face and you cant rotate the mic to switch it to the right. Other than that I'm happy!,2022,05
Right out of the box he didn't like them. He didn't try them.,2022,05
"I bought this because it is a gaming headphone and the reviews looked to be a good quality. However, I plugged it into my PC and at first only the audio output was working and recognized on my computer. When I unplugged it to see if that would fix the microphone not being recognized, the sound stopped working. I ran a troubleshoot program and the PC doesn't even acknowledge the headphones being plugged in with the jack. Looked online, its a very common problem.",2022,05
"I seen in the description that it said it would work for xbox one. I went no further. After receiving the head phones, we noticed it did not work for xbox one. So i opened the instructions and there we seen that an adapter is needed for xbox one. And it is $40. Dont buy these for xbox, as between this and the adapter you will spend almost $100….",2022,05
Got this for my boys and they love it. Easy to use and is noise canceling.  I scream for them and they honestly dont hear me lol. Its also made of like metal. Good material and prettier in person,2022,05
"Awesome!! Gaming stereo set, I am purchasing another one for a friendThank you Bengoo",2022,05
I use this headset on my ps4 and it works amazing!,2022,05
"Pretty good sound quality, however the input for whatever reason comes out muffled on Discord. Even if I have the volume up on the computer and the application, my friends keep saying I'm muffled so it's a little disappointing.",2022,05
I’m not sure what he is doing but there is a sharp piece of plastic cutting him. Works great though!,2022,05
"Gaming headset low cost, nice colors and perfect fit and the customer service team is great",2022,05
"Not horrible, it's just a good, basic gaming headset. My old wired turtle beach headset still sounds better than this thing. Got that headset during Xbox 360 days and they are still better than this one sound wise. It's to be expected at this price point I suppose. You get what you pay for.",2022,05
This product is nice and easy to use but the sound quality isnt the best id much rather go with some turtle beach headphones or just earbuds all together.,2022,05
Has a cool look and very comfortable but after just a few days it stopped working. It sucks because i ordered this a head of time for my son for Easter and unfortunately the return window has closed so I'm out $23 and my son has no headset.,2022,05
"I liked that the colors really popped so I almost never lost it, but ultimately, it's just a pair of headphones with a really static-ey mic.",2022,05
don't know why they just stopped working after a month. I can still hear and but no voice. and they aren't really that comfortable nor are they that bright.,2022,05
"The cord tangles around itself in several locations, the internal wiring is damaged and the product has failed in two months.",2022,05
When I talk people say they can’t hear me talking,2022,05
"I work from home & needed a longer cord for my headset & this works perfect! I can still hear some sound around me, but it does cancel a lot. I’m happy with this!",2022,05
"I don’t really like leaving bad reviews but these headphones were not what I was hoping for. I got these for my boyfriend and now I feel like crap cuz I feel like I got him cheap headphones for Christmas. They look cool and the sound quality is fine, not the greatest but it does the job for the most part. The microphone is not the greatest and all his friends say they can barely hear him on the other end no matter what he does and we have messed with this since December and it’s not gotten better. The mic picks up a lot of background staticky sounds and if you want the lights to be on they have to either be plugged into a portable battery or plugged in plugged in or plugged into your gaming conceal or computer. I’m just a little disappointed because the reviews seemed great on this but oh well. They are cool but not the best for gaming",2022,05
I bought this for my son for a microphone to talk to his friends on PS4. The microphone does not work at all.,2022,03
First of all none of the cords work plugging it both into the PlayStation controller. Secondly in order to talk in here you can’t do it simultaneously you have to change it each time course. This would be a pain in the ass but it never works. Garbage I’m returning it tomorrow I want a full refund in the Premier brand,2022,05
My son used these for 5 minutes and the kept cutting out. These are awful.,2022,05
Sound Quality was so bad I just bought a Razer.  You get 2 stars automatically if I have to use TWO in between wires.  Engineering genius.  Lets add 3 more Jacks/USB which is the weakest link of every headphone in existence.  Honestly you might as well pay 5x for wireless then all this Chinese Crap that is gonna break in a few months of wear and tear.,2022,05
It's a bit bulky but I find I hear clearly. I like that it has a volume button. I have it for 2 months now and it hasn't broken yet although it does feel a bit wobbly like it could break if you're not caref with it. The microphone could be longer so others can hear you more clearly,2022,05
"I've tried and tried to set up the microphone to work. I can hear everyone talking, but no one can hear my voice. (I'm using a laptop, and non of the laptop today has two plug-ins for the microphone and speaker(One is pink and one in green)). The microphone is ON, but the PC system doesn't know about the device. I've tried 3 different laptops. None of them works.",2022,05
"For me, I really liked the headset.  Not to loud, great sound quality, and at a good price. If you're looking for wireless, this one is not.",2022,04
This product has a very low quality sound. It sounds weak. The microphone has to be turned up and is very low quality. It sounds like a cb radio.,2022,04
My son loves his new headphones…Works very well with his PS4,2022,04
"This is a good set of headphones, but if you use the microphone for gaming the majority of people say you sound like you are talking into a tin can down a hallway! LOL",2022,04
"They work just fine ,, nice price",2022,04
Headset is comfortable. Sound quality is good. Chat is a little too quiet. Overall quality is better than I expected for the money. I highly recommend these for casual gamers.,2022,04
"I bought my first set on July 12, 2020, and they were great! I broke a wire and was so satisfied with the first set I ordered the exact same model. But on the new ones, unless I turn the column down really, really low the sound distorts.I thought I would like these as much as the last ones so I destroyed the box, I wish I hadn't or I would send this back in a heartbeat. If you order and get a set that does not distort you will be happy with them but these that distort and not ""much pumpkin.""",2022,04
Could barely hear anything with all the volume turned up. returned.,2022,04
"Not sure how widespread a problem it is, but this headset is super uncomfortable on my ears to wear. Other than that the sound quality and mic on it is superb.",2022,04
I had given a 2 star review. The lady Julia got in touch with me and replaced my son's gift with a new pair.  The new pair are wonderful and are working perfectly fine now.  He was very excited to receive the replacement. So thank you so much,2022,04
Worked really well and enjoyed them for a good two months until they just up and stopped working out of nowhere.,2022,04
"I love this product; there comfortable, and they fit perfectly.",2022,04
its really bad,2022,04
"The good? The Price and they work.The bad.Very short coord, more suited for a laptop user than a desktop.Requires both usb and 3.5mm ports to be used for either to work, disconnect one and headset stops.Very poor sound.  Its too quiet, forget noise cancellation, you can hear your phone ring on medium with these on full sound on youtube.For some reason, the left ear is hotter than the right side, assuming because mic is on the left side?I have bought headphones half this price from Sades, that had much better sound and coord length, but sadly they didnt have red and black anymore.  Should of went with blue and black.  This headset was twice as expensive and nothing to be happy about.I will not buy another from this company",2022,04
"Got this a couple months back, arrived broken. Could not talk to others but could hear others. requested a refund and was told a replacement will come in a week or two. never got a replacement. will never buy a mic off amazon again.",2022,04
"Sounds is decent, can hear other crisp and clear, if you want the lights to work plug in the usb-a. Long cable so you aren't tied so close to your device/controller.",2022,04
Bought this for my husbands gaming and it was great! Sounds quality is excellent.,2022,04
Great sound!,2022,04
"For the price I paid for this headset it’s amazing. It’s actually the closest to the more expensive high quality headset that I have found so far. It’s pretty good at blocking out background noise, the sound effects and voices are clear to hear and can go pretty loud if you choose to turn the volume up. It sits quite comfortably on my head, I have a smaller head as I’m a female and I also wear glasses when I’m gaming so I was thoroughly surprised to find there wasn’t too much pressure on my glasses or my ears. I would highly recommend this headset. 10/10.",2022,04
"coming from the logitech G series headphones, the bengoo headphones are more than adequate for gaming. loud and crisp. comfy. only down side is the mic portion is not bendy, I like the mic closer to my face.",2022,04
My bf loves his new headphone. The cord is kind of long but he hasn't complained.,2022,02
Only took a month or so for the mike to go out.,2021,09
"I like that it sounds/noise cancellation really good . What i don't like is that it's heavy and too small/tight for my big 20 year old's head(58.5cm or 23 inches in circumferences). Gaming for long time like ~2 hours make you really dizzy aftereffect are bad headaches, nausea, and disorientation due to uncomfortable. So i don't really recommends this for adults or kids with big head.I would like if this headphone extends a bit more maybe like 1 inch. it would make the grip less, so it won't be uncomfortable.",2022,04
All I hear is static and I can barely be heard from others. Very unhappy,2022,04
The headset was great for my 9 year old boy,2022,04
Sone loves it,2022,04
"Mic wore out after a month of use, bummer",2022,04
The Mic Does not work but the sound quality is great,2022,04
Came in new condition and everything works perfectly awesome!!,2022,04
My grandson asked for these and loves them. So do the adults in the room : ),2022,04
Remedied,2022,04
"Bought these for my son for his bday, ordered them ahead of time and put back. By the time he received these as a gift they worked for a whole 2 weeks and the sound went out in them. Highly disappointed that I couldn't swap out since they were out of that time frame.Seller reached out about giving refund if I edited or removed comment back in February and I haven't received any update and it's almost May. Definitely not worth the money",2022,04
You can’t speak to anyone when you use them . I’ve checked all the settings and nothing .,2022,04
This headphones overall are good but when I was using the microphone it seemed to glitch out a little but everything else else is fine,2022,04
My son loves his headset. But don't keep throwing them and being rough will break,2022,04
Bought these for my son as a birthday gift And was so disappointed when he realized they did not work at all. The first bad review I left was deleted when the company promised a $25 gift card if we would delete it. We deleted the review and never received the gift card so here is the second bad review. They are terrible. They do not work and the quality of material feels very fragile. I would not recommend.,2022,04
Save your money. Used them 2 times and they broke,2022,04
"They fit well, came fast and are durable",2022,04
"The only complaint I have about this headset is the cord. It gets very  twisted up. I guess it's the material wrapped around the actual cord? Idk, but besides that, for the price it's a great headset.",2022,04
"I bought these for my brother, he loves this headset.",2022,04
1. The headphones don’t fit adult ears… 2. The headphones aren’t very loud at all. I turned them all the way up just to actually hear footsteps in my game. 3 the lights don’t work unless your in pc ( I don’t care too much about that) 4. The mic sounds terrible. My friends clowned me for having such a god awful mic. This would be the last gaming headset I would buy. Don’t waste your money on this…,2022,04
The mic apparently blips in and out.,2022,04
My husband loves these.,2022,04
These headsets have great sound which I was surprised. The transmit volume is a little low but you can still be heard and for me it doesn't fit well but my daughter said they do her. After hearing the sound from these I am probably going to order me a new pair cause mine apparently are horrible but I won't these cause they just don't fit me well. For a kid I would recommend them in a heartbeat.,2022,04
Use for desktop computer. Works great.,2022,04
"not the worst but definitely not the best, id keep shopping and maybe spend a little more money and get something wayyyyyy better",2022,04
It allows me to play with my friends. I hear clear and rhetoric bbn was reasonable.,2022,04
"I had read other reviews and was excited to order and recieve my Bengoo. Recently my neighbors have been having parties and playing music loud enough you could feel it shake the walls, so I was very eager to see the noise cancellation come into action as I could relax while I immerse myself in my game. Sadly it made no difference compared to my old headphones. I could still identify whatever song they play through the Bengoo while playing games. If you have an average pair of noise-cancellation headphones, you may want to seek a premium brand of headphone. Though, if you are seeking a cheap option, this is not a bad option for first-timers/budget",2022,04
Sound went out after 3 uses,2022,04
"My son loves these, he uses them with his computer and PlayStation.",2022,04
"Cheap plastic feel. Right out the box the audio would cut out just from moving the wire (even the most basic movement caused it to short out). Horrible sound quality when it did work, even at the highest level it was barely audible. I got the headset because of the high ratings, but looking at the lower scores it would seem that my issue isn't an isolated occurrence .",2022,04
Very nice headphone. Perfect for gaming,2022,04
I bought this item and it was echoing so I got it replaced. Now with my replaced heaphone I can only hear out of the right side. Terrible do notRecommend buying!!,2022,04
Thank you,2022,04
"It has endured for over a year or so with no complaints or problems I don't cause from my end. Haven't used the microphone due to laziness, lack of need, and computer issues so can't review that part.",2022,04
I like it,2021,09
"I must admit I bought these due to price.  I have found they do not cancel exterior noise at all, as I am able to hear the TV and conversations very easily while wearing the headset.  I would also note that after 10 minutes or so, they tend to be painful and I am forced to remove them.",2022,04
"It works like it should. Originally I thought it was broken and the seller reached out and fully refunded me, but it turns out it was user error!",2022,04
"Things I buy, I consider upgrading at some point, or how could this be better? With these headphones I’ve never once thought, gawd I need a better headset. Good bass, really good treble. Only thing in my setup that isn’t upgraded because it doesn’t need to be. 10/10 would recommend.",2022,04
My son wanted these.  I do hear a loud buzzing when the volume it up high.,2022,04
Great product almost had it for a year now great for the price,2022,04
These are awesome for how much they cost. My only complaint is they get uncomfortable on the ears after playing for more than an hour because the padding is superb. But they're awesome for the price so definitely worth it.,2022,04
Bought them for the grand kids for Christmas they absolutely love them. They use them on their phones on the tablets and also gaming me quality is great.,2022,03
for the prices they are great,2022,03
My daughter is a gamer.  For her ninth birthday she asked for this headset.  It more than exceeded my expection and the quiality of the sound uf A+.  I am most definintely a fan of this headset.,2022,03
Work really well for normal use with gaming. Actually sound about as good as other headphones I have with sound canceling turned off. The mic is actually really good and clear. Long cord. Not very many complaints except maybe the ear pads might be a tad but more comfortable but what you pay for them is a really good price.,2022,03
Works well,2022,03
This product is worth the costs.  We have been using this headset frequently for over a year and it has performed without any concerns.,2022,03
They are really good headset for the price. I searched for awhile and they are probably the best headset at this price point on amazon without skimping on quality. Got these for my sister on xmas amd she uses them all the time.,2022,03
"cable length isnt bad and audio is decent, dont recommend it for the microphone since i have to essentially put it in my mouth for it to work but a solid pair of headphones for the price",2022,03
Broke after 4 months. We were satisfied untill they broke.,2022,03
Thay sound great,2022,03
My mic does not work and barely any info on how to fix and no help from support,2022,03
Did not work straight out the box.,2022,03
Great sound and the Mike is awesome. Use it for streaming and it doesn’t wonderful.,2022,03
These headphones work perfectly. I have to tell at my kid so that he can notice me lol. So the noise cancelation works. And I don't have to tell him to turn his gear down because we can't hear it blasting away. These were the perfecto gift for that gamer in your house.,2022,03
My son sats the are awesome and they have lasted longer then other headphones i have purchased for him. Great price! 👍,2022,03
"They're good headphones. However, the headphone jack constantly pops out, and I've had to coat it in an adhesive to ensure it didn't. It annoys me very much, especially when I'm gaming.",2022,03
Bought it for my granddaughter just because she was very happy with it and arrived on time and undamaged would recommend to friend or family member,2022,03
"Received headset, plugged it in, light came on, but no sound would come through the ear pieces and mic didn't work either, basically just bought a light to wear on my head for $40, completely useless! Gave 2 stars because atleast the light worked and the headset looks nice, other then that it's junk.Update, was contacted by company and sent a new headset which works perfect so gave 5 star review now because headset has good sound quality, it's light weight and comfortable to wear for hours at a time. Also added bonus is that the cord is a decent length so it doesn't limit you on movement.",2022,03
"I took a chance and bought this headset cause of the many good reviews but it’s by far the worst headset I ever gamed with. Walmart 10$ headset was better then this crap. It hurts my ears, there’s only sound from the left side the right doesn’t have any sound at all and it’s extremely loud and staticky and if I lower volume to try to hear people better in The game it just goes mute.",2022,03
This headset out performs those more expensive headsets on here. I am so impressed how good they perform. That's what I call bang for your buck!!!,2022,03
"Very good considering it’s pretty cheap. Had mine for almost 4 years, and i’m just now having to buy another. Definitely recommend. Sound is clear and microphone is pretty good as well.",2022,03
My son loves it!,2022,03
"Had a slight hiccup with the product, but the kind and generous customer service fixed my issues swiftly.  All and all great headset my son loves it.",2022,03
Our kids love it! They can play each other in a game on our ps4 and ps5 game systems. They also love it for their kindles and school devices.,2022,03
This was a gift for my 14yo son n he absolutely loves it,2022,03
"I am just a low key kinda gamer. I don't have a lot of money, or a fancy set up- just a fan for my gaming laptop and these! they match which is really cool. (see photo)I have no complaints- I asked a guy on roblox VC how I sounded on a scale from 1-10 and he said a 9.if you are like me or have kids who also play games similar to me (such as roblox or elite dangerous or just have general steam/discord needs) then I would recommend this headset. Although its plastic it doesn't feel low quality or cheap. I feels well made and sturdy, I've dropped this think like 10 times already and also stepped on and by mistake yanked on the cord- it's still working great though. also the volume control and mic on and off buttons all work fine.if you don't game for a living, but want something that finally isnt junk, but aren't rich- this in my opinion is your solution.",2022,03
I bought these for my husband so that he can play his video games but I can still be in the same room without hearing all that crazy noise I highly recommend,2022,03
Head phones worked as promised.  They look great during ZOOM calls.  Adds a little flair to business meetings.,2022,03
"New Review:The company contacted me directly via email. They offered to replace my headset due to the issues on the previous one. I received the new one a few weeks ago, but finally got the chance to try it. New headset works very good. Sound quality is better. I would recommend it.Previous review:The only issue I have with it is the sound quality. I have to turn up the volume all the way to be able to get decent sound. Noise cancellation is good. I might get them replaced for something else.",2022,03
"Bought these after my kids broke my sony gold headset. While these do not have as great features at the gold headsets as don’t offer as well sound quality and noise cancellation while also being wireless, I expected a step down in quality as I was purchasing something to bare the damage they might face until my kids (and cats) could Learn to mind others things. While they are a step down, I’m surprised at how much I like them. I like the volume control on the cord rather than the headset so I can see if It if I need to and while not as great, they do have some noise cancellation. There isn’t much base nor any surround sound features but for this price point I think that would be asking for too much. Overall I’m happy with them and until I feel the need to get a more expensive pair, these will be what I use. I will definitely hold onto them as backup pair if I ever do upgrade as well.",2022,03
"Great sound, completely blacks out other noise!",2022,03
only complaint is USB cord was too short to plug into my computer for the lights on the headphone. My laptop had an outlet on the left side and attached cord would not reach.,2022,03
"After removing the new headphones from package we noticed a defective area in the wire. Fortunately  the headphones are working properly. Just hope it doesn't continue to unwind. My 11yr son really likes it for gaming and says its great sound quality,, Comfortable, cool and stylish. However it does slide off his head and he has to keep readjusting but that doesn't seem to bother him. Gave it 4 stars due to defect.",2022,03
"I liked everything about it but the jack. The braided cord separates from the plug pretty easy. So if u buy maybe reinforce it in advance. Otherwise great sound, lightweight, comfy and worth the buy",2022,03
My grandson loves the light up feature on the headphones. Great present for him.,2022,03
sounds great,2022,03
I dislike the product because the product doesn't work well supposed to use for gaming really it was a waste of money,2022,03
These are a good quality for those who want something in this price range!,2022,03
Sound quality is amazing and as my wife can concur they most certainly are some of the best noise cancellation headphones I’ve ever used.,2022,03
"Overall, it is a good product. But the only thing I don't like is the ear cup. It's kind of small. It doesn't cover my ear completely!",2022,03
do they cancel out background noise? not really. but they are amazing headphones for the price. just bought another one for my brother and i have informed others to buy as well!!,2022,03
My grandsons love their new headsets.I would buy them again.,2022,03
My son uses this for playing Xbox games and he loves it,2022,03
I am updating my review of this headset.  I received an updated G9000 Gaming Headset from the vendor. The issues that I had had have been corrected with the new headset. I am extremely pleased with my new product.  The company has done an outstanding job to solve my initial issue.Please ignore my previous review that is below:One of the issues is that the headphones were sized for a young kid and expanding them did not help that much. The sound quality was fine but noise cancellation was not adequate.,2022,03
amazing headset for the money. Great quality.,2022,03
These just died. No help with replacing them. They are only 6 months old! DO NOT BUY!,2022,03
Purchased these headphones and after a month the sound started going in and out because the wire shorted. They worked fine before that but you get what you pay forUpdate:Bengoo reached out and made things right by sending me a new headset.  So far this one is working fine. And I appreciate their integrityUpdate 2:The new headset that was sent to me shorted again.  The audio keeps going in and out. I was hoping this was just a fluke but this products wire is just not good,2022,03
Kiddo loved these for his PC games (he is 13) it was a great deal and got great reviews. Bought these on 2-19-22. A month later (3-22-22)and only one ear piece works and the mic doesn’t work anymore either. I can’t even return them now because the return window closed literally 3 days ago. Not impressed.,2022,03
"This was a great purchase! He says they are everything he hoped for, SCORE!!!",2022,03
"I bought this back in January to use it for work. Initially worked perfect. After about two weeks the speaker was not audible. I tried all necessay adjustments, volume on both my devices: computer and phone but unsuccessfull. No one could hear me talk. I cant return because its past return date .  However as fas as sound listening is concerned it is good. May be I got a substandard product as I see good reviews",2022,03
Great for gaming,2022,03
Great headphones.,2022,03
"sound quality is like every headset but the mic js sounds so bad and quiet, even if the volume is literally all the way up.",2022,03
"Not at all good. Sound is tinny, no bass. Can see why ratings were so low. Thought that 85000 reviewers meant it was good, but they're not. Pass.",2022,03
"This is specifically for the Green and Black Bengoo G9000 professional gaming headset.The quality of this headset for the price is near unbeatable. Headset feels very durable/kid proof. It’s made of ABS plastic with metal inserts on the adjustable band. The ear cushions on these are pleather pillow cushions and they are extremely comfortable. I have an absolutely huge head, and these fit just right. The ear cups fit over my ears entirely and they do a decent job of blocking out ambient sound.The headset is very light weight, making it very comfortable to use for long play sessions. I had no ear or head pain from wearing these for extended periods of time.The integrated volume control and mute switch work very well. The cord is extra long (8ft) and it’s braided the entire way. This cord feels pretty premium and even has a Velcro cord wrap on it.It comes with a PC Splitter just in case you have a setup like that. The USB only powers the LED lights, and they are very green. Therefore, the USB does not have to be plugged in, but is a nice touch if you’re into that sort of thing. Personally I really like the lights and think they are nice, but I don’t use them every time either.Microphone quality is very good and the noise canceling system seems to work extremely well on it. Only time echo was noticed was when volume was at 100% and even then, it was not bad at all. I went through numerous $70-$100 headsets in the last three weeks trying to find a microphone that didn’t echo all my friends’ voices back at the slightest sound of speech. Seriously, it was pathetic how garbage the microphones are on the expensive Hyper X and Nacon Rig headsets.Sound quality is superb for the price point. These are pretty bass heavy if you like that sort of thing. Very reminiscent of Skullcandy sound quality. I like this type of sound myself, because in a shooter you literally feel the bass with this headset. Highs are also good if not a little less pronounced, and I had no problem hearing footsteps in shooters. In games like fortnite that’s exactly what you want.These also sound very well with directional 3D audio like Dolby Atmos. So I definitely recommend these for surround sound gaming as well.My one minor complaint is that the cord for the USB is not long enough and it did not come with an extender. That’s a small price to pay though considering everything else is so good about these headphones.I’m now own multiple Bengoo products. This is a brand I trust in. Not only are they a quality brand, but their customer service is absolutely excellent. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy this brand for any of your audio needs.",2022,03
ITS PERFECT FOR GIFTS,2022,03
My son loves the headset he enjoys  how it works.,2022,03
Excelente,2022,03
I ordered for both girls they seem to like worth the price,2022,03
Did not work at all. Cheaply made and very disappointed,2022,03
"i loved the volume and the length of the cord. my only problem is that the mic isn't noise cancelling and a lot randoms end up muting me when i forget to adjust my microphone level. If you enjoy ear raping people, then buy it.",2022,03
Dislike,2022,03
All 3 of my kids got these for their various electronics and no complaints... Great price... Nice design...,2022,03
Loved these so much I bought another one! They’re great! Theyre nice and big with a long cord so no tugging or accidentally pulling the cord out. The sound quality is great you’re able to hear even the smallest sounds on the game. Definitely recommend!,2022,03
"Excellent gaming headset for my gamer!  Works well on the XBox One gaming console.  Customer service was exceptional!  Bought as a gift and so far, nothing but delight from my gamer!  Thank you Bango for making my purchase worth my while!",2022,03
I like the headset works good good for gaming easy only issue is the padding is a little thin on the ears so after a couple hours and starts hurting a bit,2022,03
"I literally just received it, it would be nice to have the opportunity to at least unbox it before you ask for a rating sheesh",2022,03
The only thing is the light won't come on endless you have them plugged into the Xbox and the cord is so short I can't use them I would love t have my lights,2022,03
I bought this for my son’s birthday Feb 17th. Less then a month of using it they are broke. I can’t return. Waste of money. Save your money and put it towards better quality.,2022,03
It's a very cheap headset. If you're just looking for something that'll just get the job done this works. It's not bad or terrible just cheap. Although after wearing the headset for a while my ears started to hurt but that might've been a personal issue,2022,03
Very good head set not very good noise cancellation and I don’t like that the lights have there own plug,2022,03
"They are your typical average gaming headset, so they work well and are worth the money paid for them. My only complaint is that the microphone is not very adjustable and I have to speak very loudly for people to hear me sometimes.",2022,03
Nothing wrong with this honestly,2022,03
"I used every way possible, no sound, no anything.",2022,03
All i was lookin 4,2022,03
They worked great for the time that they did but just a little over a month after having them the mic stopped working. Very disappointing to say the least and I can’t even return them.,2022,03
For gaming works great,2022,03
"This is the second one of these we purchased. Lasted 2 years of daily use! The cord is wearing out, effecting the sound, where it plugs in.",2022,03
Doesn’t work for ps5 ..head phones will work not the mic..,2021,09
There is No lighting up of the headset unless a very short cord is in the USB @ same time as the other that is plugged into the gaming unit. That’s falsely advertised. It sounds good and works good but NO LIGHTS AT ALL & that’s mainly why I picked this one. Bummer.,2022,03
It was very good!! I got it for my nephew for his birthday !! And he loves it !,2022,03
Sound is clear. And definitely cuts down the noise of my 3 youngens running around.lol exactly as described.,2022,03
My great granddaughter likes them,2022,03
Been using for a while and are pretty alright.,2022,03
It stopped working after 4 weeks,2022,03
Works great the cord is longer than I would have liked. Also not a fan that the lights need a USB port,2022,03
Overall I was satisfied with this product.,2022,03
"I’m just tryna find out how to turn the led light on, but it’s a great set overall.",2022,03
Great Product!,2022,03
"Good overall product for the money. I have had these headphones for one year now, and they still work great. The sound is good, and the noise cancellation works pretty well. They are mostly used with A Nintendo switch lite, and they even work well with that! Happy with the product, and would buy again.",2022,03
Like. Playing on my ps4,2022,03
My boyfriend literally had to scream for people to hear him,2022,03
"This is a piece of garbage. It's uncomfortable with small ear muffs that make it a pain to wear. The sound quality is subpar, and the mic is SO quiet. I'm unable to be heard at all. I even tested with my old mic, and the difference is night and day. Even checked my Windows settings and the mic was all the way up. I was absolutely baffled because all of the reviews here make this seem like a halfway decent product, but I can assure you, buying this is the single best way to waste money. This is a hunk of garbage.",2022,03
My Grandson lives then. He can play his game for hours nonstop.,2022,03
Looks and works amazing !!I use it for Xbox and the sound quality is very very good especially for the price and also looks very pretty!,2022,03
It’s really good for gaming and how it cancels some of the noise outside.,2022,03
"I’ll be honest at such a low price I didn’t have big expectations. I was ready to try them and send them back if I didn’t like them.Positives: the sound quality is actually really good, and it does block out ambient noise. They are comfortable, I don’t think they are too heavy, some of the wireless headphones hurt after awhile, one reason I choose wired.Negatives: it had a volume control, and although nice to have it adds weight to the cord, so I have to make sure I put the volume control in my lap, or else it pulls on the headphones, and it’s heavy. The mic only moves up and down, which I wish it could move away or towards your mouth too.Overall, for the price, these are nice.",2022,03
"The colors are dang cool.. It doesn't work with the Xbox One S series. Not w/ an adapter. I wrote the seller and they took this very seriously and addressed my issues ASAP! Thank you so much. Sadly,  it just was not compatible with my Xbox One. I'm giving them 4 stars 🌟 bc of the awesome customer service! I would buy from them again, no problem. Thank you 😊",2022,03
I bought this headset as a replacement for work. It works very well for what I need it for.,2022,03
My son has been using since Xmas. Great sound and comfortable. He will be going wireless on the next pair. Good starter headphones. Durable and has not broke,2022,03
I bought 2 pairs .  One broke within one day microphone broke off and the other set just sucks,2022,02
"Stopped working after 4 months. Sound constantly goes in and out but was solid for the 1st 4 months. Also, Very long 7-8 inch wire which is very unnecessary and gets in the way. $25 bucks for a reason",2022,02
Skip past every comment besides this one. Best headset ever 100/10 quality lmfao 😂😂😂 you see the taped cig box on the mic that's the only way people can hear you threw the headset I only figured this out cause I was joking around about the POS with my fiancee and cuffed my hand around my mouth and the mic and it worked well cig pack is almost the right size but still works have to funnel all noise to it noise cancelation golden even the gamers voice is cancelled out unless you do this,2022,02
great backup headsets,2022,02
This headset has very good sound quality fits nicely on head and comfortable. The mic pickup isn't too sensitive and of course it looks cool how it lights up.,2022,02
Works as described.,2022,02
"*UPDATE* After I left the below negative review the company contacted me and offered me $30 to remove it. I would assume that several reviewers have taken them up on this offer and have removed negative reviews. So not only is the product junk, but the company has shady business practices. Skip it, go somewhere else.This is the second pair I bought for my son. I guess I didn't learn my lesson the first time. First one worked for two months, this one worked for less than two weeks. It's $20ish for a reason. Don't waste your time.",2022,02
USB plug is short and doesn't reach most ports.if you have the audio jack plugged as well.,2022,02
It didn’t come with wireless capabilities without buying a few more attachments that were just as expensive as the headset. Had to return. But to use as a plug in- totally fine,2022,02
"Sounds great, mic came broken",2021,09
It looks all fancy and awesome. I got it for my daughter. She loves the looks. It not noise cancellation. Awesome for big heads and not for petite young kids.,2022,02
I had an issue with my product but the sellers made it right immediately.  I would buy it again,2022,02
He has had these headphones for a year now and they still work great,2022,02
"This is probably the single most frustrating headset I have ever dealt with.  The 3.5mm jack fits loosely in a Dell workstation, it is not wired correctly (does not work in a combo headset/mic jack on the same workstation).  The USB connection is purely to power the LEDs.I ended up replacing with a cheaper headset from a reputable manufacturer and all of the issues ceased.",2022,02
These headphones are very high quality for a low price. Very sturdy and don't feel cheap. They hold onto your head very snug and don't slip like alot of other headsets. The sound quality is better than some high end headsets I've used and they cancel noise outside of the headset very well. The cord is also very long so you're not restricted on how much you can move with them on as it is a wired headset ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,2022,02
"Headset randomly stopped working one day. I was in the middle of a game and all of my audio got cut. Nothing I could do to fix it. Cheap quality headset, do NOT buy.",2022,02
 Love the:ColorStyleSizeEtc.Was a gift for my boo.He have a ps4,2022,02
"One ear doesn’t even work. Waste of money. I was excited because my previous headphones broke but was extremely disappointed when the audio to the one side didn’t even work. Plus, they’re extremely uncomfortable if you wear glasses.",2022,02
Talking side did not work,2022,02
Got this for my laptop cause it legit says it works for them and didn't work at all. Waste of money!!,2022,02
Works amazing for my son. No complaints. This was our 2nd purchase of these. He now has one for each game system.,2022,02
Got these for my son for the PlayStation 4. They work perfectly and definitely are noise canceling he can’t hear me when I call him which is semi annoying lol.,2022,02
"This headset died after less than a month of regular use  no loud music, only used for gaming & voice chat - they just randomly died. Total junk! Save your money & buy something else!",2022,02
The quality is a not bad  the sound is decent,2022,02
My son says there good,2022,02
"First set was ordered for Xmas, didn’t work had to order new pair… SO FAR SO GOOD WITH THE NEW HEAD SET",2022,02
"This was a gift for my kidos birthday, its 1st use was on January 24th its mic died on February 20th... Was great until it died had to go back to the cheap ear buds, I am 20 days past the return go figure... Thanks for turning my money into garbage so fast!",2022,02
This head feels good and not all bad nut my one problem is that the mic not working for some reason it just won't work i tried it on all my devices and it just won't work.,2022,02
Very nice for the price,2022,02
Love it,2022,02
"These headphones come in a very nice durable box, you really feel like they made it you safely. The headphones themselves feel very nice and strong but still comfortable they fit on my adult head and my ear sit comfortably even with my piercings in. The lights aren't too bright and overwhelming but just right. I was surprised by the sound quality, I can hang these on my neck and still hear my game or music. They hook up very easy and so far they seem like they will last, I definitely recommend them so far",2022,02
These worked awesome for gaming supper happy! Noise canceling is perfect and love the color! And comfortable worth the money for some cheaper headphones,2022,02
Yes the quality is great my son can't stay off it,2022,02
Only problem i am haveing is the end that plugs in to the controller The Wire is coming loose,2022,02
i  received  the  item  but  did not  approve  of it there not  worth  $27 81 and  i  still  didnt get my moineyies back,2022,02
My son uses these for gaming on his switch and listening to music on his tablet. His friends can hear him and he can hear them clearly.,2022,02
"These headphones are not noise canceling, not even a little bit, the sound feels off most of the time, and it is also uncomfortable. .",2022,02
I’m using these headphones with my laptop and the sound quality is very good.,2022,02
Everything works great except for the mic.  The mic wont transmit at all.  The customer service however contacted me shortly and refunded me for my purchase as well as apologized.  I know that sometimes issues happen and its the way that companies fix things that make a big difference.  They did right by me and i salute themfor that. I will definately do business with them again.,2022,02
"I like the looks, feel and sounds of these headphones. The cable could be longer and a longer cable separation of the input USB and the ear jack would be an improvement. The volume control is mispositioned for a tall user as it gets in the way and is heavy on the cord. Otherwise these things are great and I do highly  recommend them.",2022,02
Received broken- couldn’t hear out of both sides. Returned,2022,02
My son loves it,2022,02
"The audio coming in is muffled and the headphones feel all around cheap (made of not flexible plastic),however if you have no choice they are functional.",2022,02
Grandson say they work good,2022,02
Good for music and gaming it drowns out everything around you I love it,2022,02
"Used these headphones while playing on the ps4. I did a stream to test out how I'd sound to other. It was basically at a whisper even when I was raising my voice. Same problem when I tested the mic using my phone. The sound output is also low. I raised my ps4 headphone volume and it wasn't any louder then the headphones I was using before, at a lower volume. The wheel didn't help in either of these situations.",2022,02
I found them to be kind of junky,2022,02
My grandson uses these headphones for gaming and his father uses them on business calls to be hands-free. Good quality. Sturdy. Good sound.,2022,02
They show in pics like they are lit.  Not with a Nintendo switch.  Has a separate port to plug in which required me to add a cord with adapter. Super annoying. Would not have purchased.,2022,02
"Don't buy this. Typical Amazon trash. Works fine for two days, then will start developing shorts. Mic and right ear gave out after no time at all.",2022,02
"Ordered these in October and the left ear stereo is now gone. I've had other headphones that have lasted longer then this.Will not be purchasing these again.UPDATE: company got ahold of me, sent a brand new set.  I'm gonna change the score based on the customer service alone, but we will see how long these lasts. Will update the review accordingly.If you do get them, get a warranty. You'll need it before long.",2022,02
Bought for my husband! As far as he has told me and I can tell he like them a lot!! He uses them for Xbox gaming and we bought them in a pinch because our youngest broke his and he has like them so far! Noise canceling works pretty well if you ask me I have to either go up to him and tap him or yell super loud for him to hear me!!!,2022,02
"The sound is crystal clear and the wire prevents easy entanglement but I’ve noticed something after a couple of weeks of use. The ear pieces aren’t comfortable for adults due to them being too small. And what’s even worse is that I wear glasses and it makes it even more uncomfortable for me and even making it difficult to focus during gaming. I have to constantly try to move them around just for it to be bearable in comfort. So warning, not recommended with glasses and/or adults.",2022,02
It didn’t work at all with my PlayStation 4,2022,02
My son loves them,2022,02
"UPDATE: Seller realized I left a 1-star review and is now spamming me with gift card bribes to remove it. If you are wondering how a product with so many bad reviews somehow has over a 4-star rating, it's because they bribe buyers with gift cards to delete bad reviews or change them to 4+ stars.Original review:I purchased a BENGOO G9000, but the headset came in a Butfulake GH-1 box (pics attached).No user manual included. My mousepad came with more troubleshooting instructions!For some reason a gaming headset needed both a USB plug and an audio jack (good ones only need USB).My Windows 10 PC didn't recognize the USB when plugged in (all other USB headsets in my household work fine with the same PC). The blue ear lights go on, but no audio or microphone available.Apparently you have to use the audio jack to make the sound work, but still no working microphone with a non-functioning USB plug.Someone clearly tried to pass off their broken leftovers as ""new"". No idea how this seller and product became an ""Amazon Choice"" with strong customer ratings. Very scammy experience. Serves me right for trying to go cheap on electronics. I already started the return process.",2022,02
it was great and on time delivered!,2022,02
A gift for my grandson,2022,02
"This was a gift for one of my grandsons, and he uses it with his switch. His brother also has one that he has had for about a year. So I asked them about their experiences.Grandson #1 says he likes the mic and the noise cancellation helps with any surround sound. Overall they are perfect for any device with a circle headphone slot.Grandson #2 says he loves them! They are comfortable and can be adjusted. He likes the mic.They say five stars!!",2022,02
"Not sure what to say except that these are the best headphones I've ever owned. Good quality, sound, and comfort.",2022,02
We had an issue with the first set and the company replaced them.  The set is awesome!!  I would order from this company again!!  Thank you for backing your product!,2022,02
"This Product feels nice, and looks nice. Sound Quality isn't top top tier, but it's got a lot of bang for its buck. It's a great purchase.",2022,02
Amazon had it in the wireless section and it’s not wireless. In fact there are plenty of long wires to annoy you. It’s sound quality is $10 sound quality as well as not being confortable fit and a pain to wear if on for more than 15 minutes.  Easy choice to return and get a new one.  DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,2022,02
Didn’t work,2022,02
I would refer anyone to buy this,2022,02
"Overall great headset, sound is great, built well, lights are bright, has mute toggle switch on wire along with a volume control.I was leery of getting a headset with lights for only $28.06 but these have been the best headset I have ever used. They arrived quickly and the box was in great shape. When I first took them out of the packaging I thought I had ordered the wrong kind because of the audio jack and USB hook up portion but after a little bit of examination I realized the USB was for the lights. I tested them on my phone first and oh my gods, the audio is so crisp and clear. I play Call of Duty: Vanguard with these and can hear footsteps from across the map, however I still die due to my bad aim. lol They work great on computers as well, on max volume I can hear them in my hallway when they are in my bedroom.",2022,02
You get what you pay for what did I expect. Just save and buy an actual headset like from Corsair or some turtle beaches are better than these.,2022,01
Surprisingly great headset for a great price. Nice surprise!,2022,01
"I got these for my fiance' cause he wanted/needed a new headset. Obviously, he pick these cause he liked the color. Beside the color looking nice the quality of sound is very poor.",2022,01
So far they work perfect im hapoy for the price,2022,01
"Day 1 - Used it on my gaming pc. Huge issues. This headset by default will default itself to the speakers/microphone on your pc/laptop under the default settings making it very hard to make games and discord to detect the headset, and ultimately cuck you're stream setting abilities. After 3 hours of fiddling with settings, I finally was able to make it work correctly.Day 2 - Doesn't work at all now. Microphone works but the headset now doesn't produce any sound. And yes I did make sure my volume was turned all the way up through the hardware and software sides.I understand that I chose a cheap product to fulfill my needs of a headset but don't out right sell a faulty and useless product.Waste of time and money.",2022,01
"Just arrived and my son was so excited. We plug it into the Sony ps4 controller (not off-brand) and nobody can hear him chat in Fortnight. My husband plugged it into his phone and the microphone worked. Why not the PS4? That’s what we bought it for, so it’s basically useless for our needs.",2022,01
Bought for my son for Christmas and he loves them.  They are his favorite color and they shine bright.  He can really hear his friends well when he uses them.,2022,01
For the price it’s good to use for gaming with other players over the ps4 system,2022,01
I just got these 30 mins ago and tried them.First off it doesn’t light up unless you plug both ends into a port which means console players won’t get the light up. Second it’s just all around horrible with its sound. Thee most quiet whisper like sound. I bought it on the grounds of the high rating and good reviews but it didn’t come close to standards. I don’t know if this is just defective or what but this ain’t it and I am quite disappointed in the money I just gave to a company that couldn’t even hold standard for gaming.,2022,01
"Is came with one side of the headset not working then when speaking into the mic the other party couldn’t hear what was being said. I recommend maybe a different one, if this worked for you great but on my end it didn’t. The box came a little beat up looking too also very light weight feel like they would have broke easily. Sent it back for a refund.",2022,01
It is a very straightforward product. It has a mic and the light features are cool to look at and I just plug n play. No complaints about it so far.,2022,01
Stay away,2022,01
Great quality sound! Comfortable and durable,2022,01
Description of this item list that it has LED lights. THERE ARE NO LIGHTS!,2022,01
Literally had this for less than 2 months and suddenly I can't hear anything.,2022,01
The sounds is good on them,2022,01
Mute button does not work,2022,01
Product doesn’t work,2022,01
"1st off, this product advertises as if there are lights on it....there aren't. Its just a sticker that doesn't have any LED function. Very misleading.2nd, the headset is very poorly made. The earpieces barely fit my 3 year old. They are far too small to fit an adults ears.3rd, the sound quality is subpar. Takes a lot of adjustment and you'd get better quality from an Xbox 360 default headset.Do NOT buy this.",2022,01
Got these today and I’m not sure if I should even use them specially after learning most it’s reviews are fake. I bought a new console along side these and I’m not going to risk losing a new controller if the adapter decides to break off inside it like some reviewers say. The first red flag for me was definitely the packaging. it was packed in a large box with bubble wrap and just felt unofficial. There was also wear on the ear pieces indicating prior use. And the worst part is you don’t even have to use them in game to tell the mic is defective as it won’t even reach the front of you’re face. The cord as well as volume slider are a bit obnoxious in size. And the product overall feels like a fragile plastic off brand.I did test them on my switch and the sound was surprisingly good. I noticed background static at first which a lot of people mentioned but it wasn’t terrible or even noticeable at times.I’ll probably stash these away for a backup pair and just buy a name brand pair for the same or even better price. And if you are also looking for a solid gaming headset then please help yourself and look away from these.,2022,01
"Loved the headset, incredible sound",2022,01
Great headphones,2022,01
"So I just got these today and was excited. However, upon setting them up, I noticed that the ""light up"" function is only usable when hooking up the attached usb to the port on my ps5. Stupidly enough, there isn't enough cable split to also connect the headphones to your controller in order to use the headphones for its sole purpose. It's either they light up on the damn counter and look cute OR you talk to friends while playing online but there is no both so can you say....COMPLETE DESIGN FLAW, FALSE ADVERTISEMENT, AND BOTTOM LINE....THIS COMPANY NEEDS TO CLOSE SHOP AND GO FLIP BURGERS!!!!!",2022,01
"This works well for my son’s Xbox Series. He likes it! I would have given 5 stars if the USB cord that is to inserted into the port on the Xbox was longer. Because that cord is so short, he’s not able to experience the blue LED while playing.",2022,01
Not bad,2022,01
"Excellent item, excellent customer service",2022,01
"I bought 2 of these, one stopped working 3 months in and the other stopped 8 months in. Of course, it's too late to get replacements.",2022,01
Unfortunately our product broke but BENGOO reached out to us and was willing to issue us a full refund for our troubles.,2022,01
You get what you pay for. Weak mic requires manual adjusting through computer. Sensitivity is low so you may have to raise it or scream into the mic.,2022,01
"I recently tried to go back to an old pair of headphones, and found them to be lacking. So I opted to buy a second pair of these since I had used them before and enjoyed them. After a side by side comparison, these headphones are more comfortable, have a much higher audio quality, and overall feel like they have a better build quality than other headphones I've used. If you're looking for a great product that looks good, and for a lower price than high end ones, buy these! You certainly won't regret it!",2022,01
"I love this and it works great! You can adjust the sound and mute your mic very easily! The only down side is that you need a usb port to make it light up. It really does not matter if it lighted up or not, but i play on ps4 and only have a remote. I don’t have a pc to plug the usb into to make it light up. but overall i love it!",2022,01
"Had a few issues but customer service was awesome!! Problem was resolved immediately. Overall, I would buy headset again.",2022,01
The cord is stupid. It's like its backwards. Only way to use the lights is plug the cord in and the cord for the lighst is literally a foot long. That means you are a foot in front of the tv when you play a game. Ridiculous,2022,01
This pair of headphones has worked really well for me. I plan on buying another pair because my current pair has gotten damaged due to my putting the pair on uneven surfaces and the wires have been tugged on too much. I knocked the head phones down on accident several times. I walked while wearing these head phones and I dropped my phone. The cord itself got accidentally tugged and unplugged from my phone. I won't be using these headphones outside my room anymore. Also my room is well enough organized now that I shouldn't end up knocking them over on accident anymore.,2022,01
The quality is worth the product!!,2022,01
Got this for my son's birthday. He loves it!,2022,01
"This headset came with the microphone not even working! It wouldn't show up on my computer!! It's either the headset is broke, or the cord is! And on top of that, You can hear what's going on in the headset even if you're not the one wearing it! Very disappointed.",2022,01
"Used these for gaming on my PC. Everyone I was playing with told me there was consistent background static every time I cued my mic. I tried several different ways to correct the static from setting up the headset on the PC and updating drivers and the issue persisted. The overall features of the headset were good, but the static issue won't work for me. I returned these and will be purchasing a different brand.",2022,01
Love them my son uses the heck out of them no complains yet . And he will let you know.,2022,01
My kid loves it,2022,01
My child love these and uses them every day. I will definitely buy again. Priced right,2022,01
I bought these for my 6 year old daughter. She has a place to put them away safely and is great with taking care of her stuff. Today she went to plug these into her tablet (4th use) and the headphone plug pulled out of the cord. Very disappointed in the quality,2022,01
The cord is the same length of my height but overall it’s a great headset. On the cord is a Velcro strip and you can tie your cord up so it’s not as long but overall great headset,2022,01
My last headset lasted me 3 years and finally died on me. I orded this one thinking it looked good. First off the mic isnt curvable to so i cant put it closer to my face and its to far. So now its half way on my ear so i can move it closer to my mouth. My friends can still barely hear me when im not speaking loudly and this is a problem since i have a 1 year old that sleeps near me. Ive also listened to myself and i sound like im inside of a can. The only postive i could find is that its really comfy and the sound quality is ok. Ill be sending this back tomorrow and ordering another rig headset since they clearly understand whats needed to make a good gaming headset.,2022,01
"Imagine you are in a game of League of Legends, you are 19-0-0 in the first 7 minutes. You are carrying everyone. You run top, Nasus scores a kill. You are now 19-1-0. The team is up in kills, you have just got the first tower. Rift is up, it's yours. Easy win.Now imagine the same game. Vayne goes AFK mid team fight, you get aced. Vayne returns and tells everyone that they are trash and throws up a forfeit vote. 1-4. No big deal.The time is now 16 minutes and it's time for a dragon fight. You are there, the enemy jungle is warded, river is warded, and you have contributed your 75 gold Control Ward to the occasion. It's time for the second team fight. The enemy jungle jumps your ADC, Nasus is there to wither and assist. In the mean time your support, Alistar, W / Q combos Dragon. You are in their back line doing work, but there is too much crowd control. You die, 19-2-1. Your team splits up and falls apart. Aced.FF Vote comes in. 3-2.Anyways, these headsets can stand up to the toughest walls in the business. New drywall? No issue. Still going. A wooden aquarium stand? Pfft. Oh, a single pane window? Better order a new window. These things are stout.With all the money you've saved on replacement headsets, you can now afford that therapist everyone has been telling you to get.",2022,01
"It was a little loose for my small head, but other than that no problems with the mic or sound quality.",2022,01
Has a extra USB cable by audio cable.  Helps it work better.. and for all the lights all over them.  Cord is long.  Over all kid is satisifirm3d until he breaks them like the previous 6 he has already.,2022,01
I like the sound,2022,01
Spend a little more a get a real pair,2021,09
"My son like this for playing online games on his Xbox had a previous turtle headset that he loved but that had gotten damage after long use. This item was confusing to use there’s a separate USB cord plug adapter that can be plugged in if you’re using it on a laptop or computer that will also make the unit light up but the lights only work if the USB cord is plugged in. During play sound often times would not work and microphone would intermittently cut in and out. *** update , now works better after resetting and updating controller for xbox***Volume and on off switchIs bulky and uncomfortable returning product going to buy another turtle",2022,01
"Friend who this was bought for said the headphones had good sound quality from his games he was playing, but the microphone is muffled and you can barely make out what he's saying through voice chat.  Probably ok if you don't care about being heard.  The design looks nice enough.",2022,01
Purchased for Grandson- is a hit.  best part cord is not plastic its braded and cat won't eat the cord.  He is a beginner gamer.,2022,01
I bought it for my boyfriend and his exact words where “the quality is juicy”😂. Meaning it’s was the best choice for him to do his gaming,2022,01
My son is happy with this headset.  Setup easily and sound great.,2022,01
"The sound quality on these is absolutely terrible for gaming. I tried them with music as well, also terrible. The volume wheel is upside down/backwards. The mic is worthless and not working properly. The LED lights are worthless for gaming on anything other than a PC. It is one cord with a very small split at the end, one to go into the controller and the other is a USB for the lights to work, but you can't use the lights and play on the PS4 or Xbox at the same time which makes these pretty pointless in that aspect. There is NO noise cancelation, whatsoever! 10 out of 10 would NOT recommend. These look and sound nice when you read the description and reviews, but they are absolute trash. I wouldn't even buy them for my kids.",2022,01
For the price it works fine and is comfortable. I can wear it for hours and it doesn't hurt. I have no idea about  noise cancelling. I'm not an audiophile or anything but it sounds fine to me for my needs. I have asked people on the other end if the mic sounds good and they say they can hear me fine. It is loud enough but I do wish it was able to get even louder for some uses. Rating it 5 stars for filling my needs but 4 stars on the gaming scale because while I can hear footsteps and surround sound I'm sure it must not be as good as a Turtle Beach or something. I've also had it for 1.5 years and no issues. No idea about the lights because I've never plugged that in.,2022,01
"The headset barely fit on my head. After constant adjustment and tweaking, I would have to put a pair of socks on top of my head in order for it to be comfortable and fit.",2022,01
"Cool looking, comfortable & light weight.",2022,01
"I wrote a negative review for this purchase. Company reached out to me and offered a replacement free of charge. While I really appreciate the replacement, I found the new set of headphones had the same issue as the original. Choppy sound is not an ideal way to immerse yourself into a game.I truly appreciate the company's effort, but I can't recommend this product.",2022,01
This thing sucks You have to be to close to the system for comfort I tried it on my ps5 and it doesn’t work at all for ps4 I’m not satisfied especially with how close to have to be to use the head set in the ps5 because in order to turn it on it has to be plugged into the back and the cord to plug into the controller isn’t very long at all so my hands had to be right up in the ps5 and it’s wasn’t comfortable at all,2022,01
Grandkids are enjoying this.,2022,01
Do not buy,2022,01
Perfect sound and quality! Perfect for those who are looking a good headset!,2022,01
"For gaming and even for non-gaming, a gripe I have about this headset is the volume and mic controller. It’s like you have a remote control super glued on the cord and it swings around and knocks up against your arm or chair. The USB cable is also an annoying addition. It’s cool for people who want glowing headsets but for people who don’t need to waste the energy for the lights, it’s an additional cord just hanging off of your laptop or desktop. So the design could definitely be better.As for the noise cancellation, I’m not completely sure what noise cancelling these headsets actually have. I tested the mic and even with the mic all the way up, you have to manually mute yourself using the volume controller; otherwise, people can still hear you but you will seem like you’re far away from the computer.The sound quality is okay. I played games and watched movies with these. While watching shows/movies with just the AUX 3.5 mm jack, I did notice some voice echoing. This isn’t super ideal depending on what you are trying to watch or listen to but some people may enjoy this.The headset does have cushy padding on the ears but it seems pretty small so for those with larger ears, these might be more of on-ear headphones rather than over-ear ones. The cushion does eventually hurt to keep the headset on for an extended period of time but I’m hoping after wearing the cushion down a bit, the comfortability will increase.Overall, the headset is okay. Since I got it on sale, it’s a decent set of headphones.",2022,01
I love it soon as I got it I got on the game and got my first win in free for all oh the led lights only come on when u plug em in ur game so,2022,01
I got these for my boyfriend who plays video games on his PC and he absolutely loves these headphones. They light up a really cool blue when they are on. Very useful for noise cancellation and the quality of sound is amazing.,2022,01
I got this for my daughter and she loves it. They seem to be very durable. She’s very rough on them.,2022,01
" THESE HEADSETS ARE SO FREAKING LOUD AND THEY LOOK AMAZING I love them soooo freaking much, I highly recommend these☺️",2021,12
"The sound is going in and out, I shake the headset and the sound reconnects, then it’s gone for the majority of the time. terrible quality, doesn’t last long at all.",2021,12
**UPDATE**I have finally tried with my PC and I tried on both mine and my husbands and the sound works fine. It’s not very noise canceling but it is nice to hear the base and actually pick up on detail I otherwise wouldn’t have heard without it. The downfall is that the mic won’t work at all. I of course played with the toggle and made sure it wasn’t my computer settings and it still isn’t working. I put in for a return so hopefully this one is defective and the new headset will be better. I’m super bummed because I really wanted to like this headset.I bought this gaming headset specifically for my ps4 and as advertised it states that it is compatible and it is not. I have the original sony PS4 controllers so it’s not even like I’m using off brand. I’ve tried with both of my controllers and nothing. I have not tried with my PC yet. Will update my review once I try it with the PC,2022,01
"I bought these for work. They allow me to blockout most of the conversations in the room and allow me to focus on my own thoughts. Sound quality is good. I listen to music, audiobooks and participate in video conferences.They are not too heavy, I am able to wear them all day with my mask and eyeglasses. They do not apply extra pressure to me ears.",2022,01
They didn’t light up. Disappointing for my little guy.,2022,01
I like the items . I just want them to send me one that actually works. But after 2nd one they don’t have that option. So I guess I’ll buy a different brand that all works not just some.,2022,01
So I got them I have an Xbox series s and the mic wasn’t working but now the sound on them I rant working and idk what’s happening Bc they work on my phone but not my Xbox which don’t make sense they are really great Quality but for me they’re just not working,2022,01
It's not too expensive and it's a good value for the dollar it's not the world's most expensive but with expensive as headsets can be these days this one is a very good middle ground,2022,01
This was a waist of money. It cuts out and I can't even use the USB.,2022,01
"It was a great product while it lasted, one day I woke up and tried to listen to something and it suddenly doesn’t work. Tried all troubleshooting, no success. The cord couldn’t have worn that easily I think, it is usually undisturbed?",2022,01
My 10 ue old lives it,2022,01
I like the sound quality. I use it for a variety of things and it surpassed my expectations. I love it!,2022,01
Great for kids that sit close.,2022,01
"The volume just isn't loud enough, I have it turned all the way up and it's somewhere between a whisper and an inside voice. I'm not impressed at all.",2022,01
Bought for my son to use with his Xbox one only to find out it requires a $45 adaptor to even work.  For the $70 buy a wireless version and end up with a better product.,2022,01
The mic didn’t work,2022,01
"It’s so loud, has a good bass too! I was shocked",2022,01
These are not Xbox 1 compatible!!! Aux and usb jack only 🥲,2022,01
Excelente,2022,01
They have been being used daily since 12/25/21 with no issues. My son is the main user but I’ve “borrowed” them a few times and will be ordering my own shortly!,2022,01
Bought the headphones for my 10 year old and he loves them. He says the sound is clear and the headphones fit his head perfectly. I noticed it has some noise cancellation but he can still hear me when I speak to him. Product works well and is durable. I recommend the buy.,2022,01
Bought these for my son in place of his old Xbox headset. He loves these!,2022,01
This is my first headset and it definitely seems to get the job done. My voice carries through the mic and the sound is great.,2022,01
Not vey good quality,2022,01
My son really loves this headset. He likes that the microphone can bend. We needed help fixing something and the customer service was super helpful and quick to make things right.,2022,01
My son loves them,2022,01
"I got 2 of these for my kids to game with, one on PlayStation and one on Switch.  The sound and noise cancellation seems pretty good, but the headsets won’t light up (which is that they had wanted) because the usb cord to make it light up isn’t long enough to plug into a USB port.",2022,01
I love how the headset has great sound quality. My only gripe is that the leds only work if you plug it into a USB port. But still a very good product for a little bit of money,2022,01
Yes.,2022,01
Didn’t work,2022,01
"Decent low cost headphones for gaming. cool LED's, but I'd much rather put money into better audio quality.",2022,01
"Got this for the mic, was sorely disappointed. Not very comfortable either",2022,01
Bought it for my best friend to go w/ her gaming laptop for Christmas last year. She loved it while it worked but it didn’t even survive til this one.,2022,01
but I wish the mic was on a swivel like Turtle Beach but can’t beat it for price.,2022,01
"Ears are too small, Mute doesn't work, Mic too far from face to pick up clearly",2022,01
Their customer service is fantastic. Absolutely worth it,2022,01
Bonito,2022,01
It gets the job done,2022,01
"Upon receiving these I was so excited to see these lit up while I use them to game on my Xbox. The design of them is bisually appealing upon unboxing. The pink looked a little cheap but I’m sure the other colors with black would have been better. I was saddened to discover that in order for them to light up you have to plug them into a USB, which the splitter for this is very inconveniently placed close to the controller and the cord is extremely short. So that was a big 👎🏼. After being bummed about that I shrugged it off and started gaming with them anyway. I got 5 minutes into my game when sound started breaking up. Another 5 minutes later and they completely stopped working. Tested my old headset just to be sure and the old worked, verifying the headset was junk. Sending back and paying the extra for Turtle Beach!",2022,01
"I use these for gaming, music, videos, schoolwork; pretty much everything spanning both PC and Console experiences. They work great and still work great after almost a year of ownership. The chord is a tad unwieldy with its length and the headphones aren't ideal for noise canceling. Other than that I can't find any issues.",2022,01
My son loves it!,2022,01
Update 2/21/2022:After working with the company - they refunded my faulty headphones. They told me that they have a new manufacturer. Use that information to decide if you are willing to risk it at the price offered. I’m thankful they at least tried to rectify the issue. I hope they don’t keep selling the faulty product.,2022,01
"Stopped working after 5 days. Microphone can't be detected by my Xbox, completely useless!",2022,01
Use it for streaming n I love it,2022,01
The nose cancellation is a plus and works great for what I bought it for. My son loves it for his gaming!,2022,01
These headphones are incredible for their price. The sound quality is great and the noise cancelation is good.,2022,01
"Light up can't be used unless its plugged in, so it can't be used with the gaming controllers",2022,01
Great customer service and a decent headset for the price!,2022,01
Not worth it if you’re looking for something to work longer than a couple of months. My son was able to get a couple of months use out of it before the mic stopped working. Then he would have to hold the cord a certain way for him to hear out of one side. It wasn’t worth doing all that so we tossed it since I was passed the return deadline. I would be very weary of those so called 5 stars reviews.,2022,01
"If you love listening to the irritating sound if static and crackling, then this headset is perfect for you! As soon as I took it out of the box and plugged it in I was met with a wonderful selection of static noises. Don’t even bother buying this product.",2022,01
Bought these for my grandson and he uses them for gaming and school.,2022,01
they are great,2022,01
"Great quality, very happy",2022,01
For gaming & noise cancelation.,2022,01
one thing to know is that you can't have lights on if you are using this for ps4,2022,01
Excelente producto,2022,01
I will never order this product again had to return it and ask for my money back headphones came to me not working at all. So also waiting for my refund,2022,01
"I just bought this, plugged it in, and—nothing. My computer won't detect either the headphones or microphone. Stay away from this product.",2022,01
Excelente,2022,01
My daughter loved the headphones!! Its comfy and lights turn on when connected to PC. Works well with her xbox remote also so its a win all around,2022,01
"So when reading the reviews, I seen a bunch of BAD ones that were posted recently and it honestly scared me. I still got them anyways because I don’t mind for how long they last but the mic is pretty good, for now. I take care of my stuff so I’ll make this mic last for the time I need it for. But it’s a 10/10 from me so far…",2022,01
"Sound is muffled.Lights - vibrant but useless unless you're connecting to a laptop.  For gaming,  the split is too short to connect it to the console  (what makes it light up) and simultaneously to the gaming controller (what makes it useful) . So for gaming, the lights will not be on while wearing the headset.Mic - like so many other complaints, doesn't work.Returning this item.",2022,01
"The product broke, no sound.  Called to trouble shoot was told by Amazon it was sold by third party seller and to contact them.  The only contact is a link to the instruction manual. Very frustrated.  Save your money and do not buy.",2022,01
"You can get sound only on a Mac, microphone is not supported.",2021,12
Thanks,2021,12
The adapter does not connect correctly to controller. barely any sound in headset comes and goes don’t waste your money.,2021,12
I bought these for my son to use when playing the game and he loves them. They do cancel out the noise so sometimes he has one ear on and one ear off. I’m a yeller so he can usually hear me with them on. The mic is clear when he is talking during the game.,2021,12
"Product looks great, but it came broke and box was destroyed. Should have sent it another box instead of a soft package",2021,12
Bought these for my eight-year-old son who is a non-stop gamer and he loves them! He especially likes the light up features. Happy kid=Happy mom! Thank you!,2021,12
Are great. Standing up to daily use for hours.,2021,12
Nice and compact,2021,12
"I wanted to love these headphones because I saw so many good reviews.  Fresh out of the box those blue lights were super cool.  I appreciated that they came with the adapter for headset jack or mic/headphone jacks.  The headset itself was comfy and fit well.  I could hear everything else great....except myself.  Default I couldn't hear myself at all.  I knew to change my windows settings to increase the microphone volume, but unfortunately, the mic quality is just not there.  I tried to use them to game with my friends and they said I sounded worse than the last, much cheaper headset that I had.**UPDATE:  I returned this headset over 6 months ago and the company has directly emailed me FIVE times claiming their product has 'since improved' and keeps offering me compensation to update/take down my Amazon review.  (Read into this as you will.)  I am not interested, please stop emailing me.",2021,12
Son is satisfied!!,2021,12
Made of very cheap material.  They broke the first day using them,2021,12
good,2021,12
Broke with barely any use. The mic stopped working literally the same week I bought it,2021,12
"It says so in the info, but if you're like me you go right to reviews lol. I have tested it with my ps4, fits great over my glasses. I'll update once I use it more.UPDATEI forgot to update this before, but these headphones works fine, lights included. They are comfortable and work with my android phone as well.",2021,12
Poor quality! The noise sucks and the sound quality is HORRIBLE! Wouldn’t even buy it for $5,2021,12
Headset works great sound is quite decent keeping in mind these arent sony headphones.  Can't go wrong for the price... the lights gimmick does suck....but who cares unless your 8 yrs old,2021,12
He has Xbox & Nintendo & he can use on both!,2021,12
It don’t light up.Audio only works on one side,2021,12
"a friend recommended this pair to us as something that will last longer than just a few months. After a year, still uses this nearly every day and works well.",2021,12
They work well and kids love them,2021,12
They work perfectly for my 11 year old gamer. Would definitely recommend. And the lighting is really cool looking.,2021,12
"Cord is like 6ft long and constantly gets caught on things or tangled. Missed that in the description I guess. Would not recommend for console gamers who plug into controllers, cord is too long and will become a trip hazard.",2021,12
Hurts ears and overall sound is not loud,2021,12
My grandson loved them,2021,12
He loved iy,2021,12
Disappointed!!!! I brought  these headphones for my daughter for PS4 for Christmas and They do not work at all and I advise everybody as soon as you get the headphones try them because they don’t work at all,2021,12
I bought this headset a few days ago and this is by far the worst headset I have ever owned the sound in game is horrible and my friends can hear my in game sounds though the headset also it hurts my ears the padding is not very good I can’t stand this headset I threw mine in the trash and will be buying a different one.,2021,12
The microphone doesnt work with PS4.  I went through all of the troubleshooting steps twice and the mic is digital garbage at best and completely unresponsive at worst.Wish I had looked deeper into the reviews before adding to my wish list and having people waste their money on this product,2021,12
Excelente,2021,12
Perfect for gaming. Can hear all the shots in the distance. Dial in where footsteps are coming from at distance and still can’t hear my wife nagging me about how adults shouldn’t play video games from the other side of the couch,2021,12
I used these headphones mainly for gaming on my Playstation but they worked just as good on my pc. I've bought more expensive gaming headphones and these can compete with those except for the noise canceling but it's not bad. The long chord gives you room for gaming from a distance and the volume control on the chord is nicely placed. The led lights looks pretty nice and the fact you have an option to use them or not but still use the headphones is a nice addition.,2021,12
"My son loves them so much! The color is so bright when they light up and he says it's like having a surround set up all to himself! Plus they appear to be made well and fairly durable, which is great for my ten year old boy!",2021,12
"These do not cover the ears well and therefore , let in lots of sound from the outside. I am coming from an old pair of HyperX headphones. They were great other than not having an online volume.  These Bengoo units are absolutely horrible. Head is throbbing within minutes of wearing.",2021,12
grandson really liked this as it works fine,2021,12
Perfect for kids!,2021,12
The microphone doesn’t work with my PS4 controller. Defective out of the box.,2021,12
We love the color and design. Great product for gaming!,2021,12
My son is a gamer and he is very loud. So these were a perfect gift for him.,2021,12
I can hear sound coming from them but the mic stopped working after the second day of use and I can’t get it to work now.,2021,12
It's okay. My head is some what small and they aren't loud enough. If the volume went up it would be better .. thwy did not light up at all,2021,12
"I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend! yes they look very nice, but they slip of your head continuously. The microphone quality is absolute trash, who ever you try talking to, they will not be able to hear you. You can barely hear with these, I set to the highest volume it allows, and it’s so quiet. I did end up returning it and buying a Sony brand headset those were 10/10!",2021,12
My grandson love it,2021,12
Would not recommend,2021,12
Great all around headset definitely recommend them!,2021,12
The headset was uncomfortable and heavy. The plastic felt cheap and it looks better in the picture. I all around couldn't have rated this any higher than one star.,2021,12
"Headphones did not light up and mic did not work, disappointing because it was a christmas gift for my son",2021,12
Easy to install,2021,12
I don’t really like the long cord wish it was cordless,2021,12
Bought this recently and I'm very satisfied.  The audio is excellent.  My only issue is that the cord is very long but it can simply be wrapped.  Great purchase!,2021,12
Bought for my son. Works great and sound is also great. Was really quiet on the xbox until we realized you can turn the vume up on the console. Overall it's great for my 8 year old. Would recommend!,2021,12
"This products microphone almost immediately broke, like day of out of the box kind of fast its kind of ridiculous that I payed this much and then got normal headphones with no microphone",2021,12
These headphones provide a crisp & clear sound for movies or gaming & fit well. I highly recommend these to my family & friends.,2021,12
Use it for the video games.,2021,12
"Ordered 3 set for Christmas.  Everyone got them plugged them up and nobody's mic worked. Tried them in a pc, switch, and xbox.",2021,12
"Didn't like it at all, the sound would cut in an out, the mic didn't work right",2021,12
Great sound quality but the mic is not rotatable so no one can hear me while in-game.,2021,12
My son just opened these for Christmas. He went to pull the microphone down over his mouth the first time he used them and it snapped off.,2021,12
"Perfect for gaming, watching shows on his Kindle, or listening to music!",2021,12
"I have only purchase it for about 3 weeks and this headset …sucks.  I plug it into my ps4 controller and for some reason it keeps messing with the controller.(it keeps automatically scrolling up and down like you are holding down the R-stick). The sound and mic are fine so far but not woth it when you have trouble selecting an option in a game (I have to unplug the headset to be able to select, then plug it back in)",2021,12
the headset is comfortable and good for the money. only complaint is how large the volume and mute button is. i compared it to a roku remote and as you can tell it is fairly large for only 2 things on it. good product tho :),2021,12
"They work good for the price, I would recommend buying for the price",2021,12
"Very well made for sound and mic, but kind of hurts your head after a long period if you have big ears😂",2021,12
"My Son loves his headphones, no complaints so far!",2021,12
"Great sound, very light for a head set",2021,12
These headphones are awesome they're great for the money they cancel out the noise they work perfect they were just bought for my significant other for work and she loves them. I am willing to bet they would great for gaming though great sound.,2021,12
Comfortable. Easily adjust volume. Bass/ Sound is AMAZE BALLS!!,2021,12
I didn’t expect too much but the headset broke within a week.,2021,12
"I am by no means a headset snob. I have some specifications that I want met for a gaming headset. These headphones check a lot of boxes, but not all of them. Unfortunately, I will be looking for a new headset because:1. The microphone is pretty muffled, I am in a party chat 5-7 days a week. My friends have stated that the mic is muffled and kind of muddy.2. Louder sounds make their way through the mic. For example: gunshots, loud animal calls in a hunting game, loud screams/effects from a scary game, etc.3. The mic is fixed. This is obvious with the photos, but I didn't realize how much it would effect me. I can't adjust how close or far the mic is from my mouth, and therefore can't really try to fix mic quality.4. The plastic quality is ""ehh..."" It feels a little cheaper, but you get what you're paying for with a budget headset.5. The bass was not all that impressive. I have had a lot worse, but also much better as well. I'd say it's a 6/10 bass rating, and this is one of the most important features for me.*Everything else about the headset is great, but I don't recommend it for gaming with friends. Their best features include:- Long, braided cord- Crisp, loud and powerful sound- Comfortable and light with great quality earmuffs- Great designCons:- Fixed mic- Bad mic quality- Not best for a really small (losing sound quality) or really large (losing comfort) head- Lacking ""amazing"" bass",2021,12
"Lasted about 2 months, we bought a cheap headset knowing they wouldn’t last long, my son is hard in headsets so at this point it’s better to order cheap and replace often instead of really expensive ones that still don’t last. Good quality for the value",2021,12
really bad and not worth it,2021,12
Heart my ears and a lower quality,2021,12
"These are really awesome, however! The cord gets super coiled up and easily tangled which after having them over a month, it's really annoying and they won't stay untangled..",2021,12
"Couldn’t beat the price on this headset. I just wanted something cheap that would work decent. Of course it seems like pretty cheap plastic but it doesn’t really bother me. They don’t hurt my head/ears or anything like that when I wear them for long periods of time, unlike other headphones/headsets. They light up which is cool, but you can’t plug that part into a controller because it’s a USB for the lighting. Overall, I haven’t had any complaints from the people I play with online. No comments about how bad it sounds or anything so I’m assuming the mic works just fine and so does the sound that comes through the headset.",2021,12
"I received the Kotion Each by Bengoo headphones last Christmas as a gift.  I thought for sure these were $70-$100 headphones when I tried them on my PS4.  They sounded great and gave my girlfriend peace because she now did not have to hear RDR2 constantly.  I could fish, ride horses, hunt, and have shootouts with outlaws all day long.  I do not play online, so I cannot say to the microphone quality, but I have used it a few times on zoom calls and no one had issues hearing me.  I am also a musician and filmmaker and I am VERY picky about sound quality.  Let's be clear...crystal clear (get it?)...these are NOT $500 Sennheiser headphones, but they are VERY good quality for the price, for casual use.  I could not believe the price when I looked them up.  Would I edit an album or film with these?  Yes, for rough cutting.  But I would grab something more reputable for sound final mixing for video and definitely not use these for sound mixing music.  The mix coming out of these is a little on the bass-y side for me, but not enough one couldn't get used to in a few minutes.  And I only know they are slightly bass-y because my ear is trained to hear that stuff.  Most people will not notice this at all.  They have lasted just fine for a year and are still going.  Light plastic body, but nothing has fallen off it yet.  I also take very good care of my things and do not toss them on tables/couches etc, so I cannot speak to how robust they are for people who like to throw things across rooms.  I do not ever pull on the cord, etc.  Mine came with a split connector (3.5mm/USB) which does come in handy sometimes, but the extra dangly cord not being used can be annoying.  Also, the cord is waaaaay long. 7.5 feet-ish?  Which is great, and also annoying, depending on your usage.  But I would take more cord than not enough any day.  The in-line volume knob is great for when different streaming services like to pump out different volumes and your ears get blasted when your show starts...no need to get up and change the computer volume...just lay on the couch and adjust the dial on the cord.  Reversely the dial is great to pump up the volume a bit for those highly compressed videos on the web that are too low to hear.  Overall it gets 4 stars.  If it had a treble/bass adjustment knob, it would get 5.  Cheers to your ears!",2021,12
I like everything about them,2021,12
The headset is really comfortable. It feels natural on the head. My friends can hear me really well when I play and I hear them just fine. You can hear what's going on out side the headset but not real well. I use it for gaming and I really like it. Over all a really good headset.,2021,12
Good audio and mic quality for a cheap price. Also comes with the adapter for PC use. Only complaint I have is the earmuffs are a little small and hurts my ears after extended sessions.,2021,12
First you can either have the headset glowing or you can actually use the mic. Pick one you cant have both. Secondly maybe its just mine but my headset is completly lopsoded. Crocked however you want me to say it. Third due to it being uneven sound quality isnt great. No noise cancelation and its not as loud as i would like it. Last its uncomfortable period,2021,12
Cheap feeing but the ear foam is soft and nice.,2021,12
Garbage headphones. I've tried 2 pairs and the mic quality is terrible. Bought better ones and had zero issues.,2021,12
Bought for my son for his game and it didn’t work I think it needed extra parts but it did not say that.,2021,12
"The headphones are amazing, bass boosting is insanely good. HOWEVER. The Microphone, in a little over a week of having this headset, began to crackle and cut out, my friends kept telling me they couldn't hear me or outright telling me that all they got was static and crackling. I tried everything from updating my drivers, to tampering with sound settings, to reseating the audio cables into different ports, the only conclusion I was left with was the cable was somehow so poorly made that it failed in just over a week.I am extremely disappointed. $50 I could've spent somewhere else. Four and a half stars. How???",2021,12
PS4 and to tune out my little sister and brother,2021,12
We bought this for my son as a gift and after the excitement he went to use them. They have low sound no noise cancellation just a horrible headset. The only thing it’s good for is aesthetics.,2021,12
"So definitely 5 stars here. The sould it's really good. They even fit my big head! 1 issue. I never thought I had big ears. But these don't fit MY ears right and after a bit, they start to hurt slightly. I just take a 3 min break and potty or something and then back at it. Played for 6hrs straight the first day! I can't fault them.",2021,12
I didnt like the headset plug in cause deteriated quickly and quit working on speker and headset complete. Bad plug ins,2021,12
"Once I pulled it out of the box, it’s sound worked, but the mic did not. Peice of Crap not worth the money",2021,12
Sound is pretty good for the price,2021,12
Nice to have,2021,12
"It’s good quality overall, im just a little mad about it not lighting up but it’s still a good gift for a gamer !",2021,12
"Mic has some echo, jack seems loose in controller ... my experience: they sounds ok, if you don't need microphone",2021,12
Very cool !! my brother loved it,2021,12
Uhhhh yeah no,2021,12
"Kittens destroyed my sons last headset, he picked these out & they are working great.",2021,12
They quit working a week after I got them.,2021,11
"Sounds really good for music, not what it is intended for but really good bass and sound for music. Slight complaints about mic but overall good for gaming too. For the price cannot complain.",2021,11
It is great my brother loved it ! He used every day and it was a great investment great product for a Christmas gift for the gamers!,2021,11
Comes just like it shows but nothing works lol,2021,11
I wanted to love it - the sound quality was great. But sadly the microphone would not work no matter what I did so I have to return them.,2021,11
"My son is rough on headsets, so this is a great headset for him, without being too expensive. They are really durable and the sound quality is really nice.",2021,11
"Not the best quality I've seen but for the price, it ranks pretty high.",2021,11
My son loves these! They are definitely noise canceling because he can’t hear anything while gaming.,2021,11
"Do not buy this mic. I’m someone who always checks reviews. With this device, check the questions. Apparently, you need an adapter to use the headset in the first place, which the seller does not include. Secondly, even with the adapter, most say that the mic stops working after a little while even with the adapter. I highly recommend avoiding this product.",2021,11
I bought these to replace my boyfriends old falling apart headphones- and he loves them! He games every night- and said that they where much comfier than his old ones.,2021,11
Mike stopped working suddenly,2021,11
It works great for about a month,2021,11
"They know the microphones are faulty. They know the microphones only work for like a week.The seller doesn't matter the brand doesn't matter there are a million versions of these cheap headsets.Pros: They are loud enoughCons: the microphone WILL break. It's not a maybe. It WILL break.Also They didn't have the giant USB portion of the wire in the photos, I had to cut it off,Thus was advertised as pc AND CONSOLE headphones,Do any of you know a console controller with a USB port for led lights on headphones?Didn't think so.Don't buy these for console, and go ahead and rip the microphone off,",2021,11
"I have been through a few gaming headphones (other brands) for my boys! These are really great quality. Sound, wire, and sound canceling features make this product worth it and great price.",2021,11
"When I bought this headset, the mic is very bad and when I talked in it my friends could barely hear me, I would have to scream into the mic for them to hear me. Also, in order for the led lights to work you have to have a pc. Also, it says there's noise cancelation and when I tried, I could hear everything my friend said behind me and he was whispering, the sound quality is ok but not good enough for almost $40. The bass sucks too. 2/10 Would not recommend.",2021,11
It works. It sometimes works. You never know. Waste $20,2021,11
Works great but the mic was kinda flimsy.,2021,11
"This is the second ine I purchased. I purchse one for me, as I work remotly, and it was really good. This one I purchase it for my dad, as he teaches online. He loves them. Noise cancelling is amazing. No regrets",2021,11
my son says the mic does not work good sound for the headset but does not do what it says,2021,11
"I used these maybe 5 times in three months and those first 4 times they worked alright. The 5th time it seems like there is a short in the wiring. The return window was I think like a month, so I am out of luck.",2021,11
I haven’t used them but they seemed great so far out of the box.,2021,11
Microphone broke 2 months after purchase,2021,11
Got it as a gift for my sis who has a PS5. She adores it,2021,11
"I enjoyed everything about this product its was as advertised, it's worth the value.",2021,11
Daughter my love them..she doesn't have to hear my while doing either thing....lol,2021,11
"Works well but the cord is very clunky. These are stylish and easy to use, but the cord is very thick and heavy. Which I guess is a good thing for durability, but not necessarily for comfort. I do like the option of the volume control being on the cord, but it is already so heavy enough that it is cumbersome.",2021,11
"sound quality is trash, mic didn't even work",2021,11
I love these headphones.,2021,11
I bought for my daughter works great for everything she wants. School and gaming.,2021,11
"My 11 year old uses for gaming. Poor sound and eventually sound goes out. Waste of money, sorry. Going to send back and exchange for better quality headphones",2021,11
Made for people with giants heads who like really hard headphones.,2021,11
"My daughter uses them for gaming, she loves them, no complaints!",2021,11
Exactly what was needed -  description is accurate,2021,11
So I bought this headphones just to check them out and let me tell u this I was amazed and very surprised on how the sound quality for this headphones I recommend this item 100 percent,2021,11
"Got this for my hubby and he loved it for his ps4, then my 8 year old needed one and the cheap $15 one at WM broke so I ordered another for her. Its perfect. She loves it! It tightens for little heads so great for ages 5 and up id suggest.",2021,11
"they feel like cheap plastic and the sound isn’t that great. i’m not a fan of the cord either, but that’s a personal preference. they work if you’re looking for cheap headphones and don’t care.edit: I bought these when they were at least half the price. these are not worth 50 dollars",2021,11
Love the lights.,2021,11
Has a weird echo.,2021,11
The mic volume is a bit low even on high.,2021,09
These are comfortable headphones.  I wear them (even with no music on) when there's noisy distractions outside.  They're also great for phone calls.,2021,11
This company has a great costumer service . We have some issues they resolve with no excuses or delays . Very professional. I love the way they handle make me fell very appreciate has a customer . With you don’t see much this days . Thank you . I very recommend the product.,2021,11
"This is the best gaming headset we have purchased to date. Durable, good noise cancellation, great sound. We’ve had these for a little over a year and compared to others we’ve gotten on Amazon with great reviews, these are the only ones that live up to their 4-5 star ratings. We now own the orange and the purple pairs and have recommended this particular set to friends who have purchased as well. Good buy, can’t say enough good things :)",2021,11
This a cheaper yet good quality head set. I use it for gaming and it works well. The mic doesn't work well on PC but that's ok because I don't use the mic. One side of the headphones stopped working at one point but I just had to unplug it and plug it back in.,2021,11
"You can't use it for consle and still be able to have it light up as the cord where it splits to plug into both isn't long enough of a split,might be good for pc but not for console",2021,11
Lights don’t work unless the usb is connect and u have no play to connect it. And horrible customer service,2021,11
The mic quit  NO way to contact the manufacturer  I bought an Asurion protection plan and they won't help  either BIG WAISTE OF MONEY,2021,11
I got the headset because I needed one for work meetings.  Wanted to drown out the noise when in a meeting.  It does that and keeps the folks in the meeting from hearing the background noise and I get the extra focus.  Not gaming but still works.,2021,11
bought it for my son he loves it especially all the lights that light up,2021,11
Sound very clear,2021,11
Great gaming headset for kids who need it!,2021,11
"The wire is extremely long, suggest wrapping half of it in a small loop so u don’t have so much extra",2021,11
"I was insanely surprised by the overall quality of these. I use them on my PS5, and they sound way better than a $20 headset. Very surprising. 10/10.",2021,11
"After a while(month or two) of using the mic no problems I've noticed when I'm outside of a discord call on my pc it would turn up the game I'm playing like Roblox and spotify to extreme extents and the sound quality would dip kinda just making me not wanna use them outside of a call so now I just close my laptop but always stay in a call. Idk why this is a problem for me maybe because it changes to a mode when you are in a social media call but otherwise the headset is Greta for it's price, mic is a bit loud tho!",2021,11
I've never used a high quality headset but this one has been a huge upgrade from using regular ear buds. The downside is that the cable is heavy and constantly pulling on the headset. It really needs a clip to attach cable to your shirt.,2021,11
These are great. We use them on an old Xbox one for Fortnite and also on a laptop. One of the better headsets we have gotten.,2021,11
After only owning this for less than a year the microphone Does Not Work. This break my son’s heart as playing fortnite without a mic is really devastating.,2021,11
"Overall works ok, ear cushions are too small. I have slightly larger than average ears I guess?Oval shaped holes for ears are 1-3/8” width, 2” height.Other than that seems to work fine. Audio and mic worked without problem.",2021,11
Sound quality has been awesome,2021,11
"The headphones work as headphones. The mic is so poor though that it barely works. No one can hear me unless I yell. Now, I wasn’t expecting amazing mic quality, but it simply does not work. I was on pc using the splitter it came with and then another splitter I owned. Both work, just not the headphones. I compete on my school esports team, and these flopped during practice",2021,11
"Cheap af, audio is the worst I’ve had, garbage all around",2021,11
"ive bought 10$ headphones from walmart with better sound quality. its also apparently designed for babies because i cant see anyone else managing to fit their ears in the earcuffs. overpriced trash, not even worth 5$ do not buy. now they keep trying to bribe me to delete this review lol what a joke",2021,11
I feel like a pro gamer who gets no citches when I have these on nd they my favorite color to on 55 cripp,2021,11
"My son, whom I move with my whole heart, runs through headsets like they grow on trees. I’m unsure how or why it happens, but several sets have been laid to rest. It’s been about a month, and these still look brand new. I would recommend you by them if your child, is a serial headphone killer like mine is.",2021,11
I've ordered 4 of these in a year because the wire end never lasts,2021,11
Found these to be decent quality with good sound.  Cord set is of decent strength and they are still working well,2021,11
Disappointed in these headphones. Save your money and get better quality headphones. It sounds good if you're just listening to it but when you have the mic on its horrible (I play COD on Ps4). So much static and background noise you can't even hear me.,2021,11
These are horrible. If you are a gamer these are not for you invest in better,2021,09
"Would not recommend these to anyone. They are too small and put way to much pressure on your ears. Lights are just a gimmick, she your money and search around for something better.",2021,11
"I bought these about a year ago and when I received them they appeared to be fine but when I used them the cord is heavy, thick, and tugging. The worst part is that if you ever take off the black wrap around the cord the cord will dwindle and tangle until it decides to do it until it permanently damages itself. I used them for about 5 hours one day and never touched them even though they were annoying and I noticed in a video clip I saved, the microphone cut out randomly but audio still coming through the headset and I was confused because I never did anything to damage them so they eventually damage themselves by tangling. I asked my dad to get me another pair of headphones and I told him not the same ones but by the time they had already arrived it had been the same and he didn't realized that he bought the same pair but I figured I'd give them another shot. Once again they tangled themselves to death one day and I realized how cheap this company was and how terrible their products are and how cheaply made they are. If there is anything in this review you note down, DO NOT BUT THESE HEADPHONES. The worst part is them tangling beyond repair and the annoyance of the excess weight to the cord. Quite embarrassing for the company to own such a terrible product.",2021,11
The microphone does not work. Ive tried all troubleshooting options and ive actually gotten sound by doing abunch of settings bs but the mic itself is just bad and the headset feels cheap. Its a cheap headser im aware like the plastic and everything is just not worth it,2021,10
Excellent sound and reception.,2021,10
Super nice priceFor pretty nice headphones.,2021,10
My son loved the headsets!! Definitely a great putchase,2021,10
Not the best fit,2021,10
"Very plush and somewhat comfortable, but the microphone doesn't work at all. The sound quality isn't great either, but at least that works.",2021,10
Got this because I figured I'd have better luck with connectivity while playing Call Of Duty on the PS4... yet I can be standing close to a box and barely hear the sound of it let alone enemy footsteps. (Yes I have the sound at 100 in the game settings and the volume dial turned all the way up.)Sending it back for a refund.,2021,10
On the outside this headset looks great and fits comfortably. I'm not sure if mine is defective or just had something come loose in shipping but it doesn't quite work right. The microphone works fine and the left earpiece works fine. The rights side is where the problem is; I have to move the cord just right to hear out of it. If this was a $30 headset I'd say it's fine but for $50 I feel like I should at least be able to hear out of both sides without having to do a yoga position to get it to work properly. Overall I'd say it's not bad but also not great. Do with that what you will.,2021,10
I bought this gift for my boyfriend and he loves it 💕💕💕,2021,10
"These are a great value with very good sound. They are not JBL, but do have very clear sound.",2021,10
they are good for kids,2021,10
"Looks good, feels good... volume too low!Tried adjusting in game 🎮 not loud enough",2021,10
Sound wouldn’t go directly only into headphones.Customer service only cares about Bad reviews with no intention to do the customer right.,2021,10
"This headset is pretty darn great. However, I feel like the volume cap could stand to be a bit higher. Other than that, I like it!",2021,10
I thought these were really good at first but the same week I went to Burlington coat factory and found a turtle beach headset For $30 once I tried those on I noticed a big difference …..these ones have a lot of background noise there is an echo that doesn’t go away and just the quality it’s different I would go for a different brand. Returned this pair.,2021,10
Great price Great sound can hear everything on Xbox. The headache part is the mic stops working. 1st stop they replaced them. Now the replacement doing the same thing.  Anyone else has this problem.,2021,10
Gaming on my iPhone,2021,10
Love it,2021,10
It was a good product until my dog decided to make it it’s chew toy.  My son used it for gaming  I only had to listen to him yell out things instead of all the players yelling ish out and whining about who was killing who blah blah blah,2021,10
I bought this and tried it for several months. This still works fine for both sound and mic. Performance is also good for the price. My kids love this so I bought another one.,2021,10
Don’t waste your time with this cheap ass headset. I was expecting something to at least work when I unboxed it and was disappointed. I even wasted my time reading the manual and watching a YouTube video to make sure it was “on”. I’m a 20 year old college kid who just needed a mic to play with my friends but I’m just gonna say whatever and buy a quality one from Best Buy. Save your money and time and don’t buy this for your kids or anyone!,2021,10
"Received this great looking headset in Sept, 2021. They stopped working Nov, 5th. 2021. Now, I have to purchase another set. This will be the 3rd pair, however I'm hoping my grandson will search for a different brand or something, this time. I'm not sure. He really did like these.",2021,10
They are too small they are uncomfortable 10 minutes after you try them on,2021,10
My 11 yr.old grandson uses them daily & enjoys them..I would buy this product again.,2021,10
Doesn’t work,2021,10
They lied there’s no LED light on it they sound horrible there is no bass only one side of the headset works I Paid too much money for this The garbage I would never buy anything again🤬🤬🤬🤬,2021,10
"We have had several (more than 5) head sets, this one has survived the longest. It is used by a 9yr old boy, who takes care of it as well as a 9yr old might.",2021,10
"Worked great at first with both my PC and Xbox. Sound was way better than my old headset. After one day it started having problems. It either would not work at all or the mic would not work. Cheap chinese junk, but I did not want to spend a ton on a headset so I rolled the dice.EDIT: Bengoo customer support reached out to me multiple times and offered a refund. I continued to troubleshoot the headset and got it to work with my XBox by buying a new Xbox controller. The microphone still does not work with Discord on my PC however. Changed rating to 3 stars.",2021,10
I don’t know why I expected so much… maybe because of the decent amount of good reviews but these were absolutely trash. Ended up just throwing them in the trash. You’d be better off just buying a basic Xbox headset lol.,2021,10
"This headset it looks so pretty. Love the color along w/ the pink light when plugged in. However, I bought this headset for my work from home job, meaning I need the mic. I performed a mic test, and discovered that the mic doesn’t work. I disabled the built-in mic on my HP PC to ensure sound was coming solely from the headset mic. I heard a low scratchy version of my voice. Gave 2 stars bc music sounds great in the headphones and it feels high quality. I’m returning them bc the mic is about 5 1/2 inches of trash.",2021,10
My son loves these. Uses them everyday. Great find.,2021,10
"These were in my desired price point (dirt cheap) and they have exceeded my expectations. I bought two pairs so my kid and I could play co-op missions on the Switch together. The noise cancelling works pretty well, although I definitely didn't buy them for that feature. Microphone comes in clear and the volume knob and mic mute button are easy to reach. Very impressed.",2021,10
"Super cute for an easy cheap alternative to a gaming headset. The sound quality is definitely not bad for the price. If the game is loud enough, noise surrounding you is practically canceled, but not completely mute. Id say good for kids, and good for a quick need of a headset in a pinch. Headband is a bit flimsy but definitely lasts for a good while.",2021,10
My grandson likes this headset.,2021,10
"i threw these away becuase lights dont work, mic does not work, and the sound does not work!  only good thing is noise cancelation when you put them on. these are terrible!",2021,10
"The Headset is great! Sounds great, not so great in noice cancelling, and my ears hurt after a while using them because I have glasses and they squish my them to my glasses, but aside from that, they are great, and great sound!",2021,10
Trash. Volume is too low.,2021,10
My kid says they’re pretty good. Microphone is great. Noise canceling could be better but overall really good headphones for the price.,2021,10
He uses it for gaming he is very thankful I bought it for hin,2021,10
Cord was messed up as soon as I got it. Sound would cut in and out every few seconds. Made it impossible to play any game with friends or a game that requires sound. Would not recommend this to a third world refugee to salvage as scrap metal. Piece of poop,2021,10
Great for gaming and everyday use.,2021,10
"I can't mention WHY, or Amazon's little gatekeepers won't let my review post.But I CAN tell you that this was a bad purchase, I would NOT recommend it, and that you should buy something else, somewhere else. Quality, sound,  etc were bad. Everything was BAD.",2021,10
The headset itself is great but the chord is extremely long and to get the lights to work it has a seperate usb so I wouldn’t recommend for console.,2021,10
mic doesn’t work and i have to mess with the head jack to get both speakers to work,2021,10
Plugged in and you can only hear if the cord is twisted while you hold it.  Very disappointed and will be returning!,2021,10
"They stopped working after a month, not worth it. Sound quality is not so great, definitely don’t recommend for gaming.",2021,10
"You can’t beat this price, you get 3d sounds for cheap the mic is a little weak but it works",2021,10
"My son loves his headset, he has no complaints and uses it pretty much daily.",2021,10
I love BE GOOD G9000 STERIO GAMING HEADSET because high quality sound and bass in the headset is so amazing shooting guns while gaming. Plus hearing stuff behind you in a game your are playing I also love how you can connect the USB and your headset can light up while you use them,2021,10
He has been using them about a week and we have no complaints. If something changes we will add it to our review.,2021,10
Bought as a temporary replacement for my gamer son when his started messing up a lot and he is very tall and they barely fit but he does like them and says they work good until he can find a pair he would like to get. So great price for a temporary fix.,2021,10
good,2021,10
Bought for Xbox but found it works for the PC also.,2021,10
Well it help my daughter with her school work and so she can hear the teacher very well,2021,10
i like them they work like there name brand just do yourself a favor and buy and audio y mic adator for pc gaming and etc,2021,10
"Ok so I'm just going to avoid beating around the bush and get right to it. The headset is acceptable, especially given the current $25 pricetag, but it's not great, it's really not. I have sensitive ears, had problems with them relating to heat and pressure, so I avoided headphones/sets for a while, but eventually saw how for the world of gaming, headsets dominate over earbuds so I have been on the lookout for a comfortable one ever since (lil beating around the bush there I know, no more I swear).Good:The top headrest part is very soft and squishy, we like this. It's blue. I love blue. The cord is well made, doesn't look like it's tearing anytime soon.Bad:They're not that comfortable, they're not torturous, but I have skullcandy headphones that are way easier to wear.Game sound is very average, can hear decently, but for games like Fortnite that have bad audio to begin with this isn't going to change anything.Ugly:I don't know if this is a defect, but if you plug this into your phone or tablet, and bend the cord a lil while on call, it'll hang up. You watching a youtube video? Cord moves slightly and it skips to the next video. You see how infuriating this can be.It's a 2 pronged connection. They have added a usb connection ONLY for the lights, I get it but at the same time just remove the lighting,  no one wants to have a usb cord swinging everywhere when not using it on pc.The mic doesn't mute when you flip it up. I thought this was an industry standard but apparently not, you have to manually mute your mic with the switch on the panel that dangles on your cord.So that's pretty much it, honestly you'd be getting around the same quality with a $10 clearance pair at your local electronics store, and without the very annoying end call bug. Would have returned but was too lazy. Eh it'll work as a backup I suppose.Edit: BENGOO's customer service took the initiative and contacted me giving out a refund to my amazement. I was concerned it was possibly a scam but they worked with me to refund me without compromising any personal information whatsoever. Huge thanks to BENGOO for having the service more popular companies should have.",2021,10
Wire is a good length but sad that it only lights up when plugged in to a computer by USB. The headphones extension is short in my opinion. Have to pull down all the way and it just barely fits on my head. Overall for the money I paid I think I got a good deal,2021,10
Cost me less than my Sony headphones and feel and sound better.,2021,10
"They are wonderful, just one thing though, everyone on the receiving end can hear everything going on around you.",2021,10
"Sadly, no one said in the comments that the sound is piss poor and no one can hear you speak. There’s no setting to adjust and oddly enough, both connections are on the same cord? Returning these because I have zero use for them. Spend a little more money and get something of value.",2021,10
Its been 2 years and my bf is still using this headset!! Still in perfect condition. Must buy!,2021,10
"Right out the box, the right side doesn't work. Only sound coming from left early piece. Not sure if I received a defective or previously used headset. Do not",2021,10
Seems to work great kids love it,2021,10
The quality is amazing.  I bought them for my fiancé for our PlayStation.  He loves these headphones.,2021,10
I really liked these headphones but after only having them for a couple months the mic stopped working. They can’t hear me at all but I can hear other players. It glitches in and out often. They were great until they completely stopped working.UPDATE:Tried to give me a half bribe to take down my review so y'all can buy more of these cheap headphones! I paid more than 30$ for them..,2021,10
"Purchase this for my grandson, he takes excellent care of all of his gaming equipment, unfortunately these only lasted a couple weeks and stopped working. I’m very disappointed because I cannot get a refund or an exchange",2021,10
"The only thing I didn't like was the microphone, but just like all product in the world not all of them are perfect, and the customer support is amazing! Give it a try for the price!!",2021,10
I actually have to walk up to my grandson before he hears me. These are great.,2021,10
Microphone doesn't work at all. doesn't even show up in my ability to locate and change settings on devices to use the microphone. As well as the switch to mute the mic doesn't work because my computer can only use the mic from the computer. This headset is a real let down. I just go back to using my bluetooth headset that's more comfortable and i can walk around in but without a mic on it. If I'm required to be at the computer to use the mic anyway.,2021,10
Not comfortable.,2021,10
Hmmm,2021,10
Works beautifully. Has same problem all head phones have. HOW LONG BEFORE THE CABLE SNAPS AND THE JACK FALLS OFF?! I took some tooth picks and electrical tape to make a sort off splint around the jack. Confident it will hold. If you have the same problem with head phones try that method. 5/5 stars 👍,2021,10
Bought for my 13yo and he loves them. The LED lights look super cool.,2021,10
Very nice,2021,10
Great,2021,10
Could not get him to work on any of my game systems try 4 hours,2021,10
Great for the price,2021,10
works as advertised.,2021,10
Barely works when plugged in cannot be heard in the party chat smh,2021,10
My son loves them so do I. Hes able to talk with his friends while playing its clear what he hears.,2021,10
Great,2021,10
Nothing wrong,2021,10
"Pros: Sound quality is decent, the in-line volume control is convenient, and they look really cool.Cons: At least my particular headset had a constant static noise even when I use the mute switch on the volume control. I actually had to unplug the mic cable when I was playing as to not annoy the other players.",2021,10
"And im still using this. Its so good and i like the lights, Really good  Cheap headset for gaming! (also the microphone sound is SO GOOD too!)",2021,10
"Sound is okayish, the mic doesn’t work at all tho. So Id definitely pass on getting these.",2021,10
"It’s functional, light weight and does the trick for zapping your enemies online",2021,10
"Within a month of buying this, the connection would short out. It would only work if I twisted the end and held it there. Luckily it stopped working within the return window and I was able to get a refund. Will not purchase from this manufacturer again.",2021,10
Works great don't waste your money on Turtle Beach,2021,10
Great headset. I've paid much more for headsets in the past that weren't as well made.,2021,10
"I use this for work, not for gaming. The sound comes in and out in the left speaker, but the sound quality is better than using my cell phone or computer microphone and speakers.",2021,10
Bought as a gift for our son. He loves them! They work perfectly while he plays his games. I can't hear what he's playing or watching and he can't hear me when I tell him to do chores.,2021,09
I bought 2 & you can’t hear anything on either one of them. My husband & daughter play Xbox with each other in separate rooms. But neither one could hear the other. He replaced his with Turtle Beach & she would try to use both to see if either one would work & he could never hear her & she couldn’t hear him. We replaced hers with a Turtle Beach also & now they just sit.,2021,10
So far it stood up to my 9 year old he bought these  with his Christmas money for his fortnite an every chance he gets he is playing any game or movie has them on since the pandemic an being in virtual school and not really having any friends this was perfect for him to be able to interact and play with some friends that we knew personally an other people [should definitely be sectioned out in age groups DEFINITELY NOT THIS COMPANYS FAULT BY ANY MEANS] he isn't  very easy on them either I'm sure I've heard them dropand hit our very hard floors no less that 40 times an still going strong,2021,10
"bengoo g9000 in blue, i got a refund today. thank you very much.",2021,10
It is decent for its price. although its really tight on the head. Very good vendor. I got a faulty one and got it replaced!,2021,10
To small for my comfort,2021,10
My son loves corded headphones and this was really a nice one. Doesn’t drowned out all noise but does the job for the money,2021,10
"Sound is good but I still hear things unless it's on blast, the mic is meh, but it's easy on your head",2021,10
Right out the box. You can hear perfectly but I couldn’t be heard it said my microphone was on and making noise but no one could hear me did not glow blue at all cord was already lose and when you move it sound would jump and go in and out,2021,10
This item is not what I was expecting.,2021,10
"I bought this, as I needed a replacement headset that utilized USB connections.This uses 3.5mm connections for audio.  The USB connection just turns on the LEDs.  So it looks great, but doesn't do jack.In addition, the headset itself is uncomfortable.  Heaven help you if you already have a headache and you throw a pair of these on.Congratulations to the manufacturers; I have never returned an item to Amazon before this one.  You have won the prize.",2021,10
Great customer service tho,2021,10
The sound is good it’s just the mic when I talk my friends say they can’t hear me good,2021,10
Microphone failed within a week,2021,10
My team usually has a hard time hearing anything I’m saying due to the headsets poor microphone. The sound quality is fair. And the long and bulky cord can be a bit of a nuisance,2021,10
Still can't believe how good this product is for the price. I've been using this headset for the past couple of months and it is solid!,2021,10
"Works great for casual gaming! Comfortable for long periods of time. Run into issues sometimes where if a lot of effects go on in game headset has a hard time following, but that rarely happens. Best headset for the price tbh",2021,10
These do NOT work with computers. Windows does not recognize them and no software exists to help. You can hear people but the mic does not let people hear you.  They work great on laptops. The mic and lights are problematic. Noise canceling and comfort are spot on with everything except computers.,2021,10
"The mic had very low input signal when it worked, but mostly it would cut out and not work at all.",2021,10
Update....I received a replacement pair after the mic on the first was static-y.  My son uses these for gaming so the mic is really important.  The mic was exceptionally clear. Sound is great too.  Very pleased especially for the price..,2021,10
Worked ok for a month. Now there is background noise and a bad echo,2021,10
"I love this headset, it’s very good for music and gaming. Even if it only seems to support standard Sony controllers, so I couldn’t use my custom controller with it. But it’s no big deal, it still lets you hear things, you just couldn’t use the mic since you didn’t come through. But the sound quality was really good and crisp, especially when it comes down to Bass, it was perfect.TLDR, Great as long as you have a Sony brand controller and nothing aftermarket.",2021,10
For sure it’s nothing for professional gaming and music but for that value it’s really good.You can’t do anything wrong with if you don’t have high expectations and look for an spare device.My daughter is happy with.Good quality for good price,2021,10
So far so good. Much cheaper than expected but time will tell,2021,10
I wish I could hear myself in my headphones but beyond that great for the price sound quality is good not great and mic is clear,2021,10
"Cute and comfy but the volume does not go up too high. High enough for most gameplay, but I play games where I need the extra volume at times",2021,09
"most think this will work on a gaming console. Partially they will. but how the console is designed, there is no USB PORT NEXT TO AN AUDIO outlet.  there fore the player is left to choose between the lights on the earphones working or the audio working... and we all know audio is a must.  so all that is left....  IS WHATS THE POINT OF THE LIGHTS IF YOU CANT USE EM WHILE U GAMEthese are computer gaming earphones",2021,09
Ow,2021,09
He hasn't complained about them. So it's a plus.,2021,09
"Great product, good starting set for small children who are prone to destroying things often. The upside is they are quite affordable too so it doesnt take much to replace them when the inevitable breaking happens! Thanks so much for delivering what was advertise, and at such a speedy rate!",2021,09
Broke within a few months,2021,09
"Edit:Their customer service reached out after I posted the review saying they changed manufacturers and asked me to give them another shot. I tried them again, and while I still can't say they're noise canceling, the sound and fit are excellent for the price. The microphone quality is pretty nice too, a friend mentioned it makes gaming with me much easier lol. All in all, these are prolly $50-$60 headphones at a $30 price point, and the customer service is incredibly responsive.The sound is pretty good, and they fit well, but it blocks no sound whatsoever. If that's mainly why you're buying it, you'll want to look elsewhere. Even with sound playing i can hear background noise clearly",2021,09
Love this headset has great quality and never glitches like my other one it’s a great price and has amazing features 100% recommend,2021,09
Product is cheaply made and also microphone isn’t compatible to XBOX. Very disappointed.,2021,09
I've really liked these headphones but I've only had them for a couple months and the sound is already going out on them. Does anyone know what the company's warrantee on this product is?,2021,09
"I specifically did a search for XboxOne headsets and this came up as an option, but it is NOT compatible with XboxOne.",2021,09
It's OK,2021,09
"I bought these about a month ago. They are already cutting out and fuzzy, and in fact were doing so merely a few days into my purchase. Do not recommend. How this headset has such high ratings is beyond me.",2021,09
I can hear but the mic does not work. I may have gotten a defective set.,2021,09
"This is for young kids, don’t buy as an adult. Piece of garbage! So quiet I can’t hear anything, and built poorly. Definitely a budget headset. I’ve bought better headsets from 5 below for 5 bucks.",2021,09
AWESOME PRODUCT!!,2021,09
Noise cancellation and output sound was fine.  However the microphone leaves a lot to be desired.  People on the other end could barely hear me and said i sounded like i was super far away.  There is also no way to adjust the microphone so that it sits closer to your face; it's in a fixed position.,2021,09
I had an issue with the first pair but the return process was fast and easy.  I plan to order more for my nieces and nephews!  Highly Recommended!  Item arrived fast and as described,2021,09
great value. My grandson love it,2021,09
They’re just cheap quality and they’re not really comfortable. Mic isn’t that good and they literally snap crackle and pop when you go to put them on your head.,2021,09
Stopped working  within the first week of use,2021,09
"Headphones: Clear sound, working as intended.Microphone: Microphone performance is abysmal. My friends could not understand me. I switched back to my last microphone to solve this issue.Verdict:This headset, if it did not have a terrible microphone (or did not have a mic at all), would be a solid piece of equipment.If you can find a headset with better microphone quality, grab that instead.",2021,09
You will have a great piece of technology in your ears at a low cost. Just enjoy them.,2021,09
My only complaint is these were meant to be a Christmas present and i never expected they would not be in a box or something and the person they were for answered door and since he asked for them he knew they were his.. kinda ruined that gift,2021,09
"When playing games, I can hear the other players, but cannot talk to them.  That feature quit shortly after receiving the headset.",2021,09
I've been using these headphones for a month now and still works really good for my ps4,2021,09
Great headset. Simple for what you need it for,2021,09
Don’t bother with this one. It looks fine but the padding it’s very uncomfortable the sound is terrible not worth the money at all I will be returning this,2021,09
Broke after a month. Couldn’t hear out of them anymore,2021,09
"Bought this for my son and he loves it!...Great look, function and value---triple threat!",2021,09
"This headset works well. It's decent quality, the sound is good. They definitely aren't noise canceling, but that doesn't bother me. Overall, glad I bought this!",2021,09
PS4 works great! I can’t hear a word people say around me they have to yell for me to hear .,2021,09
The sound quality was a lot better than I expected and my son loved the lights,2021,09
They do the job for sure! But then you can expect it because of the price but for the price they are nice,2021,09
These really helped my son,2021,09
"The mic didn’t last very long until it started having problems. Also, you can’t move the mic around so people can’t hear you.",2021,09
"Connects well, fits well on the ears, sound quality is great, and mic boom does a good job.  Definitely worth it.",2021,09
These were great for the money they work well with the Xbox one sounds good,2021,09
Works as expected. Very comfortable. Sound quality is good. Great price,2021,09
Microphone required db to be increased and barely picked up voicing. The constant static made my friends go nuts,2021,09
"I use these during my conference calls at work, always clearest one on the call when I tell them how much they disappoint me.",2021,09
"I think they are good especially for the price but I wish that they were more adjustable.  They are great for sitting up and listening to TV or gaming, but if you want to lay down or have them adjusted to your head they are not good.  They feel bulky and don't quite fit to my head.  For someone with a slightly larger head, they may fit.  However, with them not being adjustable I think my problem would be flipped if someone with a really large head put them on as they are not adjustable.  Also, the two connection types with one cord hanging all the time is just a huge bother, and it is definitely a design flaw.  There should be some way to tuck the unused connector up so it doesn't dangle and become a nuisance.  Sound, noise cancelling, and upright use is all good though.  I gave it a 3 because of these factors.",2021,09
In order for your lights to work you would need a HDMI extender to connect to your controller and or outlet,2021,09
"So I bought it because it was on sale for 15 dollars (that should have been my first hint) the sound quality was terrible I've had better call quality on a ham radio from the 60s. Freinds said it echoed and had a static sound, and there is about a football feild length of wire hanging on it that's just irritating.",2021,09
This is my fourth blue one. Headset last about 6 months to 1 year. My son like it. I am unhappy because I paid for a NEW headset and a used one arrived.  Waste of my time. Now I have to return it.  I reordered the green one it cost more. It better be new.....,2021,09
Pretty good headset but not as loud as you would think and not good for extended gaming sessions. i get uncomfortable after awhile.  it would be 5 stats if sound volume was abit better and abit more adjustable headpiece for comfort,2021,09
Sound quality is good,2021,09
Quality of product and sound are very good!,2021,09
Very cheap quality and the sound is ehh. Worked really well the first day then all of a sudden was static and couldn’t hear the sound clearly.,2021,09
"Bought 3 headphones, 2 pink and 1 blue and the blue one is great, but okie of the pink ones doesn’t work at all.",2021,09
Sounds great. Mics good. Worth the money.,2021,09
got it for my bf & he loves it just wishes the light would stay on without it being connected to the outlet.,2021,09
Not what you want! do not order. Nothing explained correctly at all. You cannot light it up unless you can play your x-box looking at it from behind. USB only for the light- computer USB. too many wires and too short too enjoy. Do not buy you will be very disappointed. I buy a lot from amazon but will not buy BENGOO products ever again.,2021,09
my mic has stopped working. Had it for 2ish months. Other then my mic not working it has very good sound for gaming.,2021,09
"I am very pleased with Bengoo, I was charged twice for this product and they kindly helped me and refunded the extra charge. I would absolutely purchase again!!My son is enjoying this head set!!",2021,09
"Works as advertised and looks great. A little bulky for my tastes but it does its job.  Note as others mentioned the wording on the headset itself is different than in the picture displayed, but it is the same model.I would  5 star it if it was a little more comfy for long hours of use, but after an hour or two because of its weight and bulk, it really starts to become uncomfortable (for me).",2021,09
Took 6 days to ship. So much for prime next day shipping. And won't light up without being plugged into a USB. Waste of time and money.,2021,09
"I don't like the fact that the mike doesn't pick up voice very well. Its about half the reason why I bought it.The overall construction is not very sturdy. The plastic is brittle. The LEDS work as advertised, but it takes an entire usb port. So you need three open ports on the front of the pc just to have the headphones work with features.The headphones themselves are uncomfortable and not better than the cheap headset I was using before. The audio quality isn't great.Pros: they look cool but that's about it.Don't pay full price for these. I'm glad I didn't.",2021,09
All,2021,09
I play PC and Xbox so I got this mic for gaming on both or one of them I didnt really care but I tried it on the PC first and it wasn't the best sound quality and I was trying to chat with people but that didn't go well so I tried on the Xbox hoping it would work better on there but nope it didn't so now I'm not getting this mic again cuz it was trash maybe I got a bad one idk so I got one from Walmart that work really good for everything I need it for amd it was like $37,2021,09
Headset literally stopped working less than two uses in,2021,09
Mic quit working after a month,2021,09
Good for gaming and music great sound for the price,2021,09
"Final Update: I received a new headset and surprise, a working mic, this new headset also has better audio quality. Thankful they really care about their customers!! Thank you!Update: They saw my negative review and have emailed me to try to fix the problem with either a refund or replacement. Excellent customer service! I've decided to give them another chance and ask for a replacement. Will update with the results.For the price and what I needed to do, it works, however the mic doesn't even work at all. I ended up using my Antlion Mod Mic Wireless and it works fine. The sound is okay, but that's what you get for choosing price over quality.",2021,09
Son is very pleased with these headphones.  Used for schoolwork and gaming,2021,09
i love this product,2021,09
"my son bought this for gaming but they wee damaged/ did not work.  He unfortunately told me after the return window was closed ,",2021,09
My son loves it. It lights up he says he feels like he’s in the game,2021,08
This would be a 5 star but in order to use light on headphones you have to plug it in & that wouldn't be bad but the cord to plug it into ur Xbox is SUPER short!! You would have to latterly but on top of the system to use it. Other than that they are fine. Don't buy this for the light because they probably won't be close enough to the TV to use it.,2021,09
Still testing them out,2021,09
 At this point I’d call this false advertising. I bought this to use on Discord. Unless you have room for 7 feet of cable and want to have that garbled my mike will never work sound quality don’t bother buying this piece of junk. Not to mention there are just so many things to plug in. It’s cheaply made and I’d get something better at dollar general. Waste of time.,2021,09
"Came broke out of box, sound quality good but mic function",2021,09
It did not light up ass it shown on the puture,2021,09
Barely had them a month and the left ear already has a short.Now they tried to pay me to remove the review. Don't trust them.,2021,09
Cord and wires are low quality. After only a few weeks of use 1 speaker goes in and out and you have to play with the jack and cord to get it to work.,2021,09
Lights only work when connected to USB,2021,09
Absolutely love these headphones. The cord gets in the way sometimes. But the sound quality is very good and for the price I love these. I bought a red one and blue one for me and my son. He loves them,2021,09
"Great headphones,  nice selection of colors and can be used on multiple devices",2021,09
headset is ok --sound is ok---little tight on ears.,2021,09
"Awful. First thing, I opened the box, the headphones looked beautiful and I was so excited to try them out. I tried connecting them to my computer with one wire, didn't work, tried another, didn't work, finally worked with the extender thing. I called my friend to play Valorant after, he said the mic quality was AWFUL, and it is. The sound is also terrible. Can only hear through one side or the other at a time and they're extremely uncomfortable. Can barely adjust them, mic is very far from face. They would also disconnect constantly, and when they did I had to set them back up, they also crashed my game every time they disconnected. Do not buy. Not worth it.",2021,09
I love the sound quality and the noise cancelation of the headset and the overall quality of the headset like for the price it is it is extremely worth it,2021,09
My kids like it,2021,09
"Nice gaming headset for cheap. Mic works great, sound is great, and the options to use for Xbox, PS5, or computer is pretty sweet. My only gripe is the ""noise cancelling"" isn't anywhere near a Bose, Beats or JBL and if you have a pumpkin head like myself (it houses a BIG brain for gaming...duh), this headset can be a little uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. Overall 4/5 Stars and I'd buy again",2021,09
"The sound from the headphones are good however the microphone is BARELY picking up any sound. I’ve adjusted sensitivity levelS and microphone boost to no avail. The only way it picks up sound is if, by hand, I pull the mic closer to my mouth, which kind of defeats the purpose Super unfortunate.",2021,09
They don’t light up blue  like it shows on the picture. The sound is vary poor. they are not loud enough for you to hear the game. Don’t waste your money 💵,2021,09
The mic doesn't even work and there's no noise cancelation the mic didn't work the first day the audio started cutting out on the second day,2021,09
Only cool thing is the lights and they don't work unless you plug in USB... Cheap cord broke within a month. Wou,2021,09
Its sound quality is best.,2021,09
Great purchase as a gift my brother love it for gaming. Great sound!,2021,09
This worked for two days and then it broke,2021,09
My sons headset has suddenly stopped working -he cant hear anything and just got the headset about 6 weeks ago. Anyone else experience this?,2021,09
The sound is fine but the mic is not good.,2021,09
"My wife got me this headset and OMFG the amount of trouble they caused in the span on a gaming session!it started before gaming as well. at first I could either get to hear or have the mic (Kinda) work, if you could call it could only pick up me tapping on it working.I and my wife fiddled with setting, Plugged it it different ways like in the speaker jack like my last set, Though my Xbox controller and directly into my PC with and without the splitter. Finally my computer noticed the headset in the Xbox controller, OH BOI I will give it another chance and have a 4 hour gaming sesh with my friends... Yeah about thatSpent an hour trying to fix the headset AGAIN! either no one could hear me, I was super quite Or I was breaking up so bad it was pointless to talk with this headset I basically spent the remainder time yelling over to my wife's headset (she was also playing with us) just for people to hear me! well awesome my voice is now shot for the night, coool.Oh and my ears, OMG is this headset uncomfortable to my ears, I don't think I have ever had a set that didn't completely cup my ears, Spoiler alert, these don't. I was complaining about the ear pain these were causing me before we even started playing and before the hour of trying to fix my mic.the sound was nice and they look kinda cool... sending them back and sticking with turtle beach -_-",2021,09
For me you had to have the headphone jack in a certain spot and stay still for the sound to stay on. It works only sometimes but the more you move the more it cuts out. But the sound was very clear and my party could hear me clear when it did work.,2021,09
It looks good and sounds great. I gi e the noise canceling a 4 out of 5. It is good but it could  be a lot better. Definitely a good buy if you are 9n a budget.,2021,08
Don't work!,2021,08
"Dislike completely. Do not buy do not pass go, this product is useless for its intended purpose. Yes, I want to use the light feature which requires me to plug in the USB cable which is only 4” long same length as the audio cable that plugs into the controller. Unless your willing to sit with a portable charger this product is of no use to me and I recommend anyone that wants to use the product for its intended purpose to wait until they make the cable an adjustable length.Veteran , Nerd , out.",2021,09
Wired set up.,2021,09
They are not the best at noise cancelling but everything else works great!,2021,09
Awesome headset for gaming at a great price.,2021,09
Tried these for the first time and mic doesn’t work. I will be returning.,2021,09
It's not the worst and it's certainly not the best but overall I think that it was a bit too expensive for its quality.  It it supper uncomfortable.  The mic is SUPPER quiet and there is no way to turn it up.  overall I highly recommend getting a turtle beach headset.,2021,09
Great headphones to replace those expensive Astro a50s,2021,09
"purchased these as a quick fix for a broken pair of quality headphones, while my new ones arrived. Used for gaming only. Very big and bulky. Below average sound quality. Appreciate the lengthy wire. They’re ok.",2021,09
Excellent sound & noise cancellation! My 9 year old loves them!,2021,09
Would suggest beginning gamers to use it,2021,09
"They have good sound quality and experience but the volume is a little l light, hopefully that's just my bad ears",2021,09
My grandson wears them alot,2021,09
"Decent sound quality, directional sound works well, mic is a little quiet but you can easily fix this in settings on the windows pc I am using so no problems there. The USB seems miscellaneous unless you want them to light up, which is kinda cool honestly lol, but would be nice if the USB extension was removeable",2021,09
The sound is really good but the reason why I gave it a four star for gaming is because i wear glasses and most headphones make usually make my ears hurt but this one is really great at lessening that but of course it's not perfect,2021,09
Squeezed tf out of my head sent it back,2021,09
Had them for 3 months and loved them. After that I was having trouble with them connecting to the Xbox and after a few weeks of that they just died.,2021,09
The extensions are not quite long enough and they are little tight.....,2021,09
"My son loves it but it broke after a few months that he couldn't talk to no one but he can hear them, he wants me to buy him another headset",2021,09
"Bought these headphones for my son to use with his PS4. He can hear others just fine, but the mic doesn’t work. Very disappointing. Just arrived and took it out of the box today.",2021,09
The quality isn’t very good on these. Sound wasn’t the best either.,2021,09
"its trash, sounds quality is trash, microphone is trash. save your money",2021,09
Na,2021,09
If I could give 0 stars I would. I paid for same day delivery and I showed up 4 days late. I finally get them and the sound quality is bad and there was loud static coming from the headset,2021,08
I'm coming from a $150 pair of hyperx cloud 2 headset. They recently stopped working so I just bought this as a cheap replacement and boy was I surprised. The sound/mic quality is just as good as my old hyperx headset. Don't waste your money on expensive headsets this is def worth the price,2021,08
"My son goes through pairs often, these have been the ones that have held up the best",2021,08
"Good headphone. It doesn't give a Lot of room to adjust on your head, I wish the head part could extend further",2021,08
"With all my volumes up and cranked, its so quite.",2021,08
Husband loves them. He wears them everytime he plays the game. I can be yelling his name for 30 minutes and he will not hear me with them on.,2021,08
Could be better,2021,08
This was absolutely the worst headset I ever received. I had bought the adapter and plugged it into my Xbox 1 controller the sound was so far away even on high volume. The quality was bad it looks nicer in the picture than it actually is. I would not recommend this item AT ALL,2021,08
good for the price,2021,08
If you are looking for an entry level headset this is great!!! Good sound and good noise reduction. For the price you can't go wrong.,2021,08
My daughter loves them! Would highly recommend! Shipping is fast!,2021,08
The cord is entirely too irritating and in the way!!,2021,08
They sound pretty good and they feel reasonably comfortable but they feel cheap and the audio output is terrible. The guys I play with don't really understand what I'm saying most of the time so I spent a bit more money and got myself a nice pair. They're a decent backup pair. EDIT: Bengoo just reached out to me to refund the product if I changed my review... I respect them trying to make it right but on the other hand... I don't like review bribery,2021,08
Good product for the money,2021,08
"I like this headset a lot more than the red and blue headset, the microphone quality has some issues using it on Discord and can be a little tricky to gauge the sensitivity but the sound is pretty good. It is crisp for the most part, I love to use these headphones because they're also very comfortable.",2021,08
"I got this headset I think around 2019 or 2018 but still it is working and the lights have not faded one bit. definitely get this, it's a money saver and it makes an amazing gift for you or your kid.",2021,08
These headphones do not work. Will be returning. Highly disappointed had high hopes.,2021,08
"Ordered this and received on 8/26.  While the audio quality wasn't ""high end"" by any stretch, husband was happy with the way these felt and sounded in terms of my usage. He used them for gaming and online chat, but the microphone on/off switch has broken after 5 days of use, rendering this headset completely useless for its intended purpose.  My husband has resorted to taping and gluing up the headset which was broken and ""unwearable"" because that headset still works.  This one, not so much.",2021,08
"My son loves his headset, they are perfect for his PS4",2021,08
The price point is good but these are functional.hut not comfortable.,2021,08
Had this head set for 3 months and the sound started cutting out really bad on it,2021,08
"I got them for my son as a birthday present, so far he been really enjoying them. He loves that they light up. He thought it’s so cool.",2021,08
"The box came opened and smashed. The microphone barely worked at all and now simply does not work. The sound is fine, the microphone was just an important part.",2021,08
It works and does everything you need it to. The quality of sound just isn't there. But it works pretty good and will get you going. Good starter headset. If your wanting quality you might want to get something better,2021,08
"I would recommend this headset, we have been very satisfied.",2021,08
Either i sound a mile away or i blow out my friends ears with static there is no inbetween no matter what settings i fiddle with i'd rate it a 0 if i could,2021,08
"Initially, when I ordered this, it was pretty bad to be honest, however, the nice people at BENGOO reached out and addressed to me that they have fixed the overall issues I had with on the headset. They were willing to send me another one.After reviewing the new headphones, I was amazed at the improvement. For the price, this is definitely a headset you want to get your hands on. The Sound quality is great and the mic quality is very clear. I am now very satisfied with this purchase. If you are looking for reasonably priced, top quality wired headsets, this one should definitely be taken into consideration.",2021,08
This is a great prouduct. Works as good as Beats,2021,08
Has a 2 part plugin. USB is for the lights. And headphone jack for sound. More for laptop than using with controllers.,2021,08
mic broke after a few months and i know its these headphones because every other headset ive used worked,2021,08
We like it! Sounds great,2021,08
Pros:1. Super great sound2. Pretty noise-cancelling3. Great volume4. Mic is decent for the price and filters out exterior sound pretty wellCons:1. Super tight on ears (keep having to take them off to pop my ears even though my ears are tiny)2. It works far better with my laptop (alienware) than my pc (ibuypower) but I doubt that's to the fault of the headphones.,2021,08
These do not work.  Waste of money . No sound at all.,2021,08
This headset has blown me away by how good it is. Very good quality. If you are looking for just a basic do the job type of headset this is it.,2021,08
My child uses this for gaming. He’s very happy with it! He’s picky about headsets and this one seems to work well enough for him without any complaints. He’s able to chat with others while gaming and sound quality is good for him. Easy to use and no setup required for gaming on pc!,2021,08
This headset is extremely comfortable and has great sound quality but unfortunately has an annoying static/buzzing sound when I'm talking to my friends. Very disappointing!,2021,08
These stopped working in 1-2 weeks. Cuts out sound and mic. Bad connection on the inside somewhere. Cord is also ridiculously too long.,2021,08
"It’s not damaged, the cord isn’t messed up but I bought it 8/23 and today 9/1 it’s already done lol if I connect it, the sound doesn’t fully come through like as if you have to keep adjusting the cable like an old school broken iPod. The mic isn’t working bc of this. Terrible, would have rather bought another brand same price. Don’t buy.",2021,08
"For the price, you absolutely can’t beat these! The brand name was a very odd twist on a more notable brand, but very solid product!",2021,08
it does not work,2021,08
Save your money and buy a hyper x or turtle beach headset these are trash.,2021,08
The sound is great and for a call of duty player it’s all about hearing the footsteps and these babies do that perfectly. It’s a game changer!,2021,08
"I am told people can barely hear me when im not talking loud. Its probably the distance the mic is from my face bc its worse when the mic isn't all the way down. Also, i dont use the lights on this. I hook it into my game controller which is way too far from any computers to be able to plug the usb in at the same time (which powers the lights). If ur audio plug is right next to a usb plug, there shouldn't be much issue.This does not have the feature that turns the mic off when the bar containing the mic is up.Over all, i got this on primeday and its my 1st headset ive used for gaming. Its functional",2021,08
Overall I really like them. They're a fairly solid product. Comfortable to wear. Sound quality it good. They feel sturdy and easy to operate. The only complaint I have is that the cord is a little bulky and cumbersome but even with that I'm actually kind of glad that its sturdy and feels durable.,2021,08
Haven’t had them that long maybe a couple of months and the sound has went out on one of the headphones,2021,08
My husband absolutely fell in love with them. They are so comfortable for him and work perfect!,2021,08
"Sounds quality was fine but stopped working within 10 months, I kept the cord straight and didn’t bend it much but it’s losing connection",2021,08
Love the color and sound quality,2021,08
My child loves this headset,2021,08
good head set,2021,08
"It’s good, very good, I’m sure there are better out there but I got it for like 20 dollars, and this might be a competition for the very expensive ones",2021,08
I've had this headset for less than 6 months and the mic has already started to go out. I have to have the cord a certain way for it to work. If the mic is working and I move the cord whoever is on the other end can hear ridiculous amount of feedback. I play on Twitch streams so it's great to go back to watch and all you can focus on is the feedback from this headset. Not worth the $30 I spent. I'd rather buy a Razer headset that'll cost me more in the beginning but I don't have to worry about it braleaking 6 months in.,2021,08
Do NOT buy!! The headset needs a special adapter to even work!! Waste of money.,2021,08
Junk quality. have had other cheap brands these are junk quality sounds muffled. basically have to scream into the microphone too,2021,08
"We went on a long vacation so I worked part of the time, having meetings in the car. The people on the other end were able to hear me and not background noise from the road (even in torrential rain!).  I was also able to hear them clearly. It was exactly what I'd hoped for!",2021,08
My son uses it for gaming and listening to videos while he does his school work on a laptop. Great quality will by more for my nieces and nephews.,2021,08
"Bought these as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. Mind you, he tends to have expensive taste when it comes to technology. After putting them on, he scolded me because he figured they must’ve costed one to two hundred dollars lol thanks Amazon. Great clarity of sound and noise cancellation. 2 months later they still work great.",2021,08
My kid liked these headphones for his gaming system but I really like them for doing my telehealth video sessions for work.,2021,08
"For The Price It's Not A Bad Headset. Sound Quality Is Good, Could Use A Sound Booster, Like A Button To Increase The Bass Or Treble. That's Just My Opinion After Using Multiple Headsets That Comes With Those Features. Overall, They Are Right In The Middle As Far As Sound And Price Is Concerned. Also, The Cord Is Alil Long, Like 3 Foot Long. Wish It Was Shorter. There Is Also Two Connects At The End. It's Split With The Headphone Jack And A USB At The End Of The Cord. Not Really A Big Thing, But It Does Get In The Way Sometimes.",2021,08
The product looks high quality.  Exactly like the picture. Its light weight.  Noise cancellation imdepends on the volume and cab be adjusted. Instructions are simple and to the point.,2021,08
Bought these for my son. 3 months they worked well but then the microphone stopped working,2021,08
I received it and it wasn’t a BENGOO product and it didn’t light up like described.,2021,08
These are pretty good if you aren’t looking for long term. they work great but mine only lasted a few months before just completely giving out randomly,2021,08
Bought as a gift for great-grandson and he loves it.,2021,08
Don’t waste your money,2021,08
Some reviews says these headphones are better than $100+ ones. No. They are not. I have Sony Studio Monitor MDR-7506 to compare with.Specs shows 15 Hz to 20 kHz. Not even close to 20 kHz. Sound like from metal barrel - without high frequencies and with over-boosted bass.Can not turn off LED light. There is a thing like a button on sound control box. I thought it should be LED switch button. It is not a button at all.,2021,08
Enjoy using.,2021,08
It broke after having it for 3 months. It was nice when I first got it but no one could hear me when I talked into the mic.,2021,08
"The sound quality is great, but no matter what configuration of setting I change on my council. It still sounds like I am talking from across the room. The pickup on the mic just isn’t great.",2021,08
"I ordered these for myself.  My current headset's just reached the end of it's life and needs replaced.  These appeared similar and were near the same in price. But oh boy. The quality.  First off, unless you have an extremely tiny head, or are a child, these are not for you.  The ear cuffs are absurdly small, I had my Japanese roommate try them on and even he laughed at how ridiculously tiny they were. There's no way you could wear these for any length of time without getting a headache from the pressure to your ears. But hey, maybe they'll sound great and I can get past that.  NOPE! The audio was muffled and quiet, had to turn my volume up five fold to hear anything compared to my worn out set (The set that's literally falling a part sound better... come on....) All of this comes after waiting a much longer delivery time than quoted, by almost a week, and when the package DID arrive it was crushed.  Headset seemed unharmed, but with the sound quality, who knows maybe that's a factor.  I can't say. All I CAN say is that these are absolute junk.",2021,08
Everything about it,2021,08
It just wasn’t worth the money,2021,08
"Would not work with any controller I have. Only worked with my phone. I have 3 different types of Xbox one controllers and it didn’t work with any of them.Cheaply made, poor quality.",2021,08
"She's on her second pair (7yr old), but the first set lasted over a year.  Great for how she treats them,  and the price!",2021,08
People could barely hear me no matter how close the mic was to my face,2021,08
They do feel cheap and that's ok for the price but the mic and sound are better than expected so you won't be disappointed of you consider the price. The mic is loud and clear and it does an amazing job at filtering my music playing on the background so it just picks up my voice and does not disturb other players.,2021,08
The sound for the head set is ok but not good or amazing in any way. It’s hard to hear the people talk sometimes it sounds like they’re far away or something. It is also heavy on the cable side. It feels clunky dealing with it,2021,08
"First 5 months was nice, but after that they do not work anymore.",2021,08
"I love them, it sounds great when I use it on my xbox or on my cell phone.",2021,08
No problem,2021,08
Only one side worked,2021,08
Has very loud buzz when using mic on Xbox Series S controller. Other than that has great sound and bass but will have to return due to loud buzz when using mic for voice messages and party chat.,2021,08
The best headset you can buy for the money... hands down!,2021,08
"My grandson loved it, the first week,  then the lights stop working, mow the sound. One week!",2021,08
"The sound quality is fine. The mic quality is okay. But, the mic only works with my AirMac and not on my Windows PC. Its a great set for the price. Would recommend for first time Headset users.",2021,08
Microphone sound is a bit tinny but for 20 dollars everything else delivered.,2021,08
Bought this item for a birthday gift. He's been using since. No problems.,2021,08
"Buzzing in the headset, not compatible with xbox one",2021,08
"My son received these headphones for Xmas 8 months ago. They worked great for the most part. The switch to turn the mic on and off was touchy, he’d occasionally have to flip it back and forth to get it to work. He said sound was great and noise canceling was ok. The worst part is that he was using it today and the cable/cord just came apart. As far as I know it’s not fixable unless I get a soldering gun but I have no idea how to do any of that. We have one bummed kiddo.",2021,08
Had some issues with my first headphones I purchased and customer service reached out to me to rectify the situation. And the new pair they sent is amazing. Pleasantly surprised with the quality. Thank you guys again for going above and beyond for your customers.,2021,08
Use for gaming.Noise cancellation could be better.,2021,08
This is great for beginner gamers. The headset is comfy which is important because we use it for hours and hate when headsets gives headaches from the pressure. It does cancel outside noise pretty well but you can still hear a bit. Which I prefer since I would like to know if I’m being spoken to when playing. But you have to take headsets off to actually hear other people in the room.I like that you can use in the PC and PS because the headset Jack works with the PS4 remotes. Like others mentioned the usb has to be connected to light up. For us we don’t mind the light not being lit up so it’s not a big issue. After all when you are the user you really don’t look at yourself unless you are streaming live with face view and you want that extra flare.Only issue I had which isn’t a big issue is the mute for the mic isn’t easily accessible and the switch is sometimes hard to quickly use when gaming. For those times when you want to be muted so others don’t hear every background noise or family talking. So I find myself trying to switch between mute while playing which is hard when you are playing FPS games and in an intense section. But that might be me not able to multitask that quickly lol I just wished the mute button was a button possibly or the slide switch it does has was higher up the flush so you aren’t stumbling trying to slide (plus it doesn’t really feel like it slides all the way so you are double checking) I know I went into depth of the issue but it isn’t a huge issue. Just my input maybe when they decide to make another model they can put that into consideration.Overall love it! Going to buy a couple more for our gaming family.,2021,08
"I'm happy with this purchase, love the look of the headphones and enjoy the lights even though I can't really see them myself, I enjoy the fact that they are there and that people that walk into the room can see them. The headphones work great, nice sound quality. Good purchase.",2021,08
These worked for exactly 1 month.  Return window closed the day the headset failed.,2021,08
He uses it with his Xbox controller and has to “hold it a certain way” to get it to work,2021,08
"I ordered this product on a lightening deal. It came broken, left ear piece did not work. Mic after using twice did not work either.The cord is ultra long, made for PC gaming. It only lights up with the USB plug-in, meaning PC gaming & NOT console.I returned for a full refund within a week and actually have been getting by with the console stock headset. I suggest looking elsewhere, the deal isn’t worth you asking for twenty+ minutes, “can you hear me now?” for the second day in a row before giving up. Save yourself the time and go spend an extra whatever to get it done better.",2021,08
We connected correctly & would not work after multiple attempts. Came broken.,2021,08
Do not buy if your playing on PS4,2021,05
"Great price for what you get. Not upset with the product at all. The headphones are not good for what I wanted, which is high quality sound/mic. Ended up going with the Corsair HS60Haptics and am thoroughly impressed. As I said, general gaming for kids... Great product. Higher end gaming/streaming for avid gamers? Spend elsewhere.",2021,08
I got these for my step daughter she really likes them a lot they are very comfortable and she says she's been able to wear them for up to 2-3hrs with no issues A++,2021,08
Amazijg at all. I live with my roommates but I could focus on my own stuff with this headset! Thank you!,2021,08
"I've now bought 2 of these headsets, both had mic failure after only a couple hours of use. Spend the money on something of higher quality.",2021,08
"It comes already big. Doesn’t really fit well, the cables are to short for spreading. Requires you to plug into the console to use the LED lights. Wasn’t pleased. But the sound, quality, and noise cancellation works great!!",2021,08
"It's comfy, has decent volume and controls, but doesn't last a full year.",2021,08
Once I followed the instruction for Xbox to turn up my media in the home menu it was the best pair of headohines I had just wish they were wireless however cord is long enough to anywhere with you,2021,08
They are great,2021,08
Great,2021,08
My nephew says they're the best. He loves how comfy they are and how clear the microphone/headphone is when playing online with his friends,2021,08
Great for gaming my son loves them,2021,08
"When my friend received the headset, the jack is bent. So now how has to adjust the port and not plug it all the way to hear both side of the headphone.",2021,08
"I liked the fact that it actually worked, it's not just like these cheap plastic headphones. I would suggest some work on the wiring though.",2021,08
Bought two of these and one broke after 2 weeks sadly,2021,08
These work great for gaming.  I  can easily tell what direction sounds are coming from in CoD and Apex Legends.  For first person shooter games these work great and are very comfortable.,2021,08
Mic threshold is awful,2021,08
bruh this headset worked for a few months then the light started to not work and then my input was all messed up i can get a corsair headset for just 10 dollars more and it would be 10x better,2021,08
"The mic is too soft and my friends say I sound muffled all the time, Its worse than the mic I previously had and I wish I could get a refund but I don't know/have the time to do returns since I am traveling around now.  I messed with my sound settings to try and increase the volume but It didn't change anything.",2021,08
"Update - the company contacted me and sent me a new headphone with mic. It arrived a few days ago and it works. They mentioned they are sourcing their mic parts from a new supplier. Hopefully, their quality will improve.My son used this for a few hours each week for 2 months. Then, the microphone quit working. The product has a pathetic useful life. Put your dollars towards another headset. This one is worthless.",2021,08
"Would have liked better sound quality. Didn’t work in my gaming chaa du air , which was a big letdown. Recorded different ones. much better",2021,08
I use it for my Xbox one and it works great my only complaint is that the cord is really long but I don’t care. 10/10,2021,08
This headset stopped working 2 days after return window. I received them on July 16 stopped working August 17th. I do not recommend this product. The mic cuts in and out and the sound is full of static.,2021,08
This product is amazing. The sound is really clear. The design make you look like a pro gamer. This headphone is flexible and it has the cushion for your head. The previous ones I own are kinda rigid so it normally broke near areas bending occurs. One thing I'm not a fan of is where the headphone volume controller is placed. Also the headphone volume controller can sometimes makes the sound off like the left side is a little louder then the right side.,2021,08
I brought it as a gift!It light up blueLight weight on the earsGreat sound,2021,08
One problem I have with these is that the cord that plugs into my controller is so stiff with no flexibility that it wants to break.,2021,08
Really good,2021,08
Great for the cost.,2021,08
"Perfect for gaming, lightweight and good quality.",2021,08
These worked great for a month. We received them on June 22nd and they stopped working by august 15th. I was attempting to contact the seller and I can not for any reason get in touch with them. Do not buy.,2021,08
Make sure to fix your settings on your system,2021,08
Use these everyday. Considering another set to gift.,2021,08
:(,2021,08
When I opened the box for my head set and pulled my headset out I noticed that the wire was cut so I couldn’t hear anything.,2021,08
"I bought 3 headsets. Blue,White,and red. Within the first 2 weeks i started having problems it sounded very static. The next thing you know it officially stopped working. Waste of time and money.",2021,08
I really enjoyed this headset when i need another one this one i will buy,2021,08
Great product for the price!! Would definitely recommend it!,2021,08
My son loves them he says and it's much quieter now also for me n my wife😴😴😴,2021,08
They look cool but the volume doesn’t go high enough,2021,08
i thought this headset worked great up until it constantly disconnected from the controller and i have to position it over and over again. it’s so annoying. don’t even think abt buying this.,2021,08
It's great as I am able to hear my buddies and don't have to hear my sisters talking. Mostly to play on my PS4.,2021,08
My daughter uses it to play Nintendo switch and she loves headset,2021,08
All I can say is really good for the price 100% Would recommended!,2021,08
Affordable and does a good job,2021,08
"The mic is really great and has good sound quality i was amazed that it was as good as it is for the price you pay for it, but the only downside to it is the mic doesn’t have the clearest of sound and you kinda sound like you’re in a box, but i would recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a cheap mic with great sound quality.",2021,08
I bought this for my son and the microphone didn’t work. What a disappointment!Update*The headset works good. I initially gave it 1 star thinking it didn’t work. We just found out it was my sons controller with the problem. Luckily we kept the headset and tried it on a new controller and it works great.,2021,08
This is how the box looked at my door. Not in a box just the product box all smashed and bent. Looks like it was used. Was supposed to be a gift but now am embarrassing to give it to them..,2021,08
Didn’t even work properly when we opened it.,2021,08
"Needed a temporary set of headphones, and they do not work with my ps4 controller. i don't care about the lights (which need to be connected via usb), but the audio does not work with my ps4. works perfectly fine on my laptop but not on my ps4 which is extremely annoying.",2021,08
"2 minutes in game and I'm already impressed.lightweight, comfortable and 3d surround sound.i bought these to use for my PS4 and when you swing a melee weapon you can literally hear it move from one side of the screen to the other.",2021,08
The price was great and it works awesome.,2021,08
"My nephew got a pair of these last Christmas and loved them so, I bought him a pair to have at home too.",2021,08
Love,2021,08
This is our second headset for our family. Headsets work great. If we ever need another one we will buy this one.,2021,08
"they didn’t work, they aren’t loud and they are really confusing to use! but too priority is the fact that they are not remotely loud or noise canceling .. they don’t work",2021,08
I bought 2 of these for my kids. The one thing that attracted me most was the LED lights. Once we noticed how it works and how SHORT the cord is I was disappointed. I’m keeping it because they still like it. But now I have to look for a USB extension to see if that helps and I could feel better about the product.,2021,08
"When this stops working looks like you’re stuck. No offer on replacement. Just purchased and already busted. DO NOT BUY!!! Seriously not a bot. Real review. Don’t listen to the 5 star reviews. Not noise cancelling, mic doesn’t work, not even good sound quality. - well only bright side is if you write s bad review THEN they’ll refund you. This is the only reason i moved this from a 1 star to 3. Still don’t recommend purchasing",2021,08
Very good quality and comfortable,2021,08
"EDIT: If you amplify the sound using a 3rd party software, this addresses the issue. The headset is good for its price.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The headset mic is barely audible when connected to PC. I have tried updating the driver, disabling other devices, following the cookie cutter instructions in the manual and nothing has improved the mic situation. If you read the other responses to the first question for this product, you will see others have also had mic problems. This headset is false marketing and criminal, the mic basically does not work.Additionally, the USB light up is ridiculous and an absolute waste of space. I initially thought it served as an audio/USB connection but this is not the case.The sound quality is not bad and they are comfortable, but the whole point for me was to buy a headset with a mic. I am highly disappointed.",2021,08
"I been cheap with my headsets but I been looking for one to replace one that I broke and paid a lot of money for, this one is really good if you play COD loek me its important to hear where the footsteps and coming from well here you go this is the best headset you will get for the reasonable price",2021,08
Bought as a gift for someone and they absolutely loved it. She said they work better then the ones she paid over $60 for,2021,08
"This headset is a extremely good headset. I has comfort in the ear pieces, it glows and that just makes them cooler, lol, they have great sound, come with a great microphone. I literally have no complaints about the headset. I ended up returning them because I needed something smaller and more dainty for my work from home job being that I am required to wear a headset each working day for 8 plus hours a day.",2021,08
perfect for my 14 year old for gaming....,2021,08
I like them. I feel like I'm really in the game,2021,08
As the title says,2021,08
This was not a easy hook up you have to do to much to connect to game and to get them to work just went to game stop and brought 2 different ones my kids wanted to play there games,2021,08
Producers started out great. Then 2 months in and the mic stopped working and headset stopped connecting to the Xbox. Waste of money.,2021,08
I have no regrets or complaints about this item,2021,08
mic is too far from mouth and not adjustable,2021,08
Super good 👍,2021,08
Perfect for my son! I didn’t want anything too expensive because he destroys everything but he hasn’t managed to ruin these yet!,2021,08
"The mic quality is ok it’s not the best, and the sound quality is pretty good!",2021,08
My son absolutely loves it. I have been amazed by how great they are. Great sound.,2021,08
All went well with the first day of use!,2021,08
"These are pretty great, the mic works well and there are no problems with the audio. Now it's been a few months and they are still working the same. It even looks good.",2021,08
Quality for the price paid,2021,08
"I bought it on June 22nd, it's August 6th and the microphone stopped working. The return date was July 23rd, I have been trying to contact the seller and no success.",2021,07
Sound is great,2021,07
This is a def noise cancellation. I’m always in a full house and I was happy not to hear noise,2021,07
"My son loves them for gaming! No complaints from him, only have to get louder so that he can hear me if he’s playing with them on lol.",2021,07
"I got the purple ones for when I’m playing PS4. I was excited for them to light up but they don’t, they only light up for PC. Other than that they’re good for gaming, pretty comfortable. I expected them to light up no matter what console is used, I’d return them to find better but I might as well keep them.",2021,07
My grandson was so excited over his new headphones.  Told me I was the best GIGI in the world!!,2021,07
See above,2021,07
Says it works with Xbox 1 in the headline and (maybe) somewhere buried in the description says it needs an adaptor. Returning immediately.,2021,07
Product looks as described and is comfortable. However two main features are gonna mark this one as a return for me. The sound quality is bad for both the incoming and outgoing mic audio. Everything sounds echoey like its in a fish bowl. Also the mute function does not work. Game audio itself is fine but not great but i got these for chatting and wont be able to use it this way. Pay more get more I suppose.,2021,07
My grandson wanted this for his birthday and he was very happy with it,2021,07
Great sound for the price the only thing that stinks you got to have the USB plug in for the headphones to light up other then that it won’t light up but the headphones still work,2021,07
"Not really worth it since the extra wires get in the way, if your buying for xbox or playstation it’s terrible because not only do the lights not work but you need to plug the usb into your consol, without a plug for the usb it just gets extremely annoying to use, the sound quality’s okay for the price.",2021,07
They look cool but are for a child or a person with small ears had to take them off and go back to my old ones after 10 min,2021,07
"While I was excited about the headset's sound quality, I could not wear it for more than a few minutes. It is extremely tight. As a result, it kept pressing on my glasses, shifting them around whenever I moved my head. Additionally, it pressed tightly on my earring, which became painful very quickly.If you have neither glasses nor earrings, I guess this is a good option.",2021,07
It's nice and fits nicely the only thing I wish was better was how long the USB cable was to power the lights on it,2021,07
The red lights on these headsets are wickedly cool!!!,2021,07
Very cheap plastic and horrible mic. Not usable. Returning.,2021,07
Bought these to cancel out the loud music coming from my neighbors house.. and also my neighbor.. they work perfectly. Sometimes I forget I have them on.,2021,07
"Overall the set is fine, nothing ridiculous. You get what you pay for pretty much. Just needed a fair-priced pair to replace my blown out ones. Perhaps my biggest gripe about this product is that the volume knob is a total joke; there is very little range on the adjustment to the volume compared to how much the knob is able to turn. On the way to turning it up the majority of the time you’re turning the knob your volume is not adjusting. The range feels like it begins and ends within less than a third of the knob’s ability to turn in the “volume increase” direction.",2021,07
I wouldn’t buy this headset simply because the mic on it picks up little sound and you have to be very loud to get good quality,2021,07
As described,2021,07
Terrible it didn't work out the box bad product smh,2021,07
Don’t waste the time on this product. Yes the sound works and is okay but the mic came broken straight out the box.Don’t let the thousands of reviews fool ya,2021,07
"Very bright, sound quality and feedback is on point, no lagging voices. I recommend.",2021,07
Son uses for gaming and watching school videos and listening to audio books.Says they are very comfortable - don't hurt his ears.Sound quality is great.Dual plugs/adapters means he can use them with a laptop or his mp3 player.Can't beat the quality for the price.,2021,07
They are uncomfortable after about 30 minutes if you have glasses,2021,07
The light didn’t pop up when I plugged in in the controller.,2021,07
Terrible,2021,07
Worth it if you need a cheap pair,2021,07
Just wished it’ll light up without being plugged in,2021,07
"Sound quality is too good, I can’t hear myself think ;)",2021,07
Bought this for my 10 year old. It actually came with the double chord for PCs which my sons laptop didn’t need but I know some others do need it. So far it’s working fine.,2021,07
When I use the headset and I touch the part with the mute button and the volume wheel I can’t hear anything.,2021,07
My grandson really enjoys it.,2021,07
Great gift for 11 year old grandson!!!,2021,07
This is the 3rd set I've had to purchase for my son in the last year.  We kept buying the cheap headsets and they would all last a couple months before the mic would quit working or the audio quality became really bad.  Finally broke down and bought him a nicer more expensive set and so far they are amazing at the quality and tech that is in those things.,2021,07
I was trying to play the ps4 with my friend but I couldn’t here him and he couldn’t here me.,2021,07
"I did a lot of research, on Amazon, looking for a new (cheaper) gaming headset for my son. He seems to have the worst luck when it comes to cheaper gaming headsets but I guess you get what you pay for. However, with these, they work great. Sound quality is good, voice and mute work good. The lights do not light up unless you have the USB cord connected to another source. My son uses his for the PS4, so no lights for us. Doesn’t really matter though since he cannot see the lights anyway! They work and that’s what matters most! The extra connector does come in the box.",2021,07
it's cool i guess,2021,07
Exactly what I was looking for! Great quality and sound,2021,07
"I got these from my brother as a Christmas gift this past year, and I really like them. I don’t use them a lot because my current computer doesn’t function well (it’s also very cheap and old) and sometimes the audio likes to pop because of that, but other than that, I love them.",2021,07
its honestly so good,2021,07
Mic did not work,2021,07
"These headphones have really good sound quality, especially for the price.",2021,07
I bought these for my daughter forHer Nintendo switch. She loves them,2021,07
I like my headset and for that price you can’t beat it,2021,07
These headphones are great for gaming with my friends. I like that the microphone folds up and it works perfectly with my ps4. I would say that the passive noise cancellation is just due to the thick memory foam earmuffs which are nice but wanted to make it clear that they aren't active noise cancellation headphones.,2021,07
"Awesome product, sound quality amazing",2021,07
Absolute garbage.,2021,07
Was really clear,2021,07
So I really like these head phones :)  I travel alot and they are useful on my switch and my phone.  My tv still has headphone jack so I can use it there too and then gaming on the computer too it's wonderful.  Headphones need to be made like this.  I've fallen asleep with them on and they have not been damaged :o,2021,07
Only worked for a week,2021,07
Not bad for the price. I like it,2021,07
"Bought this because it was suggested for its comfort, it said people with larger heads could wear it without the infamous head pinch. Was a snug fit for me, felt the pinch and the ear cups were too small. I was going to disregard it since it was fairly cheap. But then I tested it out... one of the headphones didn't work. And yeah, I made sure it wasn't on mono the the L and R were on and balanced.Returned.",2021,07
"These do not fit on the head well. my head falls under the ""size fits most"" category in terms of hats, glasses, and headsets. This does not. additionally, they do not cancel any noise at all. Finally, the one i received had to have the mic put right to my mouth to pick up any sounds, no matter how much i played around with the settings. I understand that this is a cheap pair, but that doesnt mean that the product shouldnt work. Sound quality is alright.",2021,07
"Crap.  Item did not work.  I can hear, but can not be heard.  Item does not light up (not sure it's supposed to).  Didn't realize no returns.  I'm a sucker",2021,07
Pretty good sound and audio quality for the price. Fits well and can wear for long periods of time.,2021,07
It a great product when you evaluate price and quality.,2021,07
These do not work for what I needed them for. We bought them to plug into a PS4 controller and they do not connect.,2021,06
"IMHO, I think these are the best headphones for the price. They are extremely durable and can withstand many drops without a problem. My grandpa got them for me and I love them! They even come with a usb cable for LED lights and an adapter to be able to use the microphone and headphones at the same time. The headphone mic quality is actually really good for any type of work or gaming. So in my opinion, this product has a five star rating.",2021,07
Good product my son loves it,2021,07
Might just me my pc or Xbox but the mic was very quiet for everyone on the discord call and Xbox party,2021,07
Only used 2-3 times before they stopped working,2021,07
I don’t like the fact that the mic doesn’t work,2021,07
Not great... they don't really fit snug on your ears. No noise cancelation. Not very loud for gaming. Mic works good.. light is cool. Probably good for kids. I thought it was a good deal on decent set.. but really they are just $16 headset. Ill.be returning them as they were not what I was expecting or hoping for and don't fit.,2021,07
They are decent but very uncomfortable.,2021,07
"Got these as an intended upgrade for a previous 15$ headset I got from Walmart. I wasn't expecting much, but I wish I had kept the Walmart headset now that I've tested these. They work just fine for video playback, no real complaints there. My main issues are how incredibly cheap they feel and how crummy the microphone is. The store page claims it has noise isolation to better pick up your voice, but from my basic voice recording tests comparing my laptop and this microphone, my laptop consistently provides louder, clearer results compared to this headset. There was still quite noticeable background noise in the headset's recording as well. There's also some design flaws with how the microphone is implemented; it is a completely rigid peice of plastic that only rotates vertically, so it just ends up hanging a good 5 to 6 inches from your mouth when deployed (yes, I got out a ruler and measured. It's that off). This is compared to other headset mics which can be adjusted as needed to sit much closer, and in front of your mouth instead of beside it.The cheap feeling is the next biggest flaw. Simply put, the glossy plastic used on the exterior of the muff housing reminds me of a cheap toy. The case on the connecting band is a bit better, being made from matte plastic, but not by much. The only things on this device that don't feel like they were slapped together for as low a material cost as possible are the ear mouths and the braided cord, which comes with nice plastic protectors for both the 3.5mm audio jack and the usb that powers the contractually obligated ""Gamer"" lights. I'd have honestly forgone the lights for better build quality on the muff housing, and a microphone that's actually somewhat flexible so I can actually hear myself speak.Overall:-Average playback quality. Nothing that would impress an audiophile, but nowhere near terrible. It's painfully average (and unfortunately that's more than can be said for the rest of the device).-Bad microphone design and quality. Just... don't bother. I got better results from the built in microphone array in my Thinkpad w530 from 2012 than I did with this thing.-El cheapo feel. Like a toy from a dollar store.Verdict:If you care about quality in your headset?Don't buy this. They sell this thing for 50$ at regular price. I got it for about half off with the amazon prime discount. Even still, I somewhat regret spending money on this thing, and I'd be leagues more disappointed had I paid the full asking price for it. It's barely worth it's weight at 25ish dollars, and there's no way it's worth the normal 50.If you just want something for discreet audio playback?Go find a better headset, or just settle for some earbuds. There's plenty of decent options for the latter under 20$ both in retail stores and online. This one isn't worth your time or your money. The only reason I'm even keeping this is because returning products has always been a pain in my experience, and because the headset itself technically works. But that's it. It's not even worth the hassle of chasing down a refund.",2021,07
I got them for my son birthday he love them,2021,07
Great product for gaming at a great price,2021,07
Awesome headset. Very sleek style and the noise canceling is amazing.,2021,07
"This was gift for 10 yr. Old great nephew , he loves it !  Good purchase !",2021,07
"I bought this for gaming with friends on PS4 and for the first few days it worked fine. But after that the sound quality just got really bad and it started noticing some of the flaws which just proved to me how cheaply made they were. If you don’t mind that they’ll be alright for the price, but for me and many others it’ll hardly be worth it.",2021,07
Please for the love of god don’t waste your money on this headset. Mic quality is terrible and audio cuts in and out straight out of the box. Spend the extra $20 and get a mic that is worth it.,2021,07
The mic doesn't work after a week,2021,07
"The microphone doesn't work at all for my PC. I've trouble shot the issue per their online instructions and my computers specific instructions. It doesn't pick the mic up at all. Now, I will say, the sound quality of the head phones is great and they're super comfy. But, if you get them for gaming, it seems like there's a 50/50 chance that they'll do what they're supposed to.",2021,07
Yes i would,2021,07
Good,2021,07
liked everything about this headset.  Great sound.,2021,07
"Feels like you can’t turn it up loud enough for some games, could be a decibel limiter; the bass is usually overpowered but not a terrible product, treble is good quality but a bit on the quiet side.",2021,07
Bought them for my 16yo to use.  He hasnt complained yet so I guess they're good,2021,07
Great for gaming,2021,07
It was a great present for a friend of mine because while gaming he couldn't talk because his old expensive headset broke fast. So far it's been a few months and this still works for him. He sounds better and the quality is also good. I'm not sure how noise cancelation is going for him though.,2021,07
Boys use these for fort nite and they work great they are not to heavy what so ever and that has been my challenge I recommend these if u have kids 10 and under,2021,07
Microphone does not work. Followed all instructions for set-up and troubleshooting. Still does not work.,2021,07
"Horrible quality but I’m not surprised for the price. The LED lights only are on when it’s charging, the volume is so low when it’s all the way high. Definitely can’t wait to return it",2021,07
My son loves it great product.,2021,07
I use this on my Xbox one s. They are too quiet to hear well. They take a lot enjoyment out of the game.,2021,07
"Okay, so for this to work on PC apparently you have to have a mic and headphone jack. No laptops have microphone jacks.This product is essentially useless. Do not purchase it.",2021,07
I even purchased new controllers.  They went dead after 2-3 weeks.,2021,07
It's very good had for about 4 months and has not had a problem the volume and sound allow for me to hear enemy foot steps. The sound nob is a good addition so if you are in game you can change the volume without going in and out of the game menu.,2021,07
love the colors,2021,07
Stand breaks to easily.  Would probably not make a purchase from this company again,2021,07
It’s not the best nor the worst. It’s just ok.,2021,07
"Works great, sounds great.",2021,07
Only issue was the ear hole are a touch small but if you adjust enough they will cover them.,2021,07
Thank you ❤️❤️,2021,07
"The sound is fine for the money but the microphone is really bad. We had to go into the sound settings and turn up the gain a ton just to make it to where people could here the user on comms. Thus, the sound quality is garbage with all the background noise.",2021,06
Great headset for the money,2021,06
"I ordered two pairs of these headphones, one for me and another for my brother. Not even two weeks and they've already ran their course.At first they were a bit tight on the head, enough to give headaches if not removed after a few hours. This eventually eased up as the first week went on.The real issue came in for us 13 days after first using them. Like many others have been saying here, one day the mic was fine, and the next day all of a sudden its quality was way lower than what it was prior. Audio then coming through lot more stuffy, and the mic having a hard time picking up any sounds at all. Only when I cranked up the decibel settings to max it was able to pick up feint sounds. One of them still works fine on our Xbox, but when it comes to PC they're both on the way out already.Will most definitely be looking elsewhere for our tech needs in the future.",2021,07
"This headset is the worst for gaming. no stereo, so there is no difference if the enemy is on the right or left, you can hear it as one sound.  the noise cancellation is amazing to the point you are screaming just so people can hear you talking normal. sound quality is OK besides that. useless hanging USB plug for lights. I don't have a small head and don't have a huge head and it slides down off my ears after some time. it's snug for about an hour. super light weight plastic junk. when I received them I thought what was in the box was a pack of 100 masks. wait and save your money and buy something that is actually worth your money for years to come.",2021,07
"They are comfortable, but in the picture it show that they light up. They do NOT son was upset",2021,07
"Nery Nice.. Incredible for the Price.  Fits Snugg to the head and ears.. Very nice sound, and Good Mic.. Very surprised for the Price of 19.99 ( Blue )  ( I bought 2)",2021,07
"I think that for the price it was, its extremely good! if your looking for a cheaper headset to do the exact same as an expensive headset, i recommend this one! very good noise cancelation as well",2021,07
Ok,2021,07
"I had to return the first pair I bought because the microphone didn’t work. The second set microphone only works sometimes, which frustrates my son to no end. The headphone portion works just fine, though, and they look good.",2021,07
You can hear a buzzing noise when plugged in and people can’t hear you all they hear is a echo when you try to talk. This mike is over all trash,2021,07
Great quality for a low price .. better than some of my friends expensive sets,2021,07
Only works when you plug into usb. Not just the controller.,2021,07
"They were surprisingly good quality. I baught them with the intention of using them for console game, so it's a little difficult to use the LEDs, and the work great.",2021,07
You get a very good quality mic for $20. Solid all around and the sound/noise cancellation was better than I expected. Only problem is the mic isn’t that maneuverable and sometimes my friends can’t hear me that good when I have it close to my mouth,2021,07
"I bought these for my daughter, they worked well for the first 2 months and then suddenly the sound quality became choppy and distorted.... unable to use them. Waste of money",2021,07
"I got these delivered the same day I purchased them. Straight out of the box, and I mean STRAIGHT out of the box… the headphones on work on the left side. The right side had no sound… and the microphone doesn’t work.. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Garbage. Would leave no stars if applicable",2021,07
Plugged right into my PS4 controller and works exceptionally well. If I’m being 100% honest these are just as good as the $80 pair I was gifted that broke (which is why I purchased these) and eventually when these wear out I will be repurchasing them. Can’t beat the price for the great quality.,2021,07
My son loves the headset and they are comfortable.,2021,07
Did not tell us we needed adapter when we ordered it. Was not compatible alone for Xbox. Not cool.,2021,07
Really like the feel of them and they look amazing Bt can’t glow with usb plug-in unless u sit directly in front of your game system,2021,07
Trash for PS4 doesn’t even fit all the way in to the controller and you might be wondering why are plunging it into the controller cause the damn thing for the PS4 for itself doesn’t event work,2021,07
Never worked.  Returned,2021,07
"Not 100% noise cancelation, but is fine, a litter heavy, I used for online class, working for me, I like it! Recommended",2021,07
My friends say they hear a little static when I speak but not much more than another mic around the same price.  It's what I expected. Decent sound.,2021,07
Perfect for gaming and noise cancellation,2021,07
Perfect for any gamer and price is great!,2021,07
The team has been great working in their communications with customers. I highly recommend their products. I brought some for my brothers,2021,07
Very good for price!,2021,07
It doesn’t work,2021,06
"It’s very confortable when wearing over your ears, the noise canceling is effective, and it plugs into my computer easily.",2021,06
Worth the money just doensnt. Light up,2021,06
"Mic has always been quiet, but after a few months the mic stopped working at all.",2021,06
Bought this headset in February '21 and it stopped working/no sound comes through the headset at all in April '21 but my son didn't tell me about it until July 1st '21. He used it for his PS4.,2021,06
"A bit heavy and awkward, but I would expect that at this price point. My only real complaint is in the cord design. I am using with PS4 and the cord splits in 2. One is a 3.5mm jack that plugs into the controller and supplies the sound, which works fine. The other is a USB jack that supplies power to the LED lights and should plug into the console. The problem is that the cord splits at the last 6 inches or so. If you want to use the USB for the lights, you need to either buy a separate USB extension or keep your controller at least 6 inches from your console, which is very impractical, if not impossible. Just bad design. It should split much further up the cord so that both can plug in to their appropriate places at the same time.I had 3 stars, but lowered to 2 because I don't like companies that offer money for reviews. They've been sending incessant emails saying they will refund $20 if I remove my review. How about you just make a decent product? My integrity can't be bought for $20!",2021,07
Liked the color,2021,07
"Bought for Grandaughter, she loves them for her gaming, never takes them off. (Because she is always gaming)  fresh air anyone?",2021,07
Great product for the price and for a 7 year old. Very durable.,2021,07
My grand son love the head phoneAnd love the color,2021,07
"Headset worked fine for one month, and I’ve had it for 6+ months and it’s cutting in and out consistently. Not only the mic in parties but the speakers as well. I bought a hyperX 3+ years ago and it still works with little to no issues still. I DO NOT understand why the reviews for this product are so good, you tend to trust so many 5 star reviews but, I’m very upset with it. the worst part is I can’t get a refund at this point so it was a BIG WASTE OF MONEY.UPDATE: it broke 3 weeks after this review was posted",2021,07
Found out that this product does not work with computers. I can hear everything just fine but people can't hear me which defeats the purpose of having a headset,2021,07
"Best headset we have had so far. Durable, microphone works well. They are comfortable.",2021,07
This was a gift.... he likes them.... I wasn’t sure it would work with a Nintendo Switch.... but it does,2021,07
"USB doesn’t go all the way into the port, it doesn’t work at all. The headphone jack works for controllers but the microphone sounds like garbage. It sounds staticky and muffled.",2021,07
"Cheap Plastic breaks!  Very poor design Penny wise hundred stupid. Return games with UPS. Gas burned life wasted heartbroken birthday gift paper wasted, stress! The arm holing microphone moveable to adjust. Snapped off was taped on better and stronger then the whole thing combined. looks great blue lights!  NOT!",2021,07
The sound is great we were very happy until the microphone stopped working . Now useless for gaming not happy !!,2021,07
"There's really no downside to this headset. It's comfortable, fits snug around my ears instead of squishing them. The sound is amazing. The microphone moves smoothly and sends clear audio. It also just looks nice.",2021,07
Great,2021,07
Paid $84.99 for the Razer BlackShark V2 Gaming Headset 6 months ago and the mic doesn't work most of the time (specifically while playing Fortnite on PS4). Paid $19.99 for this BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset and the speakers and mic sound and work fantastic. Don't pay more!,2021,07
Sound quality is good mic doesn’t work. Decent pair of headphones.,2021,07
My son saved up bought them on prime day could not be happier,2021,07
boys love for gaming and say it works well.,2021,07
"I bought these for me and my boyfriend since we video call a lot. They are really good quality sound, distance background noise but doesn't silence it (which I like). Looks pretty cool. However I am returning them bc my boyfriend doesn't like the extra usb cord for the light and it's too bulky for his liking after seeing them in person. I saw complaints about the mic, it works pretty well, you just have to turn the volume up sometimesThe reason I deducted 2 stars was because I got those for my phone and you can't use them unless you take off the case, the metal is not long enough otherwise",2021,07
These headphones worked for about a week and then quit. I checked all the settings on my Xbox 1 and still could not get them to work. Not happy.,2021,07
Works really well.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a love of gaming or likes to listen to music.,2021,07
"There's almost no noise cancellation you're friends are going to hear your games over your mic. The headset is also super uncomfortable and awkward, sound quality is of course really mediocre",2021,07
For 20$ it's pretty good,2021,07
Order my fourth pair all three pair of blue ones head phone jack has a shortage in them once u take them out the box and cause sound to go in and out. The last pair I order I returned for another pair and just got them yesterday and they are doing the same thing. So I’m going to return them for my money back. I think it is bad business.,2021,07
"I am writing the review on behalf of the comments made by my grandson. He stated they are stellar, feel so comfortable on, the microphone works excellent. He said he could hear things perfectly and keep the outside noise out. The look is awesome! He is happy to have upgraded to this headset. I was very happy with the price and quality. Would I buy them again? Most definitely, and I highly recommend for their performance, price, and look of this headset.",2021,07
I bought these head phones for my 12 year old Grandson and he loves them!  He loves the noise canceling feature and the lighting up in blue is an extra bonus!,2021,07
Works great. Son loves it,2021,06
The microphones too quiet,2021,06
"A pretty decent headset. I bought this headset having very very high hopes for the mic specifically, since my audio hadn't been the best just through my laptop microphone. But after using this headset for a month or two, I have realized that the mic isnt actually that great. It is mediocre at best, and it commonly cuts out in voice calls. The headset audio quality itself is honestly pretty good. The mute and volume wheel were very convenient, and you could really make your audio very loud with the volume wheel, which was a plus. I will say though that the led lights on the headset wont light up unless you plus the usb jack in, which was a big inconvenience for me when I was still using a wired mouse, and after reading the reviews they rarely add that note but maybe I just forgot to check the slides when buying. This headset is also very VERY bulky which is a personal ick for me when buying headsets, its definitely not for a minimalistic look, but I will say this is just a personal preference. Overall, its a mediocre headset. Since its only 20$ you get what you pay for but theres definitely better headsets out there for the same price. Or save up just a bit more money for a highquality medium-priced headset like the razer kraken x, steelseries arctics 1, or hyperx cloud alpha headset.",2021,07
good headset works as expected confortable support…wish the usb part was longer so it could go into my ps4 other then that works great,2021,07
Worst sounding headphones I have ever used,2021,07
Money well spent. I love that the cable is thick and less likely to break and the sounds quality is top notch. Definitely recommend for gamers or even if you wanna listen to music and tune the world out.,2021,07
"It barely works when you just plug the aux in, but when you plug the usb or the mic in it's low volume... if it works... It won't output to the right audio setting or something... idk. I've troubleshooted it for too long, I'm giving up.",2021,07
"I bought it for my grandson, he was so excited and loves it. He says that the sound is clear.",2021,07
Super comfortable except does not work for call center agents on computers,2021,07
Great quality headset and sound! Lights are bright my boys age 6 and 9 years old likes it,2021,07
My son uses it for his Nintendo Switch I loves it!,2021,07
Its nice,2021,07
"Perfect for gaming,  My grandson loved this gift!",2021,07
Good sound quality and durable,2021,07
"No sound canceling, these are just regular headphones. The audio jack is weirdly thicker than it should be so hard to plug into things and very snug when you do. They’re very light and cheap but you get what you pay for. If you want gaming headphones look elsewhere, if you just need headphones with a mic these are technically fine.",2021,06
Gift my son is a gamer,2021,06
Felt awful on my head and just cheap plastic,2021,06
Sound isn't that great. Rather unimpressed.  Should have spent more money and bought better.,2021,06
Daughter loves this for playing online.,2021,06
It doesn’t work,2021,06
The headphones were not clear enough for me to hear words.,2021,06
Sounds quality is trash. You can barely hear the game. The mic is also terrible. Everyone is saying I sound muffled. Will never buy from this company again.,2021,06
It just dosen't work,2021,06
Great for watching Movies. :-),2021,06
Was a gift and he likes it very much.,2021,06
"Only the mic worked.  It did not pay any audio or music.  And the mic sounded extremely staticky.  I would not recommend.They finally got back to me and are sending me a new one so I will increase the stars because of their customer service, if the next one doesn’t work then I’ll go back down to a lower store",2021,06
Very good quality,2021,06
Thanks,2021,06
LOVE THESE!!!! HIGH QUALIT FOR A AFFORDABLE PRICE!!!,2021,06
Not good at all,2021,06
Really good sound quality! Comfortable for hours because the ear pieces fit over the entire ear instead of squishing it down.,2021,06
Stopped working after 2 days.,2021,06
Idk about sound cancelling but my son hasn’t complained about it. He’s into gaming and animations. KingFuture001 is his name.,2021,06
Excelente!,2021,06
Kid loves them,2021,06
"Bought for my great grandson, he loves them",2021,06
"Quality, sound, lighting and comfy to use",2021,06
Awesome,2021,06
The headset works great and looks awesome.,2021,06
great,2021,06
They’re great!,2021,06
"I got this as a gift and the mic is super sensitive I love it, great quality. I kinda wish I could turn off the lights sometimes, they're super bright",2021,06
It's a good headset.  Comfortable.  Nice volume control on the cable.  Cable is a nice long length.,2021,06
They are exactly what we were looking for. They are heavy duty which is exactly what my teenage boys need!,2021,06
At full volume the in game sound is still not the loudest. for the price it’s a good headset that will last a while.,2021,06
They worked great - for two months - then the mic went out . Boo!,2021,06
I didn’t buy it for gaming but I love it.,2021,06
i love this mic the noise cancellation is awesome the sound is awesome and it’s really cheap i really recommend it,2021,06
"Good headphones for the price but really crappy switch. The volume will cut out on one side when you roll up or down, you have to fiddle with it a lot. The mute button is iffy at best.",2021,06
"My kid loves them!!! He was super happy with the fit, look, and sound",2021,06
thank you,2021,06
IT DOES NOT WORK for XBOX LIVE WITHOUT A $50. Adapter. All lies in the description. ALL LIES.,2021,06
"The first headset I received was busted the sound barely worked in only one ear piece. So, I sent it back in for a new one. The return/receiving for the new headset was easy and quick.Now the bad part: The headset is lower quality than the description let on. I felt that the headset sound wasn't the worst, definitely a step up from an earbud headset. The mic, however, doesn't past any quality test of mine. I have always had an easy time of speaking to my team/friends but after getting this they could barely hear me. They described it as if I were across the room trying to speak into the mic (I obviously wasn't). I was disappointed with my purchase. Definitely going to purchase a new headset from a more reputable company.",2021,06
"The headsets volume is terrible and the people you play with will barely be able to hear you even if you max the output volume on it. The sound quality is also terrible as it randomly amplifies certain sounds and makes everyone sound like they are talking into a cup.Overall dont buy this, even though its cheap it is not worth as you wont be able to even function with this hunk of junk.",2021,06
Had headset one day only Mike stopped working sending back to Amazon not happy with purchase,2021,06
This is not a good headset but its only 20 bucks so you get what you pay for.,2021,06
The only way the lights works if you plug into the xbox  port.then there is a 8 inch  cord to plug into the controller for the mic which doesn't  work. Very poor design.,2021,06
We bought our first pair of these and liked them so we decided to buy a second pair. Great quality especially for the price. You plug theae right into your controller. They're also very comfortable!,2021,06
Didn't like the way the package showed up though. It came in the original headphone box so anyone could see it. It was also crushed. Glad the headphones weren't damaged.,2021,06
"This product fits like a dream compared to the Razer Kraken line of headsets. The mic isn't as adjustable, but I prefer a fixed mic as it won't wear as badly, and the mic quality seems comparable if not superior. The cord is high quality, as is the included adapter for being a stock part. They look just as cool as the photos aesthetically as well.",2021,06
Bought it for my husband during Prime days. He uses them for gaming and says they work well.,2021,06
"Great sound, mic not the best and sometimes hard to hear, mute button does clicking sound that the other person can hear every time",2021,06
Son loved them.,2021,06
"They are the worst. The sound is ok, but mic does not work, it sounds like you are underwater when using them.",2021,06
"The headphones arrived very quickly, as someone who has been using them for quite a few months now, they are very durable! I have unfortunately dropped them on the mic a good few times but to all surprise they have held up! Sound quality is good and so is the mic. They do get smudged quite easily though but you get what you pay for. Overall, a solid 4/5 from me!",2021,06
"I do love this product, but I bought it think I had led lights in the ear covers. It does not.",2021,06
This product is very nice!,2021,06
My son likes it!,2021,06
"The quality was great, and everything worked fine. It was very easy to use, but it only worked for about 6 months until the mic stopped working. It seems others had the same issue as well. Not too bad for price though!EDIT: The Microphone started to work again. It occasionally gets spotty and my audio can sound muffled to others, but that's not all the time. The speakers still work great, I can hear clearly.",2021,06
"I originally had rated these lower, because they did not work with our 2 Xbox one controllers after 2 days of using. However after even more fiddling around, we found out we needed to update the controller firmware. Once we did that, the headset worked again!",2021,06
Excelente,2021,06
 Doesn’t light up since I got it and only one headphone work,2021,06
The priced paid for this product and what you receive is amazing.  Thanks for the great product.,2021,06
these headphones are amazing for their price! I have been using them for Fortnite and roblox. the mic works great and the sound quality is overall good. I would highly reccomend for any gamer.,2021,06
This product has to be plugged into the Xbox and controller at the sametime to work. It has about 2 inches of cord making it impossible to play any games.,2021,06
"I bought these because I play RPGs via Discord and wanted a better mic than my Galaxy Buds+ because sometimes they don't pick up my voice. From the very first night I used this headset, people said there was an echo and they could hear themselves on my mic. It was quite distracting, and I ended up having to switch to my earbuds. I thought that was weird, maybe just a problem with Discord? But I would try some solutions and see if I could get them to work.I used them a little since then and no one said anything, but I kept myself muted unless I was actually speaking. Then my boyfriend complained about hearing YouTube through the mic to the point where it was VERY loud for him when I could barely hear the video myself. I wondered if it might be my Macbook Pro. I did some research to see if there was a setting I could change, or anything else to fix the problem. Nothing did.Then I thought about seeing if other people had had the same problem by checking the reviews. After reading them, I'm convinced the headset has an insane amount of noise leakage and is just bad quality all around. I'm starting the process of returning them through Amazon, because I don't have any faith that the seller will respond or offer me any satisfaction. Bring on the cash offers, but this review is going nowhere.",2021,06
Bought here for my son(8)…. He loves them. Lights and mic work great,2021,06
Very nice headset. sounds are great. only thing I don't really like is that the mic isn't adjustable.,2021,06
Great product. My son loves it.,2021,06
Hands down the best headphones I’ve ever used! Can’t beat the incredible price either! RUN.....don’t walk to get yours NOW!!,2021,06
"The pictures are how the product arrived. It Was packaged in a cheap plastic bag and the box was mutated.  This was supposed to be a gift for my son and I didn’t have time to replace it (the delivery was late, which would have been just fine If it didn’t arrive like this). Didn’t work. Not sure If it didn’t work because of the delivery or because of the product. Do not buy this, you will not get what you were expecting.",2021,06
Won't last not even a year this is garbage,2021,06
Great sound quality,2021,06
They have great sound and the mic is clear . I ordered blue and got red but Im still very satisfied . My last headset was about $100 and they did last 5 years but these have much better sound quality.,2021,06
I got this product for my grandson birthday. too play video games.,2021,06
The lights only work if you use the USB plug which is not practical for video consoles like xbox and playstation. Sound quality is pretty good but pretty  standard set of headsets without the light feature.,2021,06
"They were only good for three months, I want refund",2021,06
Stopped working after a month. Should learn my lesson and stop buying from Amazon none of this stuff lasts for very long,2021,06
"Super comfortable, flexible, love everything about them. Only complaint is that they don't light up like they appear to. Otherwise it's a steal!",2021,06
It's hi quality,2021,06
"Bass is good, the cord is long, comfortable for most people, and its pretty solid for gaming. It's pretty awesome, especially for about twenty bucks. worth a try.",2021,06
"Bought in February, already stopped working. I have a headset stand that I place them on when I’m done using so it’s not like they’re tossed aside. And it’s not like I use them every day either.ETA: Customer service sent replacement. Very nice to work with",2021,06
Good value for the money. Sound quality is Ok.  Cord seems ridiculously long but perhaps it’s because it works on the PC too (using for Xbox). Comfortable to wear.  Kind of big in size so if it’s for a kid just know it may be enormous on them.,2021,06
My son is 11 and he has no complaints about this headphone. He said his friends also said they could hear him well and clear.,2021,06
The headphones seem to be well-made and the sound quality is great.  These were bought with the thought that they would be good for working at home but my customers keep saying they can’t hear me.  I would imagine it would be just fine for gaming.,2021,06
"While these headphones offer great value, I would recommend them to anyone but gamers. This is annoying while gaming because they are VERY loose and gets you distracted. Even after putting it on tight most setting, it undoes the setting. I have a rather average-sized head..",2021,06
"best headset for its price . noise cancellation, volume is great, lights up , mic only picks up your voice",2021,06
works on xboxdoes not work on pc or ps4,2021,06
Just couldn’t get the thing to work with both audio and mic at the same time,2021,06
"I would not recommend this product at all. It’s cheap for a reason. It rarely works. While it looks nice its performance is very poor. In each box they’ll include a little flier saying you’ve won a free product. To receive it you need to leave a good review. While they do indeed follow through and give you the product, it’s a harmless scam to get positive reviews for their bad products. Spend the money on a better product.",2021,06
This product doesn't work for the ps4 as described in description,2021,06
All I did was turn the mic and out of nowhere it just broke off,2021,06
"Love it, really fast shipping didn’t even expect to come today",2021,06
Headline says it all.,2021,06
bought for my son to replace another pair.  Works well so far.,2021,06
Everything is good. Best headset,2021,06
My godson loved the headset.,2021,06
"Got 2 of these. They work really well, but it has to be plugged into the usb in order for it to light up which is stupid. You can’t use them on a controller without also plugging the usb into something else. But great for PC.",2021,06
"I used the first pair for 3 years and this is my second pair. I use these for work 4 days a week for 4 hours per day (and I take them off and put them on at least 4 times per shift). So, for the price point, they've done me quite well.",2021,06
"The max volume sounds more like the minimum volume. This is my first purchase for a gaming headset. Maybe this is normal, but I’m not a fan.",2021,06
My 13 lives them ... can't hear me when I call for him lol,2021,06
Decent quality for the price,2021,06
My son love this headphones 🎧.....For gaming.,2021,06
"Very stiff and plasticy, the lights dont work unless you have a bunch of adapters and connecters, mic part broke after couple months.",2021,06
It’s an amazing way to communicate on a game,2021,06
They are awesome and great sound.,2021,06
Update- we were sent a new pair free of charge. It's been 2 days and they still work socthats good. Will update after a couple weeks.Worked for a week and then the plug quit working. You have to twist it back and forth to hear anything. I would not buy again.,2021,06
"They’re uncomfortable, and seem really fragile. The cord looks sturdy in the photo, but is actually somewhat flimsy. They’re not noise canceling either. I tried them as soon as I got them, and it was a big disappointing",2021,06
Not working after just a few months. Would not buy again.,2021,06
"The sound quality is ""ok"", and by that I mean there is some surround sound, left/right, but not so much full directional, and that's pretty important to know.Teammates said mic sounded ok. Downside is the mic is short and stiff, maybe that will protect it better? The mic is adequate and good for the price.Now for the meat of this review... THE EAR COVERS ARE STIFF AND TINY. They wrap around my 3 year olds ears great, not mine though! It's actually PAINFUL to wear these longer than 30 minutes, so don't plan to game long with these. If you have tiny ears, or are under 10 years old, then these are for you. Of you're an adult, move on.I ended up spending 3X more for a Razer Kraken headset and omg let me tell you, for 3X the price I think I got 10X the value. The sound quality of the Razer headset is just miles ahead of these garbage bengoos. You try these trashy bengoos and then try some razer krakens with 7.1 surround and you will blow your mind of the quality difference. Not just in sound quality, but also in build quality, the mic, the comfort of the ear muffs, just wow, I would have paid 10X the price difference if I knew beforehand how big a difference there is between trashy cheap bengoos and actual good quality headsets like Razer... Never going back from Razer, I'll buy them again and again for life now that I know.",2021,06
"Lasted barely two weeks. Wire disconnected from the prong. Lights don't work. Needed a cheap set, well I got it.",2021,06
"Good fit, good sound, plug and play.",2021,06
Bought for use with xbox. Hard to get connected but that blame lies squarely with Microsoft.,2021,06
Perfect for gaming-- I'm a Minecraft Youtuber and these were perfect for my channel they fitted nicely for any size and were adjustable. The sound cancellation was really good I could'nt hear any of the background noise while working. As soon as i put them on I noticed a difference in the sound it was so much nicer and clearer when I had them on. Best headphones out there 100000000000000/10!!!,2021,06
"I have loved their products, mainly the Gaming Headset. they are perdectly listenable and I can play without getting tired.  Also its wireless mouse is better than ever, its design is perfect and it can be seen at night with its lights and everything is perfect. I would  recommend your products to all my friends.",2021,06
It was for my grandsons birthday he loves it. He can’t hear is mother now.,2021,06
"Great headphones! I got this headset for my new remote work at home position. I'm on the phone with clients for many hours at a time. Ear buds were hurting my ears, and trying to talk through the computer speaker was making it hard to hear clients and vice versa. This head set I wore for 6 hours straight and never got a headache and my ears didn't hurt. Clients voices were clear. There's also a volume control wheel on the cord of the headset itself which has been extremely useful for switching between a quiet caller and then a loud caller.",2021,06
Updated:The customer service is amazing and so thanks to them I was able to get a replacement that is much more comfortable and even better sound quality,2021,06
My husband headset he loved them !!!!,2021,06
Really bummed. These seem like really nice headphones but the mic doesn’t work. You can hear fine in them but no one can hear you.,2021,06
For online gaming and streaming,2021,06
Is really comfortable and has a good sound! However the main reason i bought this was for my work from home and i desperately needed a noise cancelling headphones... This simply are not.,2021,06
Noise canceling+Volume could be louder,2021,06
"I have two pairs of these, depending on where I am working that day. I wear them at my desk all day long and use them for conference calls, watching videos, or listening to music. Sound quality is great. They fit great and have all day long comfort. At one point, one of the two broke the day after I first used them. I reached out to the company directly. They were very responsive, and sent me a new pair immediately with no hassle. I would highly recommend these.",2021,06
The headset has a nice feel to it. A comfortable fit as well. The audio is good as well.,2021,06
I have to like speak louder for it pick up on my voice or move my mouth closer to the mic it’s kind of annoying other then that it’s a cool mic and it looks nice the sound quality is pretty good not bad but if ur a more quieter person like me it’s not for u,2021,06
"Extremely disappointed... These are not gaming headphones. You can not hear left from right, it's all mixed together.. quality is bad and I will definitely not being buying again",2021,06
"Only had the thing for a week and already the mic stopped working. I can't hear them, they can't hear me. I have to unplug and replug a dozen times for it to work again",2021,06
They work perfectly for my son and his online gaming needs. Good buy great seller,2021,06
I got these for my son for his gaming and decided to use them myself. Love them. I have several more ordered for myself and my other son. Great Product. The sound quality is great.,2021,06
There good for gaming but they could be louder,2021,06
First one: mic mute does not work.Returned got new one but same product: headset doesn’t work.Going to return,2021,06
"The company is so kind and understanding, really appreciated all their help with the product! 10/10!!!",2021,06
Gaming,2021,06
I love how they light up and great background sound canceling!!,2021,06
For gaming is good our pair stop working after three months.,2021,06
great value and very sturdy.  Nice color and easy to use.,2021,06
The speaker or mic did not work!,2021,06
These are pretty good headphones but for some reason others can't hear me when I speak,2021,06
False advertising. No lights turn on like it shows on the picture. I want a refund.,2021,06
"I like these, it has good sound quality. Sometimes I feel like there’s a pulsing that isn’t from the computer but my computer has had sound issues since I got it. So I’m not quick to blame the headphones. I did get them for gaming and so far have worked better than my other headphones, especially mic wise.",2021,06
Headset wire way to longUSB wire way to short,2021,06
Sound quality is good,2021,06
"the USB is only for a light, it only works via 3.5mm jack.  Misleading advertising.  Useless to me.Sound quality is fine, if a bit quiet.  Noise cancelation is below average, but exactly what you'd expect for 20 bucks.",2021,05
Mic neverworked tried trouble shooting,2021,05
Great headset and a great experience with great quality.,2021,05
"Absolutely terrible, did not work in any configuration out of the box. They sold me a piece of plastic that looks like headphones. DO NOT BUY.",2021,05
it does the job for a 12 years old zooming daily for school,2021,05
With teenagers its hard to buy expensive equipment knowing how it will be treated.  But the price of these headphones was good for the value.  My son is very happy with them and they didn't put a huge hole in budget.,2021,05
Headphones lasted one week before the sound started cutting out. You get what you pay for I guess,2021,05
The first two weeks of using this headset was great but something happened after putting it away and the quality is just poor and is cheaply made. Do not recommend.,2021,05
I would recommend to anyone if you play PS 4 or 5 this is just the best and great item,2021,05
"Good quality,  comfortable fit....great sound",2021,05
Grandson loves them.,2021,05
A gift for my Grandson and he loves them!,2021,05
Quality headphones for the price!,2021,05
My son love this hard phone we bought  it for is birthday  and he as it a month now and it's wonderful 😊,2021,05
They work great. My 12 yr old has used them for 6 months with no problem of cutting out or static but cloth ear pieces did fall off.,2021,05
Gaming,2021,05
The Headsets have a good weight to them and the light give a pretty decent lighting. One cable is for the lights (usb) and the other one is for the audio (aux),2021,05
"The product malfunctioned after the first couple of weeks, one of the connections stopped working.",2021,05
Not even two weeks cord has gone bad. They reached out to me and shipped a replacement free of charge,2021,05
Great sound quality. great product within the price range,2021,05
Amazing customer service. I had an issue with the 1st pair of head phones. I was happy with the sound quality and production value of the headphones; however the set I received was very tight against my ears causing them to hurt after only an hour our two. I posted a review of my experience and a BENGOO representative reached out to me. They sent a brand new pair at no additional expense and I am very happy with my new set. They fit properly and are very comfortable.They have great dynamic sound. I primarily use these for online gaming and am able to clearly identify if sneaking up behind me. The mic is very clear and cancels out background noise very well.I would highly recommend this product - both for the quality and the amazing customer service,2021,05
Great quality headphones love the audio output easy to setup. Highly recommend them.,2021,05
These headphones sound great and the noise cancellation is amazing but unfortunately the mic audio output full doesn’t seem to be good. When I play online on the XB1 with my friends they say my mic volume is too low after I’ve already adjusted the setting and I have not had this issue with other mics. Great headset just wish the mic was better.,2021,05
"The mic is really good,teammates can hear me perfectly,and video game noises are really good quality for the price,the noise cancellation is unbelievable",2021,05
Good headset for the price.,2021,05
My son is super happy! Now it's game time!!,2021,05
Very loud very good quality . Bought the for my husband PlayStation 5 he loves them,2021,05
"Purchased and plugged in, it worked for a bit... did a computer restart...then they never worked again. Returned them 2 hours after they were delivered then went to a brick and mortar store and purchased name brand.",2021,05
"It’s pretty good when you are in the game and need to listen to your teammates talking, but when it come to REALLY needing a good ear, its, “Noise Cancellation” feature comes a bit short. It does dampen the noises outside fairly well, but not enough for certain games that need an attentive ear.But otherwise, if you were to use this for gaming, it’s pretty darn good for multiplayer, and also really good for single player games.",2021,05
Noise cancellation is awesome!!!!,2021,05
"Headset was good while it lasted just over 60 days.  Wrapped cord for better durability clearly not resilient, and that was with a fairly mild kiddo.",2021,05
Best inexpensive headset ever! Got it for my son and he loves it. Great sound quality and good noise cancellation! The ears even light up! Best money spent for a headset so he can game in peace :),2021,05
The aux cable broke off inside the controller... I had to pick it out piece by piece. Normal use - this should have remained intact with basic gaming.,2021,05
Great headset!,2021,05
"I’ve had this headset for over a year now. It’s a good headset to use if you’re on a budget and just need basic use. The sound is pretty good, the only complaint I have is the mic sound quality. I was told by my friends that I sound muffled, but that is to be expected for a headset for this price. I still highly recommend buying this though, because it definitely is a great headset for its cheap affordable price. It’s easy to use and for me has been quite durable. Normally cheap headsets will start to degrade and tear from excessive use, but I found that this material has held up good for my uses. I have big ears and I found it to be pretty comfortable for my ears over a long period of use. Definitely recommend buying it now, as the price has dropped. When I first bought it, the price was around $25.",2021,05
Very nice affordable headset my Son has no complaints! 🙏,2021,05
"When a seller states in the first bullet that the headset is compatible with laptops and it is not, that really bothers me.  My son is happy because he has a new headset to use with his gaming console.  However, I am out of pocket and have to spend more money to look for something that is compatible with a laptop.  It is disappointing.  Do not buy for use with a laptop because it does not work like they claim even with the adapter that is included in the packaging.",2021,05
Not the greatest,2021,05
Great headset if you are starting out as a streamer or trying to save on some money. It cancels out a lot of noise. It's comfortable to wear and easy to adjust. I would recommend this. It has a nice bass and super loud. You can adjust the volume.,2021,05
You can barely hear your game. I gave up and just used my speakers on the computer monitor so I could hear enemies and what not. All these do is block noise like a pair of lighted ear muffs. They do NOT enhance game play in the least.,2021,05
I like that they fit around the ear and man they sound amazing!!!,2021,05
Love it,2021,05
"This product is marketed on Amazon as being compatible with ps4, but the USB it uses is incompatible with the console due to gimmicky aesthetic design choices that make it too large to fit past the playstations protruding faceplate.",2021,05
"I bought these for my daughter for Easter and she LOVES THEM!! we usually go through at least a 3 pairs of gaming headphones a year, but after 4 months they’re still working perfectly and the sound is great.",2021,05
Its ok,2021,05
Good gaming headphone for the price.,2021,05
Good bass and sound quality. Easy remote. Comfortable and I game for like 6 hrs at a time sometimes.,2021,05
"For the price, they’re not bad! They aren’t the best at keeping noise out or in...they just get loud, causing a little strain on the ears over an extended period of time. but overall I’ve had them over a month and I use them almost everyday.",2021,05
these are ok when i bought these i thought it would be perfect to tune out outer noise it doesnt its good to hear for music & if you play it others that are in your surroundings can hear just as much as you can.... phone calls can be heard thru these headphones... might send back but really dont like,2021,05
My grandson loved them. He uses them with his Xbox game. No issues at all. They have worked just fine. Ty,2021,05
Good sound quality,2021,05
This product is very good for Hearing and noise cancellation To me the headset is very good for gaming And listening to music would recommend these 10/10,2021,05
"Did not realize when ordering that I was ordering the same headset I currently had! It was a gift before and I really liked it and was upset that the cord had finally messed up and was no longer working correctly after some time using it. I found a great deal for this one online and ordered it. Within 2 days it was delivered already! I was very excited when I realized it was the exact headset I had been using before because I loved it! They work great, are very comfortable, have led light option, easy controls, and was a great price as well! I would definitely recommend and would absolutely purchase again in the future.",2021,05
Perfect,2021,05
Broke after two months usage.,2021,05
Incredible. It is so good! You can mute yourself while gaming without going to Settings and doing it.,2021,05
Great for about 2 day’s then broke stopped working all together. Beware of these headphones,2021,05
"My son is a gamer and also used these for school virtual and the sound was lost after about 30 days. Unfortunate because he was excited. Also, he was unable to plug in the lights because it needed a separate extension.",2021,05
"Very good for gaming, the quality of the materials is not the best but it has a very good sound quality for gaming, I also like the colors blue with black.",2021,05
"Very comfortable. Sounds is good, mic works well.",2021,05
Came Defective,2021,05
My son loves them and says they are comfortable. Would definitely recommend.,2021,05
I like a lot. The quality and the sound and really amazing. When I play online the others gamers can hear me good and clearly. I recommend this product 100%,2021,05
"One ear would go back and forth between working and not working, sometimes whole set would stop working, and this was straight out of the package. Severely disappointed",2021,05
The USB plug in is not long enough to connect to the PlayStation. The cord is so long but splits into two six inch cords. One goes into the PlayStation the other goes into the controller what the hell are you supposed to do,2021,05
Can’t beat the gaming headphones! Sound is clear.,2021,05
My son loves this headset in particular. He broke his first one and I was so happy to see it at an actual lower price than I had purchased before. He loves the led features and how clear the sound is. Will continue to buy this brand EVERYTIME he “rages” in fortnite 😂,2021,05
"The 3D audio works really well on my PS5, good quality and definitely worth the buy. Only issue is the light cable is too short and is an issue for console players.",2021,05
"Absolutely love it.  It sometimes take me few tries to have it connected to my PS4. The sound is clear, it’s so easy to use and it feels great on my head.",2021,05
"This headset is comfortable. However, the mic has static noise.",2021,05
"The product is good but if you have big ears like me i recommend bigger ear muffs, like runmus k2",2021,05
Mic stopped working and tried contacting the company and two weeks have gone by and no response. Would not recommend purchasing.,2021,05
Really good sound very comfortable and there just nice,2021,05
Sounds great,2021,05
"I bought my first pair about a year ago. I loved them and constantly used them for all kinds of things related to my computer. The first pair had perfect sound quality and I loved the threaded wire as it made it less likely to knot, tangle, and wrap up again. Getting my second pair as the first pair wore down from over a full year of daily use, I do notice they made some changes. And the changes are excellent! The headphones fit nicer on my head and cancel more noise for better sound quality. It's nice to see quality changes get better over time.These headphones are especially great for those who play videogames. Great quality, comfortable, and looks great!",2021,05
Good,2021,05
"Horrendous mic quality, constantly getting muted by teammates for it. Don’t spend the money on a wish.com quality headset",2021,05
I use these headphones for my at home job as well as gaming and I often get complaints from my customers that they cannot hear me. I actually bought these headphones to replace a different pair of gaming headphones and I do have less complaints about my audio with these headphones but even just one complaint is still pretty bad.,2021,05
The sound quality is decent but the mic doesn’t work that well so if you need a mic to play with friends I wouldn’t recommend this.,2021,05
"I've had these for about 2 years now and they still feel and sound great. Good choice for a standard, cheap headset or general PC usePros:- plastic is light and flexible. good for long play sessions.- cord is strong even after a few mishaps with my chair wheel- good sound quality. (I'm not an expert in sound mixing but i know what bad headphones sound like)- I rarely use the mic but it's functional and the mute switch still holds solidCons:- cord may be strong but it's prone to bending in weird ways. it may just be how i rapped my cord around the back of my neck but it caused part of it to form a rigid curve- the volume control is a little loose and will sometimes rise or lower if brushed against- noise cancelling is effective but not perfect; about what you expect. though depending on what you want this could be a positive- LED is barely a feature. it either takes up a usb port or the plug dangles from the back of your PC or the bottom of your controller",2021,05
Good gaming headset and a steal for the price!,2021,05
I absolutely love these headphones. The mic quality is amazing. The sound quality is also amazing!,2021,05
Great sound for Gaming,2021,05
Love these gaming headphones and they seem to be super sturdy.,2021,05
I like the sound quality and comfortable fit,2021,05
Picked these up for my son for his birthday he loves them they work great .,2021,05
"I enjoy playing on my switch more, but the headphones seem heavy, and it’s hard to plug the usb cable at the same time as the aux.",2021,05
We use them for gaming,2021,05
Great sound! Bought this to go with the oculus to get the full gaming experience. Definitely glad we purchased these. They’re also do an excellent job of blocking noise!,2021,05
Bought these for my son to use in his ps4. They would not work at all. No audio out of the headphone and the mic does not work. I tried them on my PC just to double check and still nothing.,2021,05
My hubby LOVES IT,2021,05
"Great product, great price, overall satisfied! Would buy again and recommend to others!",2021,05
The overall audio is really good but you can only hear from one side of the headphone and every often you can hear a static noise that is coming from the headset and The only way you can fix it is by unplugging and plugging back in and I know that’s not exactly you know annoying or an inconvenience but it is kind of annoying to you know having to unplug and plug back in,2021,05
"Tried to use this on a work call with my laptop and on xbox for game session. No one could hear me, the mic has very low sound pick up. Also the microphone sits differently to the picture, the picture makes it look close to the face/mouth but when pulled into position you can not get it close to the side of your face let alone level with your mouth for sound.The positive is that the lights are nice and they are comfortable on the ears.",2021,05
"Price isn’t bad for a starter especially for gamer, sound quality is great, recommend for anyone on budget, I need to get a head set for my ps4 so I purchase this one",2021,05
My son loves the headset.,2021,05
Good quality.,2021,05
"Wouldn’t spend your money on these, cheaply designed broke within a week.... volume is not that great, save your money and spend a little more to get decent pair",2021,05
This headset is by far the best one after trying a couple of devices. Great for school and gaming.,2021,05
What I like about these gaming headphones is the sound quality you can hear almost everything,2021,05
Good sound,2021,05
"I have had this headset for a month and half, it’s a very good headset! I love it so much! A big fan with how many different color choices for the headset there are too. Thank you guys so much!",2021,05
My grandson gammer.,2021,05
"Great quality, earmuffs are soft but after awhile they get uncomfortable. Would be better if it lit up without having the usb plugged somewhere so if using with a controller don’t count on it lighting up unless u can plug the usb cable somewhere",2021,05
Perfect for gaming. Great price and quality. No problems.,2021,05
This product worked fine for a few months but now they arent working. You can hear other’s good but I guess the mic is crap because the other people can’t her you talking even with the mic turned all the way up. Gave them to a child for Christmas and with in 3 months they aren’t working and he’s complained the whole time that the other kids can’t hear him. Will not make this purchase again.,2021,05
"This object is perfect, almost, the volume button is so sensitive that it accidently keeps turning everything down.",2021,05
Cord don't take beating at all,2021,05
I bought for my 9 years old  son. The size is just right for him.Nice works! He is comfortable with online classes at school. I am pleased with this purchase！,2021,05
I love how long it is has lasted and the way it feels.,2021,05
It does not light up,2021,05
"I've had this headset for a couple weeks.  So far, I'd say it is working very well.  Sound quality is good.  There is no active noise cancellation, but I don't feel that it would be necessary.  I can hear everything clearly without turning the volume up too high.  The higher you go, the more distortion you will hear as expected.  At first, I wasn't getting the microphone to work.  I unplugged the splitter from the single 3.5mm aux plug and re-connected it.  After plugging both audio cables from the splitter in again, everything worked as intended.  For those who aren't familiar, make sure the pink connector goes into the microphone port and green goes into the headset port.  This review is based on using the headset on a pc.  I have not tried using it with anything else at this time.  Also, there is a toggle switch next to the volume dial on the headset.  Make sure it is switched on (microphone symbol without line through it) if you plan to use the microphone.  Overall, I would recommend this headset.  It is priced very reasonably and it meets my needs.",2021,05
Not bad for the price.,2021,05
"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the headphones for the price that they were. They are very comfortable to wear, and the mic is placed at a good distance from your mouth so people can only hear you when you want them too. I'm not experienced enough in the gaming equipment world but the quality of sound is great for me too!  If you want a cheap, reliable headset, I would highly recommend this one!",2021,05
Great Headset! Exactly As Listed!,2021,05
"I like the design, comfortable and the LED blue is a nice touch.",2021,05
One of the sides of the headset doesnt have sound lol,2021,05
 Just opened it and connected everything and couldn't be happier with them. I was skeptical but this headset couldn't be better and the price made it 5 stars for sure.,2021,05
Only bad thing is that you don’t get to have the lights on your head set but other than that it’s the best money can buy affordable and quality thanks.,2021,05
" This is a great gaming headset for Xbox. It has very good noise cancellation. My son really liked the blue lights but just a heads up - as someother reviewers have stated, the blue light only turns on when connected to a laptop or PC because you need to insert the USB cable in.My son doesn’t seem to mind it while playing Xbox though. He loves his new gaming headset! Great customer support from Bengoo too.",2021,05
"I haven't played games in years. I was recently gifted a Google Stadia and have started to casually play games with friends online. I wanted a headset, but was not ready to spend $100. Took a chance on these and I'm VERY pleasantly surprised. I've had three hour gaming sessions with no discomfort. Sound is good. Thanks!",2021,05
No problems as of yet,2021,05
"These headphones are a great value for the price of $20! Once I put the headphones on, I was so surprised of the sound quality and noise reduction. I first listened to music on it and it was not so bad then I started playing video games and it was better than a $40 headset I got then returned on amazon.",2021,05
Awesome headset. Comfortable to wear. Noise cancellation is great I wasn’t expecting it to be as good. Above expectations for the price.,2021,05
The sound quality is very good. They fit comfortably.,2021,05
"I purchased two of these- one was refurbished and the other brand new. Surprisingly, the refurbished one works flawlessly, but the new one has many issues. You have to twist around the aux plug in and it cuts out until you twist it again. The mic cuts out as well. Some cracklings sounds. I wouldn’t purchase again only due to the unreliability.",2021,05
"They are not some high falootin' fancy headphones with surround sound...but the work, sound good with no echo and steady bass/treble, and they were cheap!",2021,05
"The headphone's sound is very good for the price & the design is interesting but not to bulky nor slim, fits on most heads & it's a good bang for the buck product.",2021,05
Great product! My son loves its.,2021,05
This does work with the Xbox series X/S. You do need to adjust the volume initially on the Xbox itself. The led lights only work when connected to usb. Overall great sound but wish the bass was a little better,2021,05
For work purposes,2021,05
Great if you're looking for a cheap headset. The sound quality and audio is poor however.,2021,05
"Amazing headphone! Large, sturdy headphone with comfortable ear padding for those all day weekend gaming session, cool neon lights/ power indicator, surprisingly crisp, killer sound clarity and volume comparable to those found on premium gaming headset all for a fraction of the cost. Will purchase many more as Xmas presents for the nephews! Thank you BENGOO for the affordable, rop-notched products!",2021,05
"I bought these headphones when my previous ones broke, and I wasn't expecting much since I payed 19 dollars. However, when they arrived I was pleasantly surprised. Their sound quality is good, they feel sturdy, and their mic works quite well. If you want well priced, good headphones, I highly recommend these headphones.",2021,05
"This product is really great! Comfy cushion for ears, comfy design on head, not a professional gamer so this is great in design and price ! Would highly recommend",2021,05
Headset is comfortable on the ears with great sound quality and great mic people can hear me with perfectly. I recommend it. Low price with great quality.,2021,05
Amazing head phones I love them but sometimes it starts to echo on my PS4 but it fixes it self if u lower the volume a little other than thst they are amazing for that price,2021,05
Looks great and sound is awesome. grandson loves them.,2021,05
For gaming the sound is good nice for sound whores. But the earmuffs are not that soft and are uncomfortable if you play for long,2021,05
"So far pretty good, my only complain would be that the microphone is too far from my mouth, it makes it hard for other people to hear me.",2021,05
Good product for the price!,2021,05
"The Bengoo G9000 is actually the best headset I’ve purchased it is so convenient for gaming, noise cancellation… I really recommend this for everyone",2021,05
I bought these headphones and they didn’t last a week. The speakers in the headphones are already shorting out and no longer working.,2021,05
"I use it for watching movies on my PC, have to say the sound is incredible, feels like I’m in a movie theartre. Great bang for your buck, 5 stars!",2021,05
Great sound quality and very comfortable,2021,05
"Has this headset for over 2 years and I have no complaints! Super comfortable so you can wear them for a long time with no irritation. Nice click for the mute feature, if you’re like me and need to check if you’re muted or not, this is the headset for you!",2021,05
Cool,2021,05
Broke after 2nd use. Buyer beware.,2021,05
This headset stopped working after a month!  Do NOT waste your money!,2021,05
"It works great, my son definitely can't hear me in the background. Lights are vibrant, my son enjoys these headphones.",2021,05
No problems and work great,2021,05
I bought these for my son and daughter and they love them. My son is 23 and a huge gamer and my daughter is 14 and constantly chatting with someone.Super happy with the item. Definitely worth the money.,2021,05
these headphones sound great. I ordered them for the wrong purpose but my husband uses them and loves them! will probably be ordering them for the other gamers in my family! DAGBUY,2021,05
Product sound quality diminished 2 months after purchase. Purchased March 2021. Sound is now inaudible.,2021,05
I definitely would buy this again.,2021,05
Works like it should. The only complaint my son has is the padding over the ears “feels a bit too small but I probably just have a big head” lol. He says the noise canceling is really good as is the sound. Would buy again.,2021,05
I gave it a four star rating only because we realized that to use it for the Xbox one you can’t have the lights on at the same time for talking because the plugs for the lights has to be plugged into the Xbox it’s self but to talk the plug has to be plugged into the controller and the cords split off of each other so it’s not long enough. Other than that it works great and my son loves it,2021,05
Works great for work! Super comfy even with my glasses!,2021,05
"This is not a good product. We all know the number of good reviews online for this item are inflated by bots. I was feeling cheap and ordered this headset as a replacement and it was even worse than expected. The fit is terrible, the materials are hilariously cheap, and the mic was broken out of the box.The joke is on me for ordering these. Be smarter than I am.",2021,05
Lights don’t turn on. On my Xbox controller and you have to scream so people can hear you,2021,05
Perfect for gaming great sound quality,2021,05
Works great with Macbook Pro. Thanks!,2021,05
"recieved in great condition and right on time, thank you",2021,05
I wanted a simple headset for gaming and this is perfect for me. My friends can hear me clearly and I can hear in game audio great. Would recommend this headset to anyone getting in to gaming!,2021,05
Not working since day one,2021,05
Great Product For The Price Quality Product!!!,2021,05
Great quality for the price!,2021,05
"I could only hear on one side of the headset, but everything else works.",2021,05
Microphone did not work fo PS4 fortnite game but worked for everything else. Lights were cool and it was comfortable but can't use it for what I need it for.,2021,05
Ordered for my grandson and it was perfect.,2021,05
I got the product and tried to use it. I plugged it into the usb slot of my ps4. The light went on and I turned the mute off and volume up. The headset does not work at all. I can hear people talking from my television but not in the headset or the headset is not being picked up by the game or working. Strongly do not recommend as it doesn’t work!,2021,05
My nephews headset was giving him issues so i ordered one of these and received  it fast and he is very happy,2021,05
Just pay 50$ for a headset this one isn’t worth it,2021,05
"The headphones were great! They had excellent sound quality,  the microphone had a few issues, the audio it pur out was alittle disappointing, but with a few small adjustments was able to work properly. 8/10 would recommend to any game looking for a affordable and good quality headset.",2021,05
They worked really well but broke after a month the wires came apart,2021,05
I stay up late to play my games and this has been a lifesaver!!! No more loud tv at night. Very clear sound and lightweight on my head. Love it!,2021,05
trash could not hear then completely stopped working,2021,05
It's good for it's price and actually came with a audio splitter which was nice.,2021,05
GREAT SET,2021,05
I really liked the lights on the headset,2021,05
This headset has excellent quality for being such a reasonable price. It has a really long cord which is nice if you get up so you don’t yank on cords. I use it to play rainbow six siege and it helps me win.,2021,05
it has amazing quality for gaming I highly suggest this item,2021,05
The headphone cord seems a little long but other then that they get the job done! Would definitely recommend.,2021,05

Great headphones for price!,2021,05
Easy to use,2021,05
Nice packaging and Quality is 💯,2021,05
This is the best $20 purchase I have ever spent!!!,2021,05
using this for gaming and music and stuff. lights work and the mic remote works. quality is ok. quality could be better. but its cheap. you know how it is. some things are good. other things are cheap. some things are both good and cheap but then they're broken. so you know how it is. life can be that way for many folks out here in america.,2021,05
It is my son's gift. My son love it very much!,2021,05
"It's a good product for a gaming headset, not too pricey, and the sound quality is good.",2021,05
I love the colors! it feels great on your head and the audio is perfect. mic is great and not too close to mouth. Love it,2021,05
"The reason why I bought this was because I wanted better sound quality when I played video games.The reason why it is good is because it has good sound quality. For example, you can hear a lot of things with the headphones like where things are. Say you can hear someone you know if they are on the right or the left.The next reason is that it has a long cord so it doesn't make you lean forward when you play a game. For example, when you use normal headphones the cord is so short that when you plug  it in you have to lean forward to make sure that you can use it. These headphones you have no problem.The last reason is that it has the ability to connect to all devices. For example, you can connect it to things like a pc ps4 xbox ect. After using them I think that I would recommend them.",2021,05
Really good Sound quality,2021,05
"My old headset was going out so I had to buy a new one. Saw this in the Amazon's choice on sale for over half off and the reviews were good so I bought it. Came in a day sooner than expected. They have great sound, came in at full volume and I had to lower the volume since it was so loud. I don't use the mic because I have a standalone mic, so I can't say how that works. My only complaint is the ear cushions aren't as comfortable as I hoped, they're kind of stiff.",2021,05
Ok,2021,05
The headset is very high quality and the price is actually cheap. So you will get an amazing headset for a few bucks. This headset is light weight and has very good quality sound for the price and is very comfortable. Microphone works good as well. Lights on the sides of the headset make it look nice.This product is very good. Very happy with the purchase.,2021,05
I wanted my daughter to have a good headset so she can talk and play and watch her shows with her cousins when they're far away. I absolutely love these!!! They look so awesome and light up and have a cord that I can move around with!??! What???? lol so far I'm loving them- can you tell?,2021,05
My son loves it. It’s the first day having it but a far so good. I’ve bought other head sets before that won’t even connect.,2021,05
Excellent quality,2021,05
"The pads are really nice, the mic rests in a comfortable spot for sound, it really is a nice headset. The ability to use a single or double plug is really nice and makes it easy to switch to different devices",2021,05
The mic could be longer but the sound Quality is awesome,2021,05
"The reason why I got it is so I could do a party chat on the PS4 since my EarPods didn't work at all with my PS4. I tried it out and the audio works brilliantly and it's easy to adjust and turn on and off the mic. Although I did want it also for the light up function that it is and it was a bit disappointing when I needed to also plug it into a USB port so the lights would turn on. I'm just glad that I have a converter for my MacBook so I could plug it to my laptop as well as my controller. Although I wish I could make it longer, the spot where the two plug ins are so I won't have to sit so close to my laptop just to get both features that I want.",2021,05
I am 12 years old and my parents let me write this review. the headphones are great for gaming and the details are amazing!  when I was listening to a song in certain spots the headphones felt like it was spinning 180 degrees!,2021,05

Nice headset with very long cable. Works great. Solid product,2021,05
Pretty solid headphones. Especially for the price! I’ve paid double for other headphones I didn’t like as much.,2021,05
"I purchased these to replace a terrible set of headphones my job provided for remote working. I am not on the phone constantly so I was not looking to spend a time of my own money for work. I have three sets of beats for private use. And while these do not compare, for the price they are excellent. They are simpler, cancel noise as much as I need, and price was perfect. They arrived in time and in good condition. I would not recommend for advanced gaming or hardcore users in need of studio quality products, but for a new gamer, young child, or someone looking to replace bad office bought equipment I would recommend little else hat would do as good of job.",2021,05
Not bad.,2021,05

Its been only two minutes since I got this and it's already much better than the last pair of headphones I owned. I highly recommend getting this!,2021,05

Quality and came with extra attachments,2021,05
Great headset for a great price I was completely satisfied with mine I bought my kid one as well I definitely recommend.,2021,05
"It's good and all loud volume and noise cancelation but it has really long cables, its probably for pc but also says ps4 so now i have a mic with long cable connected to my controller",2021,05
"I love using my headphones to play war zone . I especially love the noise cancellation!! It sound quality is amazing, the earphones are loud enough for me not to hesr any surrounding noise and it came with a 1-3 year warranty !!!",2021,05
"They worked well for a while. Lately have been causing feedback to the mic, which ofc makes them unusable. Not really sure what might have caused this issue all of a sudden. Whether it’s zoom meetings or gaming, I’m being told that when I speak there is an feedback loop. Upgrading to something better I guess....",2021,05
Love this item. Great sound and light  to wear. My kids really enjoy them.,2021,05
"This is the second set of this brand of headphones I've used, and I'm just as satisfied as I was the first time! It has everything shown in the picture and a splitter from the headphone jack to a microphione and headphone jack. The USB port gives it the lights. The audio quality is pretty good, if not a bit bass-y, but with some adjusting, it's pretty good for music. It has a good, somewhat heavy feel to it, and the foam is firm, but not uncomfortable.",2021,05
Great sound,2021,05
The product was great! I received exactly what was advertised such as noise cancellation. The quality of audio is superb and would definitely recommend to anyone looking the better their gaming experience.,2021,05

" Cool that it lights up, pretty good sound quality and it does noise cancel quite well. Time will reveal the durability of these headphones, but so far so good!",2021,05
These are really good headphones for the price. They work for my kids great. I got them each a pair and they really like them. I used them for an evening of fortnite and the sound was clear and it seemed to me everyone could understand me fine.,2021,05
"I bought these because I play games with my husband and other friends and family. I needed something better than the headset I was using. This headset is so much better. I wear glasses and it's comfortable so it doesn't hurt my ears while I wear them. The sound is good and I can finally hear/understand people when they talk. Lastly, people can hear me better. Also, the mic being on the left side is a added bonus. My husband sits on my left side while we game and doesn't always use a mic himself and it's able to pick up his ramblings so other people can hear him even without him having a mic.",2021,05
this product is good for gaming and the sound quality is perfect!,2021,05

Great,2021,05
These are the best sounding headset I've ever had,2021,05
"For the price, these are amazing and the best headphones for the price. If you’re casually gaming and or have neighbors that don’t like hearing noises, this is the headset for you. If you’re competing online and need to communicate clearly with your teammates, I do not recommend this headset for you because the audio is not crystal clear from the built-in microphone.",2021,05
For gaming,2021,05
"Perfect for gaming, noise cancellation, and great sound quality!!",2021,05
Great sound 😻 definitely recommend and for the price forget about it,2021,05
This product wasn’t terrible as it had good sound quality. But the fact of the matter is I got it last August and all of a sudden it just stopped working while in an Xbox party with my friends. I had a headset before this that stopped working but it lasted more than 3 years. This headset not even lasting 10 months is an embarrassment and I wish I bought another headset,2021,05
This is a great headset for the price.  We just bought a second one after the audio wire frayed after ~3 years of use.  My son really wanted to get the same one this time.,2021,05

I play dead by daylight a lot and I need sound to know what I’m doing. Sound is really good and sound blocking works just fine. And it makes me feel cool when the lights are on.,2021,05
It’s pretty good 😌,2021,05
"I like the quality of the microphone and the braided cord. I bought one of these about 3 years ago and had no issues, until I accidentally cut the cord.",2021,05
"I got it for my son, who is 10yrs old. He really liked LED lights and the sound was really clear. He uses it for gaming. I am buying another set for my daughter.",2021,05

Bought this for our grandchild.  It's very cool and cancels out sound very well.,2021,05
"Does exactly what I needed it to do. Good sound quality, fits snuggly. Only minor complaint is the length of the cord, but that's on me for not just hooking it up in the back. And honestly in hindsight that's more of a gripe then a complaint. Definitely not something I'd hold against the product",2021,05
These things are awesome! Paid $20.00. I don't use them for gaming so no rating but the sound quality is so good! The only problem is they don't adjust any smaller and rest a bit heavy on my head. They do have a cushion though so that helps. And my ears are completely covered.,2021,05
Incredible quality,2021,05

"This headset is perfect for ps4,  its also pretty good for xbox but i dont like how you have to plug in the extra cord and its very short. i give it a 4/5 only for the short cord. but other than that it is perfect, comfortable and overall good looking. I also like how it was packaged so neat and safely.",2021,05

"This is the 3rd pair (second through this account) I have bought and all three still work great!

A little bulky on my youngest kiddo but it works as intended and has been durable.",2021,05

Great sound quality and durable,2021,04
GREAT Gaming HeadSet for the price!,2021,04
"It has a good sound and the mic works great; Usually, others can hear every little thing in my house, but with this one it's really dialed down to just my voice.So there is active noise canceling, which takes some extra circuitry, and passive noise canceling, which is just the shape of the thing, making it really just noise isolating. Take your hands and cup them over your ears, now your hands are passive noise canceling, just like these headphones. It's a world of difference from an active noise canceling.Still a good headset, just know what you're getting.",2021,04
I love this head set so much you can hear great it has not broke at all 10/10,2021,04
Product was gift for sons birthday. Initially worked great but less then month of using microphone no longer works. Have emailed company so shall see if replacement items is offered.,2021,04
Works great,2021,04
"The wire was weak, the part near the plug broke apart after 4 months. It is still functional, but the wire is visibly damaged. You can see the metal wire inside breaking apart. The product description claims for it to have noise cancellation, but that is a lie. Every time I use the headphones, I can still hear outside noise. Do not waste your money.",2021,04

Great Audio and good noise canceling,2021,04
Got this for my son for his birthday. He loved it. It works great and looks awesome. My son said he can’t hear anything from the outside so the noise cancellation is legit. The sound quality is very clear and hasn’t had any problems. Used it for his Xbox one,2021,04
"My son used these for 2weeks and they shortages out. Very disappointing, they were gift. We tried signing up for the warranty but had to jump through hoops, I’m sure we were even approved.",2021,04

This product came as indicated. The packaging was great (no tape waste). The headphone Jack couldn't fit into mu phone with the case on but that's an easy fix. So far sound is good.  Haven't tried the mic yet. Overall good headset for the price.,2021,04
its pretty good i guess,2021,04
Great for $20! It fits my head really well and doesn't pinch at all. Sounds decent. A great find for so cheap!,2021,04

Good for the price,2021,04
"Excellent sound. It’s has tons of bass, which I was looking for.",2021,04
You get what you pay for hold true with this product....being a senior citizen on a fixed income I chose the cheapest option......Its better than nothing...so I'll continue to use it.,2021,04
Love the sleek look. Works great. Noise canceling is there but it isn't quite as good as a more high end headset however it isn't an issue in our household and the headset is excellent for the price!,2021,04
I like this product and it works really well and there are no problems at all. I definitely recommend.,2021,04
"It is very good you can hear down to 20 decibels, but the plastic piece on the side rattles.",2021,04

"A lot of head sets don't tend to fit my head, so I was happy to find this one is actually comfortable to wear.",2021,04
If u have a ps4 or 5 do not buy it it would only be good for pc you can always hear the other person and the cord is way to long,2021,04
i like it,2021,04
"Works like any headphones should, good sound, the microphone works good, lots of noise reduction, although the usb isn’t extendable or detachable, while it can be mostly ignored, it would be nice if it could be removed",2021,04
Super comfortable headset. Plugs in and ready to play. Good value for money.,2021,04
"The product is great. I love that I can use it with both my computer and Xbox. The headset fits nicely on my head. If you have bigger than average ears, this might not be the right fit for you. The headset is a single plug and USB plug. It did come with a splitter for headphones and mic if needed. It's a comfortable design and the cord is super long. It has a button on the the cord that allows you to mute the headset. It also has a volume control that gives a better control instead of having to play with the sound setting on the computer or on the TV if you are using it for console gaming. I would recommend this to all my friends.",2021,04
These headphones are very comfortable with a nice  clear sound.,2021,04
I loved how the noise cancelling worked.,2021,04
What a great product! Bought these for my son’s 9 year old birthday and he loved them!,2021,04
"Really happy with the purchase considering the money I paid. The sound has been crystal clear. Remember, this is not a 200 USD headphone, so lets not consider this with BOSE or Sony products.Also it comes with the required accessories so you can use this with the desktop.The build is really good and it holds very good.",2021,04
Love the headset!,2021,04
it sounds great! good quality! i loooove it,2021,04

Nice,2021,04
For a PS4 and it works great,2021,04
I bought these because I have a radio show and have to do my show from home.  They pick up my voice pretty well and the sound is really good.,2021,04
it works,2021,04
"Love this product! Not the best at noise canceling, but an amazing mic and headphone quality.EDIT: Still not 100% the noise-canceling, but it is good at quality. Good for a starter headset.",2021,04
Great volume and easy to use controls.  Blocks room sound.,2021,04
My daughter was thrilled to receive these for her birthday.,2021,04
Son love it.,2021,04
Just got the headset havent used it yet,2021,04
"Bought this for kids doing schoolwork from home and for gaming.  My kids love them and we bought 2 more pair.  Do not confuse these with higher end headsets, but they are certainly a fantastic value at their pricepoint.",2021,04
"Purchased for my gaming teenager, he loves it.",2021,04
This is an awesome headset for the price!!,2021,04
Hear clearly,2021,04
"Love these! Got them on a lightening deal - don’t use them for gaming, I use them for my laptop zooms and I love em!! Don’t hurt my ears and great quality sound on both ends",2021,04
Great headset,2021,04
I liked it because there is light and feels comfortable and good when you wear it and it looks cool.,2021,04
"Cancellation is good for the price. Sound is good, ear holes are a little small. But the cord constantly wraps up on itself, getting kinked and tangled.",2021,04
The colors and sounds are really great!,2021,04
"Needed a backup gaming headset. The microphone audio is a little low and the earmuffs are a little on the small side, but overall it is a decent and working headset. The head cushion on top is really comfortable.",2021,04
"This headset is Great for gaming and basically anything else! It has a volume switch so you don't have to bend over your keyboard to press the volume button, and you can change the volume as well! My favorite part is the cushion at the top, my last pair of headphones were very uncomfortable, but now my head feels a lot better because of it. And it also has a headset microphone so you can chat with friends, the only downside is that the cord is very long and it's  so it can sometimes get in the way if you're playing a game, but all in all these are great high quality headphones for a very cheap price.*This was written by my 10 year old son who plays games on PC and other platforms. He loves these heaphones!",2021,04
Very good headset for gaming and general use. I would recommend buying this headset over any other.,2021,04
"Sound quality is pretty good for the price, higher end products have a better clarity but well worth it for kids",2021,04
"These headphones are amazing, especially for the price. The cable is long and the braids make it tough. The headphones itself are pretty comfortable and the sound quality is really good. I also really like the fact that there is a switch to mute the microphone and volume controls right on the cable. Great gaming headset at an affordable price.",2021,04
They look like the photo. The set comes with appropriate cords. They work so far! Noise cancellation got only 3 stars because I can still hear people talking at a normal volume around me.,2021,04
I got the headset on a flash sale and purchased it on impulse but I am glad I did they easily replaced my current one,2021,04
"This is a good product, good price",2021,04
Cheap price cheap product,2021,04
Nice product.,2021,04
It’s good,2021,04
 This is the best mic I ordered in a while I enjoy it so much and thanks for the company for making this headset,2021,04
"Great for gaming. Good noise cancellation, awesome sound",2021,04
"🤯Wow. Not what I expected. I literally went through a lot of ""Gaming headsets"" & I can honestly say, they are legit. These headphones speak for itself. Get them!!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",2021,04
Pro:Solid build  and good looking .Sound quality.Good microphone.Worked as advertised and meet my expectations .Reasonable price .Con:Bulky for kid under 13 years old . But OK for adult .USB light needed adapter not included .But I don't use it so not a big deal.,2021,04
"The headphones fit comfortably. The headphones are not lout though. Even with everything turned up, they aren't as loud as they could be. I would recommend these for kids for that alone. Otherwise, they aren't bad as a replacement for 20 bucks. They also can use a USB or a single port (the wire is split) and even comes with a splitter for the single port (a total of 3 different ways to hook it up).  It is made of cheap plastic so it might be for everyone but it's not a bad option if you need a headset.",2021,04
"We first purchased this in December 2018 for my then 10-year-old. He absolutely loved it. After almost 2.5 years of steady, regular usage it was still holding up just fine. Then we got a puppy who decided she liked the cords better for herself than the child. :-) When I asked what kind of replacement he wanted, he said ""the exact same one I have had!"" And so, we purchased a second one!",2021,04
Very confortable headset with great sound quality.,2021,04
"Great price, solid sound and mic quality",2021,04
It’s really good and it’s cheap,2021,04

Great buy,2021,04
"This is the second purchased in the last 3 months. No; the other is working fine, that's why I bought another. My granddaughter hasn't destroyed her's!",2021,04
"It’s a great product, good quality, pretty good foe gaming and the sound quality it’s great.",2021,04
Great for the price,2021,04
"I purchased these to use with my PS4 and the sound is fine and all, but it has too many wires attached to it. You have a wire with the aux jack that connects to your controller and then you have a USB wire that you need to plug into the console if you want the headphones to light up. The lights are purely cosmetic, but it's annoying to have an extra wire attached to the controller if it's not being used.",2021,04
It works perfectly!,2021,04
"These are great economical headphones for kids.  I bought 2 sets, one for each of my kids.  They use them for remote school as well as gaming.  I have heard no complaints about them.",2021,04
Used this product for gaming. I like the noise cancellation and my friends can hear me very clearly on the mic. It looks pretty cool too.,2021,04

"The cable has a fault near the volume control. This leads to one side not working. I didn't expect much from a cheap set of headphones, but come on...",2021,04
I use it for gaming on my PS4 and I love this headset for the price!,2021,04
Audio quality is top notch. Great clear sound when gaming. I highly recommend the headset 👌,2021,04
"Its decent all around but the Mic quality is kinda bad, and the sound quality like bass wise could also use some work but overall pretty good",2021,04
Sweet good quality,2021,04
"This is the best headset I ever had.  For the price, the sound quality is fine and noise canceling works great. It also feels comfortable on the ears.",2021,04
Best quality headset for gaming,2021,04

Great product,2021,04
Great sound!  Comfortable fit!,2021,04

Great headset. Clear sound.,2021,04
"Very comfortable, good sound quality!",2021,04
It came very quick and my son loves it. Sound is clear and plenty of slack woth long cord to walk around and be very dramatic while talking to other players. Love it will be purchasing from them very soon!!!thanks,2021,04

Best earphones I've purchased so far,2021,04
My son loves the headset,2021,04
"Great quality headset, sounds great and the lights look great",2021,04
"Use for my playstation 4, it's very comfortable,sound is good",2021,04
"I needed a new headset for both my work PC and for my PS4.... This is the one! My co-workers can hear me loud and clear, and my GF doesn't throw things at me because she's sleeping and the rats have eaten me again. (And I don't hear her snoring while stealthing my way through a village.) Very comfortable fit, even on my giant noggin.",2021,04
Works great! Loud and clear!,2021,04
"I love this headset, other than the type of microphone it has, I like bendy ones, it's awesome!",2021,04
"I love the flip down mic, and sound canceling effect.",2021,04
Perfect for gaming and talking to friends in games.,2021,04
"Some might like a long cord but this is a bit long. I wish the usb port was disconnected and could be an attachment. The headphones themselves are great. The look is beautiful, The lights are a nice touch. The microphone is a bit stiff moving up and down, but that's fine.",2021,04
Good quality and nice sound,2021,04
Great for gaming I bought 2 they are pretty loud too,2021,04
"The headset is very comfy in general and it fits on my head. You're able to extend it and it's pretty good. The noise cancellation could be better, but it still works. The mic is a little too short and the mic could be better. The sound quality is very good, but I am unsure how good it is compared to other headsets. It is good nonetheless and I would recommend it. Very good for its price",2021,04
It is an amazing headphone and has the best audio,2021,04
Works fine with Xbox,2021,04
"As you can see, my son LIVES by these headphones.  He not only uses them for gaming, he also uses them for his virtual learning as well. The quality is clear and the noise cancellation is excellent!",2021,04
Great headphones!,2021,04
I like that the audio is good and not too low or too loud,2021,04
"Works great love them, only concern is it can not plug into my Xbox controller, it has to be plugged into the console but for pc gaming they are great.",2021,04
"Very comfortable and not too heavy. As most over the ear headphones, can get warm after a while. Good sound quality.",2021,04
Works great,2021,04
Very cheap quality but good for an emergency purchase. Shipping was very quick,2021,04
I use this product for Customer Service.,2021,04
"As much as I want to give more stars for this product, the fact that it is way too heavy on my head and gives me headaches is too big of an issue. If the weight of the headset doesn't bother you, then definitely this is a solid product. But I've never felt so much weight from a headset. It's kind of concerning that this is also a gaming headset because the amount of time people will use it for gaming, it can probably cause pain to your neck/back in the long run. I would suggest looking for other products, even if this product has a lot of good reviews. I don't think anyone should be having this much weight on their head, even if it doesn't bother them.",2021,04
Really good headset considering the price. I would highly recommend this to any gamer wanting a quality headset for an AMAZING PRICE.,2021,04
"I love how long the wire is as well as the ability to not use the LED light. There is also a knob on the device to lower or raise the volume. Wished the mic would go a bit closer to the mouth area, but seems to be all right for now.",2021,04
This product says it’s for gaming systems and it is not. I’m very disappointed.,2021,04
good sound good mic quality and its comfortable.,2021,04
Good sound quality. Mic needed work.,2021,04
Everything is perfect except the audio when talking on mic get a lot of complaints on quality of sound,2021,04
These headphones work great for my ps4!,2021,04
It's a decent headphone but the noise cancelation is not the best. But overall I recommend you get this headset to start with as a beginner gamer.,2021,04
Amazing for the price.,2021,04
Great product work ls like described. Xbox one never sounded so good.,2021,04
This product was an overall good purchase the quality was good and it didn't feel cheap its sturdy with a good cable. Good for the low price!,2021,04

"Product looks nice, the cord is long and they are lightweight. The led lights are nice. This is a nice entry level headset for gaming.",2021,04
Actually I was very pleased.  Especially for the price. They work great. The cord could have been a little longer like my other gaming headsets.  But I just plugged the headset into the controller and they work great. So.. for the price I think you'll be pleased.,2021,04
Awesome sound quality for the price! Was not expecting it to be this good.,2021,04
There amazing spent $100 on a pair that is half as good as this,2021,04
Other than feeling like plastic feels of quality,2021,04

Good for kids gaming experience with good price,2021,04
I bought this for my 7yo son.He uses for gaming on the PS4 or IPad and for watching videos.Durable and high quality product!,2021,04
"I'm really enjoying this headset. I am saddened by the fact that for one of the headsets, the mic doesn't work. Yes, we've tried all the troubleshooting options. But they're are working very well for me for my ps5 gaming purposes. Literally the only comment I have is more of a minor annoyance: I don't care for the distance of the split for the jack and the USB. While playing with a controller, the USB is useless but it can get in the way at times, even when I wrap it up with the velcro strap it comes with. It'd be nice if I could slide the plastic point where it splits to give myself more slack since I can't use the USB anyways. But it's really not that hard to move past. Just annoying. I'm overall very happy with my purchase.",2021,04
Solid headphones,2021,04
Its a great headset an very good for gaming i love it,2021,04
Using for work meetings and for music. Pretty good quality for the price.,2021,04

"So I have 7 kids and they all homeschool, I don't have an office but do both work and school myself at home with the kids all around me.  These seem to get everything done I was hoping for.  They are quiet enough inside to ignore the kids when needed. The mic does cancel out the computer games being played right next to me while on Skype call.  On Amazon, it did specifically say it did not come with a 3.5mm audio adapter for slitting the mic and headphone jack locations, but mine did show up with a set so the ones I ordered in addition are no longer needed.  I find them comfortable. They were an easy plug-and-play type set up. The only thing that I can't specifically comment on one way or another is longevity as I have only gotten them today.",2021,04
It works great. Great audio. Great mic. Lights are cool too.,2021,04
"This headset is purely amazing there is really no more to it, it has noise cancellation and overall amazing quality",2021,04
I like how the noise canceling was good quality and will last a long time,2021,04
This headset is super comfortable.  Use it too listen to music - great headset for the money!,2021,04

Great headset for a cheap price.,2021,04
Works so good!!,2021,04
I like the build quality and how the headphones sound. The mic quality is also good.,2021,04
" This headset is perfect for gaming, I love how cheap it is and it’s still a really nice quality, i’ve had the bengoo mic for about 2 years and it’s been working like a charm. i highly recommended you get this 5 out of 5.",2021,04
"The headset is very comfortable and the sound quality is great, especially for the cost.",2021,04
Xbox,2021,04
Much better than expected,2021,04
"This is a great headset, really cups the ears and cancels the outside sounds",2021,04
It’s a great headset.. great noise canceling,2021,04
The headset is as advertised.,2021,04
"I have used these now ever since I received them and they are very comfortable. I wear glasses so usually the earmuffs can be uncomfortable after about 20 minutes of use. Not with these, I have had no issues wearing them for hours on end.",2021,04
The cord is well made and looks sturdy,2021,04
Too tight,2021,04
Sounds nice and unit is over the ear and comfortable.,2021,04
"got these for a trip and was surprised at the build as well as the sound quality with the price of them. the build could feel a little better, the ear cups creating a better seal and the mic location or if it could move more inward. Other than that they sound great and feel comfortable.",2021,04
"Use for casual gaming, sound is good and microphone works well. I have only just started using headsets for gaming with recent events driving me to spend more time on the PS4, this is the second pair I've had and am pleased with the purchase.",2021,04
Work well and are good at noise cancelling I also like the light up effect.,2021,04
My son love it!,2021,04
I like this headset because it doesn't echo and its really good so I use it for gaming.,2021,04
I purchased this headset on Wednesday and got it by Friday really fast which was great. Now the sound is really great better than the one i currently have. Im glad i made the switch.,2021,04
"I've had these for quite some time now and they've stood up against use by myself (in my 30s), a 13 year old, and 7 year old. My only problem is that they do not work on my PS4. However they work fine for my Xbox One with no need to buy anything extra. I'm not sure exactly what I'm missing for them to not be working. Other than that, which is disappointing considering I wanted one pair for all my systems, they work nicely for the price and look good.",2021,04
"The controller on the wire is nice. Sometimes the wire gets in the way when gaming. It takes a second to get used to the headphones after you put them on. They are nice can comfortable. Not good at noise cancelling, but otherwise they are great.",2021,04
Great head phone at a good price.,2021,04
My son loves these! Especially the fact that they light up!!,2021,04
I liked it because it works and that's all I needed,2021,04
Great quality headset,2021,04
I absolutely love my blue gaming headphones. The sound is so clear and the mic works perfectly. I might have to buy the purple pair as a gift for my bestfriend. She loves purple and I love blue.,2021,04
I liked how good this product was for its price.,2021,04
Headset is super comfortable and does a good job tuning out the noise of the outside world. It works great with my Mac and android device (if the case is removed). Absolutely love the sound quality,2021,04
 great product! love the color and the sound quality is amazing! perfect for gaming!,2021,04
"My headphones had just died, so I bought this to replace them, and it works amazingly!  The sound is great quality and the noise cancelling is fantastic!!",2021,04
Works really great,2021,04
"Just make sure the USB is plugged in! Otherwise, this headset sounds great and the mic works fantastic!",2021,04
Very comfortable and the noise cancellation is amazing,2021,04
Soft and comfortable,2021,04
"I have been struggling to find a gaming headset that had both good sound quality and a working microphone, this headset ticks both boxes. I wish I bought this one first! I also really like that they provide the adapter.",2021,04
It's really nice and the sound is amazing. If you're looking for something good and not too expensive I would recommend Bengoo a lot.,2021,04
I really enjoyed these gaming headphones. They are so comfortable to fit my large head and the sound quality is awesome. The price is such a great deal also; making this an awesome pair of headphones to use when playing games or doing talks at work!,2021,04
"Great headset, came really fast and works great!",2021,04
It is a great headset for the price. The sound is great and my voice is not to messed up with the mic. lol. The only reason this is not a five star is because the ps4 settings are not playing nicely with the headset. On a PC they work great though.,2021,04
My son says they sound better than Turtle Beach that they replaced. Braided cord seems heavy duty.,2021,04
Decent headphones for kid gaming. Nothing fancy but does the job.,2021,04
Great headset at a great price!,2021,04
Gaming on the Switch. Works great.,2021,04
"We liked this headphones, the fact that they light up look amazing. The only problem is that the cable that lights it up  is very short , so you have to be close to the console in order to connect the light . It's very uncomfortable, cuz if you move it unpluggs .Other than that my son likes it very much😊",2021,04
Love the headset great sound great bass noise cancellation  all around good,2021,04
Not bad for the price. The top part hits pressure points on the head so you have to move it whwn you feel soreness. I don't twear them for longer than maybe 5 hours so it's kinda disappointing but value for what I paid is great. Not bad at all for a temporary set.,2021,04
"Works great! Looks cool, microphone works, on laptop, and gaming",2021,04
Great for the price! Sounds awesome.,2021,04
Amazing quality and comfort for the price! The microphone quality is outstanding as well!,2021,04

"when I first bought it I felt a bit skeptical about the product but when I tried it out, I was definitely amazed with how much of a difference it made in the sound quality of my games, And honestly I fell like this would be my go to product if I ever so find myself needing a new pair of headphones.",2021,04
"Overall comfortable headset, with a sensitive omni directional mic. A bit too sensitive at times. Great price point and aesthetic.",2021,04
Great item for my 12 year old's gaming.,2021,04
"I bought this after my $32 Xiberia headset broke, and was blown away by how much of a downgrade it was. I might actually tape up the Xiberia to use it instead of this. The sound quality on these is bad, there are weird whining noises in the earpiece whenever people talk to me, it has a separate USB port which I thought would be nice but its only purpose is to turn on the lights. No joke, this is a waste of $20. Spend a bit more and get a pair of Xiberias here instead. https://www.amazon.com/Jeecoo-Headset-Surround-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B07TC8J6HK/ref=sr_1_4?crid=29I5IJYBRIEL3&dchild=1&keywords=usb+headset&qid=1619124959&s=electronics&sprefix=usb+headset%2Celectronics%2C256&sr=1-4",2021,04
Fits my son perfectly. He loves the lights and loves this headset.,2021,04
" I'm pleasantly surprised. I had to hook them straight to the TV with the adapter they sent because I have an Xbox 360, but my kid is loving it and I didn't have to pay a fortune. Pretty decent for the price. Very loud. (The ""squeaking noises"" were the buttons on my Xbox controller)",2021,04
"Great audio, very comfortable headset with good mic quality for a fair price, came time as delivered, would recommend as a gaming headset",2021,04
Good,2021,04
Wouldn't work with Xbox One.  Returned for refund.,2021,04
my son loves it,2021,04
"This product is very good, It's headphone-quality is good i especially like the little switch that mutes easier to mute that way.",2021,04
Very comfortable and doesn’t irritate the ears with long gaming sessions,2021,04
Good for the price not the most comfortable and not heavy enough its very light,2021,04
good product.,2021,04
I like it,2021,04
"it works amazing. there wasn’t anything wrong. i ordered them to play the game with my little cousin and i’m not the kind to buy a headset. then i saw these and they came in before expected. they are light, got a long wire, and the sound is perfect.",2021,04
Not even a month and they no longer work,2021,04
Good sound quality and lights. Used for gaming,2021,04
Works Great,2021,04
My son got this for his birthday and he loves them!,2021,04
I dont dislike nothing of it,2021,04
Good set for noise cancellation when gaming.,2021,04
Works great.  Has lasted longer than most but still less expensive.,2021,04
Great quality.! great sound! it’s a great headset for the price. I would definitely recommend it.!,2021,04
These headphones are pretty good for gaming especially at the price. I’d recommend getting these if your not trying to break the bank. In downside in my opinion is how big the volume control is.,2021,04
Great budget headset.,2021,04
I was skeptical in the beginning but they proved out to be really good.,2021,04
Really good headset! I recommend buying,2021,04
The overall quality of the sound was really good and I can hear all my games properly through it.,2021,04
Nice headset,2021,04
quality for gaming and great noise cancellation,2021,04
The headphones have pretty good sound quality and mic quality for the price. Not very much noise cancelling but that doesn't matter much to me.,2021,04
It's a cool gadget.  Just don't like how can't have it lit whilst playing the game.,2021,04
WASTE OF MONEY,2021,04
Best headphones for your money! Work great!,2021,04
I could not get it to play the chat audio and the gameplay audio to both works at the same time but I think it was a problem with my Xbox and not the headset. The headset itself was great. The price is considered it is an amazing deal.,2021,04
Works great no issues,2021,04
I like the sound quality a lot and great bass. My only complaint is the bulkiness of the headphones. Sadly you can't change the color of the LED lights. You can only move the mic up and down and not side to side. I don't feel the noise cancellation though. Its better than I expected for a $20 headphones.,2021,04
Best headset ive ever bought,2021,04
It’s nice and good,2021,04
These are amazing and I recommend them!!!,2021,04
It's really a awesome headset my son loves it,2021,04
My kids loved the headset .,2021,04
"So far my son loves them and so does my fiancee.  Neither one ofthem can hear me when I tell at them for help bringing in the groceries, lol",2021,04
"Sound is good but could be much better, cord is too long and gets tangled easily",2021,04
Good sound quality and sturdy mic,2021,03
This product was very good and was great for gaming. It came within one day of purchase and has good sound and good mic. It has really nice pads around the ears and head to make it comfy and it looks really cool. Overall a great product.,2021,04
x,2021,04
Don't wast your money. Cheap chinese product.,2021,04
The sound quality is great and it is great for gaming,2021,04
Love how clearly you can hear.,2021,04
The kids like them for minecraft.,2021,04
"Absolute garbage. You can hearly hear people on it (even when turned up) and they can hardly hear you over the static. I've troubleshooted it and it's just awful, won't work right.",2021,04
quality of it is pretty good,2021,04
"I have purchased many gaming headphones for my sons. These are the first that not only work, but work EXTREMELY well. They were also the easiest to set up. The sound quality is great and I’m guessing that they have fabulous noise cancellation capabilities as my sons seem to not be able to hear me when they’re wearing them  😆",2021,04
Works well,2021,04
"My loved it, sound quality is good and the microphone was working perfectly",2021,04
I really like the ability to quickly turn on and off the mic.,2021,04
"Got this for my kid to play games with. Been over 6 months and it is still working great, can't beat it for the price.",2021,04
N/a,2021,04
This headset with microphone is a nice  piece of equipment for gaming.,2021,04
Sound qualityLove how i can connect the with my xbox so i can play,2021,04
"Nice headset.. didn’t realize the led lights don’t come on once plugged into controller. From my experience, it has to be plugged in to an usb outlet",2021,04
I love theme for everything,2021,04
The quality of these headphones  are top notch,2021,04
Didn’t work,2021,04
It blocks the noise,2021,04
Excellent,2021,04
She uses them every day for her Xbox and on her chromebook,2021,04
Works well.,2021,04
The headphones work great. I can hear footsteps and other things clearly,2021,04
These look really nice but the sound quality is awful... not enough volume at all!!!,2021,04
I think it’s very good and affordable I’ve owned this for a few months and have no complaints tbh,2021,04
Mic didnt last 4 months!,2021,04
The set broke after two months usage only. The sound quality became terrible suddenly and wouldn’t work for gaming,2021,04
My son loves his new headphones,2021,04
"Stiff and uncomfortable, and the sound quality is worse than a $5 pair of earphones from Wal-Mart.",2021,04
"This was an inexpensive headset and it's true you get what you paid for I guess.  After two months of my son playing with it at his desk, it just stopped working.  You could tell the materials were cheap by the feel of the headset but I expected it to last a year or so at least.I want to add I received an e-mail from this company today,  They offered me a new updated version of this headset if I would remove this review.  Some people might do just that and some of you might think it's a nice thing to do but I leave reviews for things I like a lot or have a serious problem and I want to make sure their honest reviews based on my experience so I refused the off.",2021,04
Excellent headset for the price!,2021,04
It didn't work properly and didn't fit well on my head. Too big and bulky.,2021,04
"Only worked for few months , bought for son for Christmas  already broke",2021,04
Great for gaming.,2021,04
The headset works 30% of the time. Don’t waste your time and money on this. It’s cheap for a reason.,2021,04
My son only used this gaming headset for a few months and the mic already quit working....very disappointed.,2021,04
Pretty good quality.,2021,04
"Trash. 1st set broke, impossible to get in touch with manufacturer so Amazon replaced them. 2set broke too..aux plug comes loose so audio and mic is useless. Waste of $",2021,04
This product  is absolute garbage can't even sir away seem my console and so cheaply made its not even worth the cash I spent on it,2021,04
"They are a nice fit, the only thing that could make them better if is the microphone could rotate to go both ways I like to wear the mic on my right side.",2021,04
Price and sound are wonderful on these headset and their definitely worth the cost. I have 3 of their headsets. But as i stated before quality is what you pay for. Headset will nomally last about 6 months. 5 months in the mositerproof covering of the foam heatset randommly started peeling off like paper matche. So the form headesets will gradually peel off. Its really purely cosemtic for now. But if your ocd like me then it will bother you.That beingvsaid the company is awesome on support and trues to resolve any issues. They stand by their products. So still a must buy,2021,04
"I really liked these headphones! Their noise-cancelling effect was really useful for when I had to take my laptop to school. And unlike my last headphones, the microphone didn't break after 5 days!",2021,04
They worked great!! When they connected. :(,2021,04
the microphone is literally ass. trash asf. when I went to go turn my mic on it didn’t work- and I tried multiple times. the headset didn’t work either because of the jack so.. it’s trash,2021,04
Great headphones and they hold up well for how rough my kids are with them.,2021,04
"I bought it because I had a low budget and I needed one to game, the mic quality is really good for this price and the headphone volume is good enough! The noise cancellation is spot on as well, make sure to buy because it is very good.",2021,04
"I liked it very much, it was a product I wanted and the sound quality is very good.",2021,04
Itz was very good everyting was excelente,2021,04
"I got this head set, and the mic doesn’t work, it barely comes to your mouth, the sound isn’t too loud, and the headset feels so cheap like cheap plastic... I can’t stress this enough do not get this headset worst product I have ever bought on Amazon.",2021,04
Sound is a little low but still serviceable.,2021,04
The product is very good for gaming. The ability to plug into your controller is helpful.,2021,04
My son received this for Christmas. We’ve had it for 4 months and the sound goes in a out. He’s constantly saying that it doesn’t work.,2021,04
Really got sound quality I switched my audio to the head set and really thought it was still playing on my TV. I brought one of each color for me and my nephews . I wish you didn't have to pug in the USB to get it to light but otherwise positive thoughts,2021,04
Bad quality :/,2021,04
Super headphones and very easy to use. Sound quality is amazing and very comfy to wear as well for longer times.,2021,04
Worked one time after that my daughter couldn't get them to connect again.,2021,04
Good quality and very nice color,2021,04
"I was just trying to buy a cheap mic until I could afford a really nice one. Turns out I don't need a nice mic any time soon! It has crisp audio for gaming. It works on the PlayStation 4, Xbox one and even the pc. I've had $60 mics that weren't half as good as this one. If you on a budget you can't get anything better than this!",2021,04
"With virtual learning forced upon us, we were lucky to have this amazing headset!",2021,04
Bought two pairs of these for the kids and they are holding up nice so far .,2021,04
The price is worth getting but I find it kind dumb that you need to be right by your console to connect and turn on the lights.But a good headphones to start tho!,2021,04
"This product is amazing.It was for my daughter for her Birthday, and she cant stop talking about how great that they function. Awesome for gaming. Definitely has noise cancellation because she cant hear me when I holler for her. Sound Quality is amazing as well.",2021,04
I bought this for my son and he loves it. Would definitely recommend this and plan on buying another set for my girls.,2021,04
Boyfriend loves it for his gaming!,2021,04
They are ok for the money,2021,04
This is a very nice headset for ps4. The only complaint I have is that it only lights up when the USB is plugged in which can be difficult when you already have stuff for gaming plugged in. The sound works great being plugged into controller. Overall it has worked great and my son likes it. I would not suggest buying based on lighting up unless you have an extra usb slot to plug it into USB on ps4.,2021,04
"These are great! Very heavy duty, very comfortable, the volume is wonderful, no static, I couldn't be any more happy with my purchase.  I love how they come with 3 different attachments so they will fit any device that you use. I have spent $90 on a pair and these work the same, if not better! I will recommend these to everyone I know and we will never purchase headphones through anyone else ever again. We are lifetimers!!!",2021,04
"I had ordered these to replace my headset that went out and I will admit, these worked AMAZINGLY! As a console gamer, it was a tad frustrating that the cable split isnt longer but to be honest it doesnt even bother me now. I use it for when I'm streaming on my pc and it's perfect for it! The mic quality is better than I expected and the lights look really nice. Also, you really cant beat the price!",2021,04
A good purchase and delivery,2021,04
Nice product. Recommend it for gamers.,2021,04
"Excellent for gaming, I use the to play warzone",2021,04
Had them for a while use them with PS4 awesome for the price,2021,04
I use this on my PlayStation. This is the best headset for gaming that I have ever used. Great product!,2021,04
bought it for pc gaming. the mic broke after 2 months of light usage and the audio cuts out during game.,2021,04
"The sound quality on these headphones are really good. One of my friends who uses them for gaming recommended them to me and said they've last him a long time. So far I've had no issues, the sound cancelation is also amazing compared to my last pair of headphones",2021,04
headphones are great! sound quality is good and my voice is clear,2021,04
Good,2021,04
i was looking for a pair of head phones for my gaming system and these are great,2021,04
My son uses it to play his game on ps4 he loves it,2021,04
I love this headset because it is awesome for gaming and cancels out annoying noise.,2021,04
Really comfortable around the ears and very  light headset the mic and sound works perfect and for the price it’s worth buying,2021,04
"Purchased for my son to use for talking to his friends while playing video games.  Works well and he can hear them clearly.  He does not hear us calling him for dinner, so would say the noise cancellation is good too.",2021,04
"Love this product, really fits my personality and does its job great 10/10",2021,04
Best gaming headset for an affordable price!,2021,04
"I loved this little headset for the 3 years I've used it. Long hours every day for 3 years, and the sound quality never diminished at all. In the last few weeks, the outer layer of the headset finally started peeling away, and the microphone wouldn't stay in place. I'd definitely go for just another pair of these as a replacement.Despite this, they still are fully functional, and probably will continue to.",2021,04
Pretty good so far. No complaints,2021,04
It’s pretty decent headphones for the price you pay,2021,04
Pretty good,2021,04
Great gaming headset for my 8 year old son. Great sound quality easy to install and easy to use.,2021,04
"At first I thought it wasn't going to be as good because of the price (too cheap) and honestly I'm surprised. The audio is pretty good, better than what I expected. The cancelation noise is awesome, I can't almost hear myself! You can unmute and mute, also lower and raise the volume, which I think it's awesome. Overall, better than excepted and the price is very good for what you get.",2021,04
no dislike,2021,04
So good I can play my video games,2021,04
Love the color for sure. Liking the noise cancellation and the sound quality.,2021,04
Worth for every penny! Great Sound! Decent Microphone and very comfortable!Would buy it again!,2021,04
at an excellent price,2021,04
"At first I bought these wired headphones so I could use them for my Nintendo Switch, but I use them now for anything that isn’t  my phone! They are very comfortable and give a high quality sound that makes games feel that bit more immersive. It is also very convenient to switch them between devices unlike Bluetooth earpieces. There also isn’t audio latency with compared to Bluetooth either.I definitely recommend these headphones.",2021,04
Trash,2021,04
Works great one of the best headsets so far good for gaming.,2021,04
I got these for my son. It connected to his ps4 easily and he loves them. (He is 8 btw),2021,04
Purchased this for my son. He could hear and be heard clearly. I wish the USB cord was detachable as we will not be using it with a computer. Wished there was a way for it to light up while playing video games. Great value for the money!,2021,04
Second one I’ve bought I love it,2021,04
"I used this product as a gaming headset, and is by far the best headset I have bought.",2021,04
My son loves it! Comes with extra cords too!,2021,04
Works fantastic,2021,04
Works great!,2021,04
"tested it on a simple test mic site. Tested sound. Casual user, works for me.",2021,04
The only thing that is bad is that you cannot use it on a chromebook/laptop without a gaming tower.,2021,04
Can barely hear in game audio at full volume. Not worth the money. I van get better quality from the 24.99 walmart turtle beaches. Pass on this one.,2021,04
Comfortable and works good,2021,04
"Overall, the headset works really well. It is really easy to set up and the sound is awesome. The ear muffs make it easy to put on due to their large size. My last headset would make my ears hurt. This one has an easy mute button and the cord is made out of a material that would make it last a long time. You really do not have to worry about it breaking, and in the off chance it does. The company provides great warranty for their products.",2021,04
"Sound is ok, lights are cool, mic isn't very good.  I wouldn't purchase again.",2021,04
They are comfortable and work great!,2021,04
Bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them!,2021,04
"The mic quality is more clearer than If you were to plug your plain headphones in, it's more decent sound quality. The build is pretty light due to plastic structure but what do you expect from a 25 dollar purchase.",2021,04
They are great for gaming.,2021,04
Purchased for my son for a gift... Only used for a month and they no longer work. Past the return policy.,2021,04
Product worked great and has good sound quality so far. Used mostly with PS4 and it connected easy and setup was straight forward.,2021,04
Person this was bought for love it.,2021,04
My daughter loves these for gaming with her Xbox one. She likes the idea they light up and they have never given her any issues. No she is able to connect and play with friends,2021,04
Wonderful headset. The sound is great for in game noise as well as party chat.,2021,04
I Love how this SoundsOther persons voice is so clearFor the Price it’s really goodI use this For my Nintendo Switch,2021,04
"The headset works great for my PS4, iPad Pro, and PCs. Sound quality is awesome and outside distraction noises are limited",2021,04
Great sound and comfortable,2021,04
"Pros:Games sound nice and loud without any distortion.Cheap but good.Great first time gaming head set.Comfortable even when playing for four or more hours.Cons:No noise canceling.Large and somewhat cumbersome.Cord is long and thick so if you have it plugged into a PS4 or PS5 controller it is annoyingly in the way.USB connector for the LED lights is also annoying. (Not even sure what the lights are for anyway. You can't see them when wearing the headset......unless you play in front of a mirrior).Good, cheap entry level headset. My first one, it is comfortable and lightweight but feels reasonably sturdy. Sound is nice an loud. Crisp but not a lot of bass. Would definitely recommend for the casual gamer, like myself. Microphone is omnidirectional and pretty sensitive so keep that in mind if you are playing in a noisy environment.",2021,04
The clear sound,2021,04
"I love these, its comfy and works great. Downside is I can have the volume max on Xbox live chat and hear other noises, but if I'm in a game then it fully cancels noise.",2021,04
Sound lags from time to time,2021,04
Great deal for the price and absolutely love the color!!,2021,04
The product has good sound quality and can produce a good sound. The feature of being able to mute with a switch and being able to adjust the volume is nice.,2021,04
"I haven't tried it yet but it looks good and feels snug, i can imagine doing long gaming sessions with this headset will be better than with other headsets i've had.",2021,04

Very good,2021,04
"I purchased this headset for my son for Christmas. It seemed to work fine for around 3 months, but as of now the mic no longer works (how friends can’t hear him) & he can’t hear anyone else so he can no longer even use them. Total waste of money.",2021,04
Marvelous,2021,04
"I bought this headset for my daughter to use for PC gaming. It is comfortable, good sound quality and seems durable. Friends say microphone sound quality is good as well.",2021,04
The only thing that annoyed me is that it's all plastic which means you need to be careful more. The rest is perfection.,2021,04
They aren't bad for the price but my earbuds on my phone are louder than this. Don't use them as often because of this.,2021,04
"I purchased a pair for my boyfriend and he is literally in love...he says the sound quality is REALLY good, the mic the color everything. I really feel this was a great purchase with a great price. I would highly recommend this product.",2021,04
This is the best headset and are very pleased.,2021,04
My son loved them !,2021,04
Headset was comfortable and great sound quality for and excellent price.,2021,04

"Great overall, broke too quickly but that just might be cause the kids use the heck out of it.",2021,04
Got this headset to replace a cheaper one that my son had that broke. He loves it. It is comfortable and has controls that are super easy to work. Comes with multiple adapters for different gaming controller types.,2021,04

Work well.,2021,04
Very comfortable and nice i would definitely  buy another,2021,04
The best website to get gaming equipment! I got my gaming mouse and headphones from here and never had a problem!,2021,04
The sound quality and sound direction is really great so far.  The headset is also very comfortable and almost cancels the noise completely when my mom is yelling at me.,2021,04
 Use for meetings and it works just fine!,2021,04
perfect for starting out in gaming,2021,04
Nothing,2021,04

Son loved it.,2021,04
My nephew needed a headset for his gaming needs and he absolutely loves this headset!,2021,04
The cord broke off within three months! Now I can’t return them.,2021,04
I bought this headset in December 2020 and so far it been great. This headset allows me to hear enemy footsteps in the game much clearer compared to my old headset.  I recommend this to anyone who needs an affordable headset.,2021,04
"Pretty good quality for the price I was very surprised, they’re not as good as turtle beaches but there are half the price and pretty close",2021,04
Great,2021,04

We bought these to replace my son’s headphones that the mute broke on within 6 months. He loves them and said the sound quality is great and they feel really comfortable. Very stylish and he’ll look cool to all his friends and classmates with his light up headphones.,2021,04
Nice,2021,04
Great headset for Xbox gaming,2021,04
great,2021,04
No complaints here! I will be purchasing again,2021,04
I used them for gaming and absolutely love them the sound quality is great for the price. If your wanting to something cheap that had good sound quality these are it the noise cancellation could be a little better but these are great for the price,2021,04
"This product is actually really nice for the price.  Nice sound quality and the noise cancellation is great.  Also, mine arrived with a headphone jack splitter for PC which claims isnt included.  Maybe that was a typo, who knows.  :)",2021,04
"They are great headphones for gaming, or the purpose of working from home. Can't beat the bang for the buck",2021,04
The sound quality of this product is very bad,2021,04
"My laptop has terrible sound quality and produces sound super low both from the speakers and other headphones, but these amp the sound up so that I can actually hear without straining my ears, and they also help with noise cancellation, as my roommate can get loud at night for certain reasons (if you know, you know), but if I put these on I won't hear a thing. They don't stay on too well if you move your head around a ton, normal movement is fine, but abrupt, jerky movements make them slide a bit. Still, I would definitely recommend them.",2021,04
I love this product! It’s very comfortable and stylish and versatile! Definitely would buy as a gift for someone else!😌,2021,04
Didn’t make it a month. Son was so excited to get em. Loved em for the half month they worked. Reached out to them to see if there is any warranty on them. Waiting for reply.,2021,04
Ear holes are a little small. I am over 6 feet though. Other than that it's perfect for what I need.,2021,04
We have tried to plug them into 4 different controllers and still can't get the mic to work on them. And when the mic works you can't hear anything,2021,04
Bought a or two month before Christmas. Just wrapped it and put it in the closet. My son opened them Christmas day and was excited. But when he went to use them they didn't work... And it was to far past to return them. I was very disappointed 😞,2021,04
Perfect mic quality and noise cancellation,2021,04
Best ive ever had def 100/100,2021,04
Works great with my xbox,2021,04
"Bought for use with my ps4. Works great, good sound quality",2021,04
Keep in mind other players might hear a static like noise when the headsets are plugged in. Otherwise a good product for the price.,2021,04
I was very unhappy with this product. It was way too complicated to connect to the PC. Returned the product and still having problem with the new one I received instead.,2021,04
My son is a gamer and he loves them.,2021,04
Never worked,2021,04
This is for gaming for my son and he loves it!,2021,04
Good headset. First one was defective but I was able to get a replacement right away. It’s not too loud but the headphone itself does cancel out all surrounding noise. And I have a small head and it’s very spacious,2021,04
Great quality,2021,04
Good headset for the price.,2021,04
I bought this headset because my old headset is not working so I bought it. I think this headset has a great quality for sound and I feel comfortable when I wearing it.,2021,04
The headphones stopped working correctly within a month (sound only in one ear).,2021,04
"Very comfortable and durable. Makes gaming 100X better compared to other headsets. I used to headset for gaming on games like Cod blackops, Cod Warzone, and Fornite. Helped me hear the opponents better and allowed for better gaming experience.",2021,04
That it doesn't light up on both sides of the headphones like i thought it would of then that it was great.,2021,04
Quality is ok,2021,04
Worked for my 8 year old.,2021,04
very comfy and works great,2021,04
They give very go of sound.  The color is wonderful as blue is my favorite color. Best of all is they got my head,2021,04
Perfect so far. Feels more premium than the cost. Definitely a great beginner headphone for gaming.,2021,04
"I'm not much of a gamer but I got these for work conference calls because my computer's mic is terrible. The first thing I noticed is that they felt like they were made with cheap plastic. The ear cushions are super stiff and they don't seem to get worn-in after using them. Even though I don't game too much, I still have some multi-hour sessions on GTA 5 at night and use these so I dont wake up my house. The sound is good but the ear cushions really start hurting my ears after prolonged usage. If you're looking for comfort, go elsewhere.The overall sound is good, not great. Absolutely no noise cancelling functions.",2021,04
My 10 year old loves these headphones.,2021,04
Works great,2021,04
Have nothing bad to say it does it's job and does it well,2021,04
"bought it for my 10 year old lil bro for his xbox one, he seems to like it",2021,04
Every since I brought these for my son i have to go to his bedroom about 10 times a day just to tell him he's loud... he loves them and so do I(I sneak and play his game when he's in school) I will be buying them again soon for myself and its my favorite color.....overnight shipping is a plusssss,2021,04
We used for gaming. Works great and really good price for the quality.,2021,04
"I really wanted to love this headset. It looks nice, and is very lightweight, but no matter what I did, they sound quality was incredibly poor. I wanted to be able to chat with friends online while gaming, and even with my output volume all the way up, and friends turning me all the way up in their settings, they could barely hear me. I could barely hear them, or any of the sound coming from my PC. I ended up replacing them within a week of purchase.",2021,04
I was really impressed with these headphones.  They are great a canceling out other noise and I can hear things in game that I never even noticed when I played through the tv speakers.  Great purchase!,2021,03
This was perfect for my son! The quality is great and the price was right.,2021,03
Junk!!! You get what you pay for! Left speaker and mic didn't work out of the box. Immediately returned it and got the hyperx cloud 2. It was more expensive but awesome - well worth the extra money!!!,2021,03
My little gamer liked the headsets. Easy on the pocketbook.,2021,03
"Overall very happy with the headset. The microphone never worked but the rest of the headset worked so well that the person we gifted it to used it anyway! Worked great for cancelling the noise in a small, crowded house!",2021,03
12 yr old son loves it!!!,2021,03
Ok,2021,03
Son loved them except they wouldn't work with his playstation,2021,03
Works great & looks even better !,2021,03
This thing is amazing the mic is very clear and the sound is awsome,2021,03
Basically the heading stand for itself,2021,03
Overall a great product at a great price!,2021,03
"Loving the fact that the sound quality is this amazing. Also beyond thrilled that I can wear them for hours and not have to worry about them hurting my ears when wearing them (I have size 00 gauged ears, so it is awesome). Overall VERY happy with my headphones.",2021,03
"It works, but not the quality I was looking for. Also makes my head hurt after about an hour. If you are a serious gamer, I recommend choosing a higher end headset.",2021,03
Sound quality is pretty good and the mic feels sturdy. We've used them for about 8 months now and still going strong.,2021,03
Headset was a gift for my son.  He loves that it lights up!,2021,03
I like the volume mixer so I can change the volume sound.,2021,03
The brand is much cleaner than most products of similar quality.,2021,03
Liked it,2021,03
"No issues, love the color, works great for Discord.",2021,03
It works very well i got it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it,2021,03
Not very comfortable.,2021,03
Used for gaming.,2021,03

Great product for great price.,2021,03
"My six year old grandaughter is a gamer, I've been told. All I know is that these headphones is on her head most of the time I see her, she prefers this set over two previous pair her parents bought her. So grandparents I'm still getting kisses for buying my grandbaby a pair she really liked!!!",2021,03
Very comfortable and great sound quality,2021,03
Headset does a excellent job of noise canceling and the sound quality is great.,2021,03
Good headset,2021,03
My son enjoys this headset. The quality is pretty good.,2021,03
Great Headphones.,2021,03
My son loved this headset. Thought the lights were awesome and had great sound. Perfect for gaming and virtual learning!,2021,03
"The price on this headset was unbeatable.  I have had them for 4-5 months and I can’t believe how good they sound especially for the price point.  And they have held up with nothing breaking.  They are very comfortable and I have had several 4-5 hour gaming sessions with no complaints.  They don’t sound as good as the Sony Bluetooth set I have but they were 5x more expensive so I didn’t expect them to.  The LED lights are cool but fortunately you can not use them by not plugging in the USB connection.  If you are looking for a comfortable decent sounding wired headset for a great price, look no further!!",2021,03
Awesome product. Great price and sound.,2021,03
You have to scream into the mic and the volume is low.,2021,03
Does not work!,2021,03
"Kids love this. Its loud, you can hear clearly, has a long cord and the lighting is a bonus",2021,03
love the colors,2021,03
ear pads are VERY small must be made for little kids ears mic is short but overall sound is good. Wish it had a clip for the controls.,2021,03
"the inline controls are handy and the bass is quite boomy, also very comfortable for longer game sessions",2021,03
"My son loves his video games and with this headset he can play with his friends. This is the second one he got and he wanted the same one because it is so comfortable. It is really comfortable on the ears, the voices are clear, and he loves it. We would highly recommend it.",2021,03
i love the headset and it works great,2021,03
These are great headphones! My 12 year old son loves them! The noise canceling is very impressive on them for the price!,2021,03
"Perfect for my 8 year old. The size adjusts to fit his head, and expands for anyone else in the family. He especially lights the color and lights. I can’t speak for sound quality since so haven’t used it myself, but he’s happy.",2021,03
This does not work for an Xbox one!  False advertising!!!,2021,03
My son loves them!,2021,03
"Comfortable, good sound, overall and excellent product for the price.",2021,03
Very nice and good quality headset. The gaming experience and noise canceling and sound quality are amazing,2021,03
The is ver good k live it,2021,03
This headset was purchased as a Christmas present for my son.  He really loves it.  His friends ask him what headset he has because they can hear him perfectly.  Must have good sound quality because he can never hear me when I try to talk to him.  Great product for the price.  Glad we went with this one.,2021,03
My daughter loved the color,2021,03
This headset is light weight and has very good quality sound for the price and is very comfortable. Microphone works good as well. Lights on the sides of the headset make it look nice.,2021,03
Works perfect for my gaming device.,2021,03
Could be louder when connected through the XBox Controller,2021,03
Ther is nothing bad to say about these Headphones,2021,03
Works good. Mic stopped working but the seller was very quick in sending a replacement copy. Good,2021,03
"Bought these for my son for when he's playing games on the PC. They are comfortable, have great sound, and simple to set up (On a Windows 10 PC). Great value and a great product.",2021,03
"Not even 2 months and they broke, can't even get ahold of manufacturer.",2021,03
The boys love these headsets,2021,03
The lights. Also like the noise blockage.,2021,03
"I like the sound quality, my kids love it, perfect for playing video games! 100% recommended",2021,03
Love the headset works great and does the job would definitely recommend to buy for all gaming and headset needs,2021,03
Some people will hate and say these are bad headphones cuz they’re cheap. I’ve been using these forever. Their sound quality is great and the mic quality is just as good as any other mix. No need to spend hundreds on a mic and headphones when you can get it for cheap.,2021,03
" This is exactly what I wanted. Cancels all noise in the background, lights up, and its my two favorite colors. Thanks Amazon. I’m in love.",2021,03
Nice,2021,03
"good for gaming, comfortable",2021,03
Very good quality and very comfortable headphones,2021,03
"It's also super comfortable. I play for hours a day, and I dont ever take it off because I forget I have it on. 10/10 🌟🌟🌟",2021,03
I liked everything about these until the microphone stopped working after only about a month or so.,2021,03
Had to buy the Adapter separately,2021,03
I used these headphones for gaming and they were by far the best headphones especially considering it’s price. The earmuffs fit nicely on my ears and are very comfortable. What would make these headphones even better would be the ability to change how high/low you want the sound of the game versus the sound of voice chat and vice versa like PS4 headphones.,2021,03
"I have never had a headset with a worse mic, audio quality is complete guarbage. Headset sound is bad too",2021,03
Very good works perfectly good as 100 dollars one saves you money and gets job done noise cancellation awesome,2021,03
Gaming pc,2021,03
The microphone broke within a few hours of play.,2021,03
"I am very pleased with the quality on the device, it does not feel cheap in any way, for the price is a lot better working that other more expensive ones, is not too heavy which make it very comfortable to wear for hours in online tournaments, the cushions seat perfectly around the ears isolating from external noise and making very clear the sound on the games.Even when these are considered entry level, It is a pleasure to use them while playing all my games.I also use them to play music and the surround sound is amazing, i can hear every instrument with absolute clarity.I guess i will be updating this review as the time goes by, but for now, i will say that i am very pleased with all the characteristics and for the price, you cant go wrong.Frank",2021,03
I got this headset for my 10 year old son. It’s has great surround sound quality. The over ears design work well. My work from home office shares the same space as my son games in. This  allows him to game after school quietly and headset cancels the sound of my work conversations. They are conform able and work great.The,2021,03
Awesome got a pair of these for my brothers birthday and he really liked them,2021,03
My 8 year old son likes these headphones. They work great and look nice! They are also very comfortable. The lights are a nice touch. We would purchase them again!,2021,03
"After 1 year of using these headphones I am finally going to get rid of these. That's not to say it's bad it's just not for me. After a year, these still work great (even though they've fallen too many times to count). The audio is fine, but everything else is lacking. Straight out of the box the microphone levels were too low so I had to already go to my sound panel and microphone boost it to +10 dB. I could hear my voice nice and clear but it picked up just about everything else in my room, not to mention that it also picked up the sounds from the speakers inside the earcups. Made it impossible for me to play in a voice chat with friends because you would hear double the audio. Now onto the build quality of the headset, you get what you pay for. I am a pretty small person (kinda sad) and this headphone was still too small for me. It hurt my ears and the sides of my heads.For 30 dollars it's a decent set of headphones, but I recommend you buy something better, 3/5.",2021,03
I got this for my son for his birthday and we are very pleased with the quality and this price point you can't beat it.  Great product!,2021,03
"I like the headphones, but they just don't have the volume I expected.",2021,03
It is a $25 headset for small kids. If it breaks it’s a $25 headset for kids.,2021,03
"only complaint is that when at high volume, a buzzing can be heard",2021,03
This is a very comfortable headset with good sound quality.,2021,03
My son loves these.  We had purchased another pair and he said they were very uncomfortable.  He requested these and is very happy,2021,03
"I got this to better hear players in PS4 titles such as Vigor, Apex, and DayZ. It functions far better than my old headphones. The sound of my neighborhood is less distracting with the noise cancelation, and the headphones fit me much better and more comfortably.",2021,03
"I use the headphones for gaming and they seem perfectly fine; no issues. Sound is clear , headphones are comfortable, and mic works as advertised. Nicely done.",2021,03
My son loves them!,2021,03
I am using this headset for gaming. When I got them took alittle bit to figure out that you have to have the boom mic all the way down to use it. When it is up it is muted. Other than that I am really enjoying them and worth the money.,2021,03
My son is really happy with this.they are really good.,2021,03
"I use this product for online gaming, extremely happy I bought the headset, now I can communicate and hear other players.",2021,03
"Everything was good except the mic. I can't talk for some reason I've tried everything, the mic needs to be tweaked.",2021,03
It was not eyeglasses friendly and caused a headache after an hour.,2021,03
This is the best headset I’ve ever used! And for a affordable price it’s not bad at all!!!,2021,03

"It arrived in time, the overall quality of this products is good.",2021,03
Great video game headset. Love how it has the adjustable speak in microphone. Now players can actually hear me.,2021,03
"This is a great headset. Sound quality is great both on the headset and on the other end of the microphone. Comfortable padding on the band across the top of my head, and on the ear cuffs as well. Great purchase.",2021,03
"I got this for my lil’bro as a gift. He really loves it. Very Essen to many of his needs like gaming, playing on his phone, etc. I’d buy one myself if I had enough money, lol. Good buy for kids.",2021,03
"They work as intended, but sometimes they're weird. You do get what you pay for. The cord is obnoxiously long. The microphone only works if I have the switch perfectly in between the muted and not muted setting. Very odd. The headset covers your whole ear so it doesn't put pressure on them, which is nice. The headset itself is pretty big and clunky though. Definitely a good purchase if you're a casual gamer who just needs a cheap headset. Had it for a couple years and it works.",2021,03
"Purchased for my friend to use with her Zoom classes - works great with iPad, Chromebook, and computer so far.  Love it",2021,03
"I only bought this because I needed a headset Asap, due to mine missing a wire, and when I seen this headset as I searched for one I wanted to try it out. Since I’ve tried it out, it has been a great find, and is worth the money that I spent on this product.",2021,03
"Low end performance, not as comfortable as I expected.",2021,03
"Amazing headphones. Not too bulky, sounds great and my son loves it!",2021,03

I really like the color,2021,03

I like the way it produces quality sound and enjoyable.,2021,03
The sound quality is very clear and perfect for gaming on the ps4. Mic is clear. Very happy with these.,2021,03
"(Original review: For this price, they're pretty good. They aren't 100% noise-cancelling, but around 90%. The speakers in the headphones are great. The microphone isn't great though. I was told I sounded like I was speaking into a plastic cup.)Within the first two weeks, the headphones no longer light up and the mic doesn't work. Customer service never returns any emails, even though I've sent 3 to them. Very disappointed! Will never buy from these people again.",2021,03
Good,2021,03
Very nice,2021,03
Nice and clear,2021,03
I can hear every footstep on any game I play great product.,2021,03
Product is real great.  I have big ears and it fits over my ears real well.  Volume adjustment wheel move easily. Would recommend.,2021,03
No dislikes,2021,03
Son loves it.  Great product for the price!!,2021,03
Good for ps4 and my pc sound quality is great and product is very well put together.,2021,03
Good quaility for price,2021,03
I purchased these for my son. He really loves them. Best headphones I have purchased.,2021,03
Could not be happier.. cord a little long but certainly not a deal breaker sound quality and comfort A1,2021,03
"For any headset as inexpensive as this headset, its actually a good one. It didn't have the best quality like what I normally get..but I didn't expect it to be very good. It felt as if it was kind of crushing my head from the cheap foam earpiece, and the foam piece that rests on top of your head didn't make it that much better. I could only wear it for about 30 minutes to an hour before hearing the pumping of my heart. The audio wasn't the best but it definitely isn't the worst audio. The mic is great and my friends said the only difference between my $200 mic and this one was, it was quieter. The adjustable function for the headset is what I disliked the most. Each time I adjust it. It always made a loud cracking sound from the adjusters, and each time I felt as if I was going to break or snap it in half because of how hard you have to pull to adjust the thing. In all, I wouldn't generally recommend this headset. I know it's a cheap option, but I have found lucid sound headsets or other main brand headsets as cheap as this one, that have a lot better quality than this one. I'm giving this one 4 stars mainly because its a cheap option for gaming, but I could easily give this 2 since I can find better options that are as cheap as this headset. If you are looking for a good headset that will last a long time. I recommend corsair voids, or just any ""more expensive headsets"" aiming around $75-$150",2021,03
This headphone fits my head so comfortably and allows me to be fully submerged in the sound. The mic works great and I have not found any trouble so far.,2021,03
"The sound quality is amazing, you only hear the gameplay, and IT CAN LIGHT UP!!",2021,03
This is the best headphones on the market,2021,03
"havent really had time to really try them out, but have worked great so far on one game",2021,03
"I used this headset for my ps4, Works great for chat, very clear to listen to, cancels out background noise.",2021,03
I’m not for sure the headset is good but I’m gonna take a guess and say it is. I never got to use it because mine got destroyed.,2021,03
:),2021,03
Excelente,2021,03
I love that it lights up but I have a ps4 so to have it light up and plugged into my controller... I kind have to choose which i want to use. 😅 over all it’s a nice looking headset!,2021,03
Was perfect for my gaming needs,2021,03
My son enjoyed the sound quality of the headset and loved that it turned on the colors!,2021,03
this product is a little small for people with big heads but I enjoy the sound quality and the base. to me I have tested it and it has quality sound.,2021,03
"This headset is beautiful, slick and comfortable. It does its job with beautiful sound and quality gaming.",2021,03
"Not gonna lie when I first got this headset I really was not expecting much for the price but I was looking for a headset upgrade (my current ""gaming"" headset was some skullcandy headphones). I just wanted a headset so that I can have awesome sound and mute myself when I wanted to. These are honestly great. I haven't had the chance to use them for gaming yet (college student life) but Jesus they are amazing for rocking out so far and the light up feature makes them look awesome! Motley crue has literally never rocked harder lmao. Seriously for the price, these are a steal! Hoping they last a while.",2021,03
"Just got these and so far, they have lived up to the hype. Phenomenal value, no complaints on these at all.",2021,03
Very comfortable to wear while playing games!,2021,03
This is my second headset from Bengoo- I love this!! Sound is amazing and it looks super cool,2021,03
"Fits well and comfortable for my 8 year old - great price, too.  The plastic seems a little cheap, but looks like it will hold up well enough to my rough 8 year old boy ;).",2021,03
Sound quality is amazing and definitely is good for talking trash on Online games haha,2021,03
My son is happy with the quality of his gaming headset so far. Thank you!!,2021,03
It came in good condition and it has good sound,2021,03
Dont work with ps4 to good and not for kkds the mic will break off if you drop it or hit it when its out no flexibility,2021,03
It is OK for a beginner headset or for your kid who plays and he’s probably gonna break it after a couple weeks but other than that you pretty much get what you pay for it’s made out of cheap material and feels like it anyone who plays a lot It’s probably not what your looking for.,2021,03
I love the sound quality as i am using it for school. i also enjoyed how well the microphone worked too. love the lights and I feel like I am in the zone whenever I use it!,2021,03
"The quality seems a little cheap because it’s plactic but the quality, and all the features are on point. They are really comfortable and make it fun to play with",2021,03
Works exactly how I needed it to.,2021,03
I bought this to use as a cheap racing headset to communicate with my drivers and surprisingly it works fantastic so far. Sound quality and noise canceling seems really good. The real test will be in a couple weeks at my first race.,2021,03
Update:The mic no longer works after 6 months and there is no product support.,2021,03
Great headset for the money,2021,03
Well.. I had to prep them to handle a floating ground output amplifier.. THESE HEADFONES ARE ALMOST KNOCKING MY EARDRUMS OUT OF MY NOSE WITH PRECISE AND POWERFUL SOUND DELIVERY 💯💯💯💯,2021,03
Amazing headphones for gaming!Great product.I recommend them.,2021,03
They’re good pair but are very flimsy after a few uses but don’t count on my review my sister I think may have messed with it,2021,03
This headset is good if you want them for gaming 10/10.,2021,03
Awesome was surprised how easy sound really good very comfortable. Was surprised how comfortable plush and soft i have never used a gaming head set I hate them there uncomfortable. I usually buy high end but went cheap I thought they would be crap honestly they sound as good as my bose !!! Wow,2021,03
It works great! I used it for my school and it works really well.,2021,03
it was great especially for the price,2021,03
"Looking at the amazing price and the sheer number of reviews, i thought these would be good, but I was disappointed. They look really really cheap, and feel that way too. Mine had some dried glue or subtance from the factory on them. They were ok in comfort, but I had to draw the line with sound quality. If you've ever owned a pair of Turtle Beach headphones, these sound so muffled. There was no range to the sound at all. Just mids and lows. It made it hard to be competitive in warzone because you couldn't really make out some crucial distinct sounds like the direction of footsteps or gunfire. I probably should have known better, given the price. According to other reviews, this headset is pretty decent, but i guess they just aren't for me.",2021,03
Bought for our son since he likes to talk while he plays and takes ours constantly. Loves them and have great sound.,2021,03
I have used this headset for a few days now and have no issues. The old set that I used from a different company had interference with my friends playing and could hear themselves talk to me. There is no issues with that from this new headset that I purchased.,2021,03
Feels and sounds great! The audio is amazing and the lights are so nice,2021,03
For gaming!!!!!!,2021,03
comfortable fit,2021,03
Cool colors. Lights up.,2021,03
great sound quality,2021,03
Nice quality for a good price!,2021,03
This was a good product in all my other headset brpke so i got G9000. I was shoked that it had prety good of everything.,2021,03
It’s a very good gaming headset that has very good noise canceling and allows u to focus,2021,03
The quality and i dont like the usb cord,2021,03
Fast shipping. Great  buy for the price. Definitely would buy again,2021,03
"I bought 2 pairs of these as gifts and both pairs were a major pain in the A to connect to pc for gaming. Sound quality is very decent for price, but would not reorder due to connectivity issue...I do not even know how I finally got it to work. My pc settings are whack now, but they have a headset to use...mic is not the greatest. Must speak loudly to hear and does NOT shut off even when button is switched off...",2021,03
Great product,2021,03
works well and looks great,2021,03
"Excellent for gaming, incredible noise cancellation, and great sound quality. Feels like I'm actually in the game.",2021,03
Good good good !,2021,03
its awesome im able to talk better and hear better,2021,03
The headphones echo when your gaming and noise cancellation sucks,2021,03
Quit working within 4 months of use,2021,03
"They looked cool and the comfort was not bad - But no matter how much I adjusted settings and played with them, people had a hard time hearing me over mic. Got annoyed and gave them away as I did not want to go through the hassle of returning them.",2021,03
Look good,2021,03
My son (8) enjoyed the design.,2021,03
I have bought close to 25 sets of headphones for doing my gaming channel on youtube and these are by far the absolute best FINALLY,2021,03
I love how the sound response on this headset!,2021,03
Works great with when playing roblox!,2021,03
"I got these headphones to upgrade my cheap starter pair, and I have been using them to teach English online since January. They have performed wonderfully: I can hear my students' pronunciation very clearly, my students have no trouble hearing or understanding me, and I am not dealing with a headache after wearing them for five hours straight. Plus, my Chinese students think they look cool! They've been a great investment, and I highly recommend them for other online ESL teachers!",2021,03
My son is happy and uses for distance schooling and gaming. He breaks headphones all the time so hope they hold up,2021,03
Great headset for the money. Very pleased.,2021,03
For gaming,2021,03
Microphone is super faint and far away people can barely hear u at all,2021,03
I'm not gonna lie this headset was better than I anticipated. I'm super happy I bought this one. Looks great and sounds awesome. They are sooo comfy to wear its amazing. Great gaming headset for a really good price.,2021,03
The sound quality was good but it barely picked up my voice and always had a constant ringing noise whenever I plugged it in,2021,03
"My son was very happy. It's bright blue, has a blue light, and looks like it came from outer space.",2021,03
Great item,2021,03
"These are super lightweight headphones with good audio and microphone input. The wire is very long and durable as well. Controls on the wire work. Plugs are covered with a plastic cover for protection, and it comes with the adapter for PC use. I love the pink color, very nice and pastel. The lights add a nice flare to it as well, although they only stay one color and don't change. Padding is comfortable and does not make the headphones feel so heavy and tight on my head. The material is like a hard plastic for the overall headphone and controls. I like it a lot. I recommend getting these headphones.",2021,03
"Product defective, arrived broken. Microphone does not work. Volume one output randomly changes. Would not recommend.",2021,03
"Excellent headphones for the price. Great noise cancellation, i couldn't even hear my dog chewing up a new pair of shoes right next to me while i had them on.",2021,03
Great product with reasonable price.  I bought a second one.,2021,03
they work super well w my ps4!!! best headset i’ve gotten so far,2021,03
"So far it works well for what I do, which is just playing online with my friends. But the mic works well and the sound quality is very good. It's the first headset I've ever bought but I'm satisfied with the purchase.",2021,03
"Comfortable, good sound quality. Went with the purple color and i love the way it looks. Happy with my purchase",2021,03
"I wasn't expecting much heading into my time with Bengoo's G9000 gaming headset. After all, it costs around $25 and is made by a relatively unproven brand. Surely it can't beat the likes of Astro, SteelSeries, Turtle Beach and the like, right?Nope, it can't. But what you do get is a surprisingly solid pair of cans for your gaming needs. The Bengoo G9000 is an over-ear headset featuring inline volume control, a flip boom microphone, and non-customizable blue LED lights. It looks the part it plays for those who like something a bit flashy looking, though I personally was never a fan of the sharp, pointy edges that mainstream gaming accessories tend to sport.",2021,03
I like that they aren't to loud and very clear. Very comfortable.,2021,03
Solid headset. Not bad for videos and music but it excels for video games with much needed audio awareness.,2021,03
Son used for gaming. They worked.,2021,03
This product is awesome I love how the sound quality is perfect and the only thing is that after about 2 hours it starts hurting your ears but barley. But overall I LOVE this product. So I would totally recommend buying this and I've looked at many headphones and this was the best one yet.,2021,03
"Good sound, if I keep it on too long, it hurts my ears. Might be too small for my giant ears",2021,03
Got them for my boyfriend and he loves them.,2021,03
"Good sturdy quality, great for gaming. I just got mine in today. So far they are worth the money I spent. Noise cancellation isn't bad. I like LOUD, these are a bit quiet for me. But others in the house thought they were plenty loud.",2021,03
I love the fit of the headphones and the extra padding.  The sound controls on the cord are easier to use than other headphones.  Gamers that I am playing with said that my sound isn't as clear as my previous headphones.,2021,03
I liked the mic,2021,03
Pretty good for the price.,2021,03
For gaming it is really good.And the noise is perfect I can hear it very well.,2021,03
"I bought this headset for my boyfriend’s birthday last month and he loves it! For the price this is an outstanding product, it’s high-end quality in my opinion and hasn’t given any issues at all.",2021,03
First ever gaming headset and it’s awesome. Fits comfortably and is great for talking and listening.,2021,03
Reliable,2021,03
"I needed a new set of headphones for working at home. I hate those little ones that is often recommended. I like my ears covered all the way. These are perfect. They fit over my ears just right and the mic works beautifully. Bonus, they light up in my fave color. Love that the cord is rope. Working on getting a matching keyboard and mouse but that's another story. Glad I bought them. Happy.",2021,03
I bought this for my son and so far he really likes it. Overall design looks nice; however he said he can still hear the background noises.,2021,03
I like this headset. I really do! After about an hour of wearing the headset it starts to hurt my ears a little bit. Not that the volume is too loud but maybe because I have a big head and big ears. For the price the quality is great! The seller did everything as promised and shipping was on point.,2021,03
It works really good for this cheap of a headset I was really suprised I just got a razor headset not to long ago but this one works even better I think,2021,03
Great price headset for what it is.,2021,03
You could hear everything that is going on in game and the noise cancellation is amazing!,2021,03
Good headset for gaming.,2021,03
love the noise cancellation and very comfortable,2021,03
Hi.  I'm 11 and I use this for gaming and distance learning.  It's great.  I can really get into my games when I'm gaming because the sound quality is great and I really enjoy feeling like I'm in the game.  It isn't quite noise canceling because i can still hear a bit when I have the headphones on my head.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase.,2021,03
Tup,2021,03
"Very comfortable, great sound quality",2021,03
"Headphones came in a bag not in a box, no instructions and no warranty info.",2021,03
"Excellent product I use it for my PS4 and Switch. No issues at all, I highly recommend!",2021,03
Not made for ps4 you can only use it as a microphone or headset at a time so you got to go to settings and choose which setting you want,2021,03
Do not waist your money on this!the mic does not work. my son was excited about this headset but now i have to find him another that actually works.,2021,03
Didn't realize until the unboxing that in order for the lights to work u need a usb not a super big issue it was a gift for my son's birthday he likes them very much,2021,03
"I bought these for my daughter and she absolutely loves them. They are a nice size, not too bulky and the quality is good for the price.",2021,03
Ordered for my daughter for her Xbox to play and she loves it great buy !,2021,03
Best pair of gaming headphones my boyfriend has ever had!,2021,03
Great for gaming,2021,03
Great,2021,03
Really love the noise cancellation and the padding at the top definitely gonna purchase,2021,03
"Honestly, it is really good!",2021,03
very nice,2021,03
I disliked it because people on pc can hear their self like a robot but anything else it’s good,2021,03
Great set of Gaming Headphones .My husband and my kids both agree this was a good purchase .I like the design and it's perfect for adults and children .Sits comfortable on the head and gives good sound and others can hear you as well when playing online .Very happy with this product .,2021,03
This product is very good for noise cancellation and is long lasting very recommended,2021,03
"It was clear to hear but speaking for me, no one could hear me enough.",2021,03
its very comfy to wear and its colors are really cool,2021,03
I’ve have bought this item two times it has lasted me since 2018 and has been great this is probably the best budget gaming headset👍🏻,2021,03
USB plug is not recognizable by computers,2021,03
"My old gaming headphones broke and I quickly searched Amazon for a cheap pair for a few bucks. I found these and saw they had great reviews so I decided to give them a shot. I didn't have any expectations, but these headphones blew them out of the water. Amazing sound quality and EXCELLENT noise cancellation features. Highly recommend these headphones.",2021,03
"Good fit, good sound. Purchased on sale, worth it.",2021,03
Sound is great. I love the LED lights. Matches perfect with my game room! Thanks!,2021,03
Ive been using these headphones for over 2 years and they are great for only around 25 dollars.,2021,03
Bought this for my son and he says it’s awesome! Mic works great and the sound is amazing. Great product for a great price!,2021,03
It’s a great headset overall. My son loves it.,2021,03
Great headset for my son. So far so good,2021,03
Awesome headset for the price!,2021,03
Very nice headset especially for the price!,2021,03
Needed a quality headset for a good price. Works great.,2021,03
these are amazing!! i love how they look and how well they work for what i need. great sound quality and nice mic.,2021,03
My sons love these gaming headphones! The sound quality is great and they look really cool too.,2021,03
Cord is too long but still good,2021,03
"Great sound, the noise cancellation works well!",2021,03
"Excellent headset for the price. Easy to use with Windows. Plug and play.  Sits over the ear so the noise cancelling is passive. You can still somewhat hear things going on around you, but its not disturbing",2021,03
Fantastic,2021,03
"I recently purchased this and I am amazed at the high quality of it. The sound is great, the cable is long, and the lights on it are amazing. I showed it to a couple of my friends and now they are making purchasing one. I highly recommend it.",2021,03
"great headset, definitely would recommend for any gamer.",2021,03
"Comfortable and lightweight.  Sound quality is pretty nice and bass is deep.  Volume also not a problem, definitely as loud as you need.",2021,03
"GREAT  PRODUCT,  HIGHLY RECOMMEND",2021,03
I purchased three of these gaming headset sets for my kids and the two had the same issue. The sound connection is not really the best quality. They start off great then after a few days of playing the sound becomes a problem.,2021,03
Great Quality for the price. Noise cancelling is great and sound quality is awesome. Recommended!,2021,03
itr is a very good headset mic is good sound quality is good and is very comfortable,2021,03
This is still 5 stars because description is correct and perfect for price nothing else will beat it!! best for laptop pc gaming but I bought it for ps4 console. So the lighting feature won’t work because the usb cable is not long enough to reach the console while also having the auxiliary plugged into your ps4 remote. What you can do is have a phone charging battery pack with you to have it power up the led lights lol. That’s what I did,2021,03
"What a great headset! They work just as intended and they’re stylish. No complaints, delivered on time with no hassle. 10/10 would buy again. Amazon is a great company!",2021,03
Very good!,2021,03
So far so good!  My son is super excited to have an official gaming headset.,2021,03
I liked that the sound quality was great for the price. It’s comfortable although haven’t worn for more than an hour but I’m sure it will still be comfortable. Only drawback is the version I got had the usb and six cable too short to separate. I can only plug in one or the other. Usb is used to light up and six is for the sound. So either I get lights or sound but not together unless I hookup to a power bank.,2021,03
"These sound so good and they are at a great price, highly recommend",2021,03
Great sound. Comfortable adjustable fit. My son uses this for online school as well as gaming fun. Would recommend this product to others.,2021,03
Purchased this for my son and it has been great to take some noise down and gives him a better sound.,2021,03
"My 7 year old son loves these headset, they are made of good quality plastic and work very well.",2021,03
Product worked as mentioned. A little uncomfortable over the ears after a couple of hours for those who wear glasses. Good bang for your buck.,2021,03
"I like it, it's very comfy and the ease of access is wonderful, the sound is wonderful!",2021,03
"For the price the quality is really good, they don’t hurt my ears or my head. Super easy to control the volume, and the lights on the side are pretty sweet. I’d highly recommend these.",2021,03
 Great price good quality. Wireless would be nice. With a better performance microphone.,2021,03
"Purchased this headset for my son and he loves it. The sound is very good and it also cancels the noise pretty well. Works well with our PS4. Also worth mentioning,  it is very soft and comfortable. Would definitely recommend.",2021,03
My 10 year old loves these! He looks and feels like a super gamer now!! :),2021,03
"realy good headset, but not the best noise cancelling. Still its a good headset",2021,03
I’ve had it for about a day now and it’s already been a big use in my life. I’ve so far used them to play games with my close friends and it’s great we can here each other clearly. It’s also good for recording audio for things like animations and twitch streams. These a a great pair of headphones and I recommend them.,2021,03
Love these headphones. They are perfect for gaming and the sound quality is awesome!,2021,03
They look cool at first glance.  But one plugged in the sound quality was alright on the left side. Barely audible on the right side. The mic seems to be decent though I will say that.,2021,03
This has great mic and noise cancellation,2021,03
Great gaming headset for my son!,2021,03
Junk! My son barely used these for a month... maybe a total of 24 hours and the sound stopped working. The sound stopped working on one side and then 2 days later both sides gave out all together. Don’t waste your money.,2021,03
For Gaming,2021,03
We are very pleased with these headphones. The quality and price are great!,2021,03
"Very nice headset for gamers,  it is extremely comfortable, for long periods of use. Itbworks great with my PS5 as well.",2021,03
I liked the product all around overall,2021,03
Liked the color choices and style,2021,03
This is the perfect headset for gaming.,2021,03
These work wonderful for my husband whose a streamer and plays with a PlayStation 4,2021,03
"I had gotten these headphones for my son for when he is on the PlayStation 4 or his laptop and he enjoys it very much. He has not found a dislike to the headphones since getting them, they came in quality condition and are excellent. This product deserves 10 stars, because of how amazing these headphones are.",2021,03
Very good,2021,03
Love the Headset so far!!,2021,03
Feels and sounds better then expected! I like the mic switch for faster responses. Would buy again.,2021,03
I did not dislike anything it was amazing the sound quality was great and my kid loves it.,2021,03
"My son has only been using the headset for a few days,  but he likes it and it appears to be more durable than the Xbox brand (we've been through several of those in a short period of time).",2021,03
Comfortable headset!,2021,03
"I used this headset with my xbox one. Got it for $20 on a black friday deal, which was nice, though I guess I got what I paid for. Was lured in a little by the LED lights, and I was a bit disappointed to find out I wouldn't be able to use them, since they only activate when connected to a PC.The sound quality was as expected for a $50 headset: wasn't amazing, but was by no means terrible. The ear cuffs are definitely noise-blocking and they're surprisingly comfortable to wear, even if you wear glasses. Since I wear glasses, most headsets start to hurt my ears after a while; but I experienced no pain with this one.The mic was okay; never really had any problems with it. I did have slight problems with the volume control though; sometimes, it would catch/rub on my clothing and randomly turn the volume up or down. Wasn't that big of an issue, though, since it rarely happened.I'd say my only valid complaint was the letdown of only having it for 4 months before it died. I was really excited about this headset. The whole reason I bought it was so I could get something that would last me a bit longer than a cheap, $20-$30 headset would; but it barely lasted me four months. What's even worse is that I still currently have a $20 headset that has lasted longer! And I'm someone who takes care of all things electronic and electronic-related, so this was the result of the actual headset failing. Might have given it 4 or 5 stars had it been of use for just a little while longer.",2021,03
I wasn't expecting much from the gaming headset I got from Bengoo but they far exceeded my expectations. I like them better than previous gaming headphones purchased off amazon. Sound great and look great as well!,2021,03
Good,2021,03
My son liked these so far!,2021,03
"Pretty damn good, has nice volume and the mic sounds crisp and clear",2021,03
"I think it’s good. Sound quality isn’t bad, the mic isn’t bad either 👍",2021,03
good sound qualityfits my heads well,2021,03
The product was a lot more than I anticipated I am Very Pleased!,2021,03
Headset works great. Ear muffs are deep and large enough that they cover my ears fully with no pressure points. Normally when I wear a headset my ears start to hurt after 40 min or so; not the case with this headset. very comfortable to wear for long periods of time at the office or gaming sessions.,2021,03
Likes: Sound +Mic Quality,2021,03
I had my last one for 5 years. I ended up breaking it.. but I got another one and honestly for the price and how long it lasted as well as quality. It’s definitely a worth while buy. I gifted one to my little brother. I use this on my Xbox and little brother uses it on his PS4 or PC we never have any issues.,2021,03
So far so good. Everything works—speakers and microphone. Very happy with the purchase.,2021,03
Good for gaming and noice cancelling,2021,03
Look no further! These headphones are as good as much more expensive options for much less cost.,2021,03
 After reading a few reviews I decided to give this headset a try. When I put it on I immediately felt the comfort the were talking about. The quality that you get for the price makes it very much worthy. It isn't a name brand headset you find at game stop but it is comparable(Maybe better). 5 stars hands down.,2021,03
"Overall a good set of headphones. They are slightly tight for the wearer, so he avoids them when he has a headache.",2021,03
My family loves this brand,2021,03
Great for gaming! I like there are 2 input options. The headphones are really sturdy. The best part are the colored lights!,2021,03
Great quality headset for the price!!!,2021,03
Great product for the price,2021,03
Great product wonderful sound and noise cancellation.,2021,03
"Good fit,  sounds is good and great for gaming",2021,03
Little heavy is my only complaint otherwise very nice,2021,03
A little bulky but I like it!,2021,03
Awesome gaming headset!,2021,03
Great for gaming. Good sound. Only negative...sometimes wont come off mute without unplugging.,2021,03
My 12 year old loves them so far!,2021,03
Works good for the price.  A little tight on the ears after wearing for a few hours. Seems like they’ll take a bit of breaking them in to get comfortable.,2021,03
"Headset works as intended, and the mic quality is great",2021,03
Great product bought by mistake no bluetooth. Have to return it.,2021,03
"Crisp sound, better than Wal-Mart headsets I've been getting.",2021,03
Sounds good for gaming,2021,03
"I am very disappointed with my order! The headset worked for the first couple weeks and then stopped all of a sudden. You can slightly hear out of them, but you cannot use the mic at all. Will not be buying again.",2021,03
"Nice color, big and comfortable but doesn't feel heavy. Only dislike is that the LED lights don't work  unless you use the usb",2021,03
Good Headset for gaming.,2021,03
"I honestly don’t care for this at all. Sure it’s cute, but it’s not comfortable on the ears, the sound is not very loud and the quality is low. I have issues with it constantly where people can’t hear me, and I know it’s not the controller. Would not recommend.",2021,03
Love it!! Works great with the switch,2021,03
I use mine for gaming on the Xbox and I love it.,2021,03
It is amazing. I wanted to wait 2 days for any weird stuff or just a sign of cheap plastic but no. It passes the test. I want to congratulate them for their amazing microphone quality too.,2021,03
"The headset is a pretty good price, very easy to start using, and has a sleek cool design to match. It cancels out noise pretty good as well, for example, it blocks out the noise caused by a fan I have in my room. My only actual complaint is that it is kind of small ,like it covers my ears completely but only barely does it do that. If you are around 20 or younger it should be fine, but you may want a bigger size otherwise.",2021,03
Works great,2021,03
My son loves this headset! He can't hear me talking to him so no disruptions to his game. Sound quality is great but I don't have to hear the gameplay.,2021,03
For gaming,2021,03
"Good for gaming, my husband's likes them. cancelled the noise good, plus the light looks great in the dark! Will be buying more for our kids!!!",2021,03
"Bad ass headset, love it 10/10",2021,03
The game itself does not come through well but the other players do.  They are k but Iwill not buy again.,2021,03
Only thing I don’t like is how short the usb cord is to make the headset light up. Everything else is good.,2021,03
"I really like the glossy, shiny look to it. I love the color of the blue, and it fits pretty comfortably. I do think that the mic could come down a bit lower, it feels a little bit short.",2021,03
decent sound and the lights are cool,2021,03
"The audio is mostly decent but as soon as I started talking all my friends told me I sounded so badly I should go back to my old mic. Bad output, just slightly uncomfortable but not too bad overall",2021,03
"Super good quality microphone and headphones! I bought these to start streaming and the microphone only picks up my voice so I don't need to worry about background noise being picked up. The headphones themselves are also really amazing, crystal clear sound. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for an affordable and great quality headset!",2021,03
"I bought these for my 8 year old son who is a gamer and he loves them! He told me that they are comfy, sound great and look cool! I love how sturdy they feel too! Definitely a well-worth buy!",2021,03
"Love these headphones, it’s my third pair I’ve bought and the wife loves here’s and I have a pair for company. Quality is awesome and perfect for gaming!",2021,03
It is awesome. My son loves the lights and likes how it feels and sounds!,2021,03
Great all around headset,2021,03
Good for gaming,2021,03
I have purchased several of these headsets over the years. They are great quality and sound amazing. They even withstand teenage boys!! Highly recommend.,2021,03
Works great! Surprisingly it is also durable my 8 year old used them and throws them around!!!,2021,03
"These work well and the sound quality is good. They completely cover the ears and seem to be comfortable enough. They rest on the pad on top of the head and I would probably get tired of that with extended wear, but overall they are a good product at a good price.",2021,03
Honestly I love them and it’s not even for me!...they are just a couple of dollars more than usual headphones but buy these instead! The sound is so clear and the noise cancellation is good. I bought these for my fiancé for gaming and he loves them!,2021,03
"Only one side works wen your gaming, straight trash.",2021,03
It’s great,2021,03
These headphones Are amazing¡ they’re soundproof too. I love the price they’re very affordable and compatible with almost every console and pcs’so happy with my purchase. Will buy again¡,2021,03
"For its price, the headset worked very well. Although the design is quite flimsy and the earpieces were a bit too small, the sound quality was very good and it worked as intended.",2021,03
I love the way it sounds,2021,03
"This is exactly what I wanted. Comfortable, great sound, and a decent price. Definitely recommend!",2021,03
Our son loves it! Says it’s good and plays with his friends. Uses it on Nintendo switch to play Fortnite. Affordable def recommend it,2021,03
They're a little small but confortable to wear. The sound quality and noise cancelation is great!,2021,03
I liked that it had a mic for gaming and the sound quality was superb.,2021,03
Is sucks don’t get it,2021,03
The sound quality of this headset is amazing. I plugged it in to my pc and there is no crackling noises and when I talk friends and family there is no change or crackling in my voice.,2021,03
Clear sound quality,2021,03
Grape,2021,03
"I love these headphones, they’re perfect for my ps4. Thanks!",2021,03
Got them for use with my children who seem to destroy headphones by looking at them. Integrated mic works well for class and they are comfortable enough to be worn or the whole school day. The cord is long enough it's not getting yanked out all the time and it feels more durable than some of the thin wires on most inexpensive sets.,2021,03
"Can barely hear myself talk with them on, huge plus!",2021,03
"These headsets (I bought 2 pairs) didn’t even work right the first time either were used... Clicking the sound button does nothing to shut the sound off, nor does switching the mic part up. There are just time while playing CoD where everyone DOES NOT need to hear my background noise... One of the pairs got stuck all the way extended and I can’t get it to go back in. All in all I’d say invest a bit more money and get a nicer pair...",2021,03
I really liked it. I can hear people clearly and hear the game great and know whats going on around me in the game. Ourside noise does not distract me at all,2021,03
I bought these headphones on a lightning sale wanting a decentish set of headphones with a mic. I’m pleasantly surprised with the good quality of the input and output. Would recommend if you’re looking for a good set of headphones without breaking the bank.,2021,03
Great headset,2021,03
"Just received the headset , sound looks good . I think its worth the price  .",2021,03

Works great and has excellent sound,2021,03
Very good for fortnite for a mic.,2021,03
I am very pleased with the order and would recommend buying it for anyone looking for a good gaming headset!,2021,03
Works great. Can use to talk on iPhone with adaptor.,2021,03
Very high quality,2021,03
These headphones work great. The mic is decent but the sound quality is the best part of these headphones.,2021,03
Good fit,2021,03
Works great well worth the price. Bought for my son and he loves it,2021,03
"I should have read closely but the USB is for the lights. I thought it was for the output, which is not compatible. However, we had to do adjustments on the computer to get the audio to work.",2021,03
Great birthday gift for my granddaughter,2021,03
"Purchased one of these just wanted something decent, ended up with Awesome.  High quality construction and great sound quality.  I like the dual plug option so I can seamlessly move from PS to PC and back.  Good buy.",2021,03

The product is used for gaming.,2021,03
I love this product,2021,03
Great gaming headset for my son!,2021,03
It works perfect with PS4 controller.  Great value.,2021,03
"If you want cheap, you get cheap. Cool to look at, long wire, but nouse cancellation sucks and noise quality is not that great. The wire is also very fragile. Tried two pairs thinking maybe the wire problem was a fluke. No, it's a problem with the product.",2021,03
"Great sound. Not completely sound canceling, but not a bad thing as my partner is always trying to get my attention and now if he's close enough I can still hear him over the game. The mic works great and sounds clear. The cable is long and slightly cumbersome as the mute/volume panel is Huge. But overall it's a great headset. Would purchase again.",2021,03
Efficient for its price,2021,03
Sooooooo good. Noise canceling is perfect!!!1,2021,03
Inexpensive and good quality,2021,03

Quick, easy setup and then it was straight to using them. I have connected them to my pc, my PS4, and have used them for just music. Great and clear sound across the board!",2021,03
Got these for my 10 year old son who wanted some “gaming headphones”. He gave the reviews. Said they are great.,2021,03
No echo !,2021,03
"Use for gaming, like that they reduce outside noise and surround sound is great!",2021,03
Only problem is the usb to get the headset to light up is too short,2021,03
Good headset,2021,03
"I have yet to be disappointed by Bengoo products, and this follow suit! The sound is absolutelyphenomenal, and these are COMFORTABLE! The moment I felt the head cushion when removing it from the packaging, I was shocked at how soft it was!For very affordable gaming needs with high-end  quality, you HAVE to use Bengoo!!!",2021,03

I just am having trouble hooking it up to my xbox controller,2021,03
"The headset works great as far as sound quality and noise control. The only down sides are that the cord is too long and the remote control is a big big, could get in the way.",2021,03
Headset is comfortable and great sound quality,2021,03
I love everything about these headphones. They have a great design and the noise cancellation is amazing. The fun thing is they have cool LED lights. Would buy again.,2021,03

Very good. Nice sound & mic doesn't have problems,2021,03
My boyfriend loved them,2021,03
I like that I can cancel out all the background noise and distractions when I play on my ps4.,2021,03
It didn’t work with the switch I had to return it,2021,03
"No one can hear my partner through the microphone! We’ve tried on his ps4, phone, and laptop.",2021,03
Bought for my sons bday. Thought it was wireless. He is still happy with it.,2021,03
I love it. great to use.,2021,03
Horrible product stopped working day 2.We returned this microphone twice and both stopped working. 2nd one stopped  working within a month. The 3rd time we tried returning they wouldn’t process the refund. Amazon is turning into wish. My little boy was so disappointed as was I. I miss the old Amazon.,2021,03
"I ordered this headset back in November and the microphone stopped working in February. It was a Christmas gift for my son and he was only able to use it from January-February. The headset stopped after only 30 days. I couldn't return it because it was past the return window so I ordered another one last week. It arrived on 3/18/21 and AGAIN it's defective and the microphone doesn't work. This is incredibly frustrating that I've had the same problem twice with a product that is considered a best seller with 20,000 + positive reviews.",2021,03
It came quicker than expected the quality is great and the price is reasonable I’m over satisfied with my headset❤️❤️,2021,03
I really appreciate the consistency of sound within the mouse. It's also multiple compatible,2021,03
Great value,2021,03
My first gaming headset. I love it,2021,03
Its really sleek and easy to use. It can be used with almost any thing including a phone.,2021,03
"You sound very terrible on this headset, you can't mute yourself, even with doing the mic mute switch,  and your sound is very quiet compared to other head sets, it's cheaper than most head sets but their are some big setbacks, would not buy again 2/10 would not recommend",2021,03
Gaming headset was perfect for boys that are not always careful,2021,03
Good quality for gaming,2021,03
I think it’s great for gaming although the cord is a bit heavier it’s not a big problem. Love the headset!,2021,03
My son loves it,2021,03
"If you own an Xbox or PS gaming console, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this headset!!  Does it work with either gaming system?  TECHNICALLY, yes, you can plug it into your controller and use the microphone and speakers to play games.  HOWEVER, you will NOT be able to plug the USB into your controller for the LED lights.  The dual plugs are designed to be used on a computer gaming system.  You would have to get a very long USB extension cord to plug into your console.Unless you own a PC gaming system, SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy something another headset!",2021,03
Great quality for the price,2021,03
"Noise Cancellation is okay, its not bad but its not amazing but overall the sound quality is really good and the headphones feel very high quality. Its really good for the price.",2021,03

Would definitely buy again and recommend to others! Also really liked how there is a headphone jack and a usb to use to plug into your electronics!",2021,03
"Pretty cool my boy like it, works very well with the Nintendo switch.",2021,03
The product worked great for a day and then suddenly stopped. Took me 20 minutes of fiddling to get the headphones to work again and I couldn't get the mic working. Wouldn't recommend. I'm going to try returning the product and hopefully will have a better experience.,2021,03
Was good,2021,03
"Amazing noise cancellation, and the sound quality is great too! I highly recommend this to anybody looking for a pair of gaming headphones, or even just headphones in general! Five stars!",2021,03

"This product is amazing for consoles such as ps4 or Xbox I use the microphone for my ps4 and my friends love it they are trying to get their own pair for themselves right now, I really like the mic quality, and the noise suspension there is barely any background noise!

"Got this for me and my boyfriend, he really likes them and i like them as well they are very loud kinda hurts my ears, and mic quality is also great! Definitely recommend",2021,03
It is very comfortable and does not hurt ears like others do.,2021,03
Husband loves them. He loves how it cancels our noise. Which means he can’t hear me or the dog while he’s wearing them.,2021,03
Excellent for gaming amd music!,2021,03

"For the price it's very good quality, its not too heavy but not so light that it feels cheap. I like the cord length and the cushions feel good on my ears.",2021,03
This headset is really nice. Only big thing is that you can't use the mic and lights at the same time it's one or the other. The mic makes me sound really clear and I love how you can hear bass clearly.,2021,03
" Updated review: I edited the review because the company responded to their marketing promotion after a while. I just gave it to my nephew a few days ago and he really likes it.-----------------------------------------------I bought this headset for my nephew for his gaming purpose.

The headsey is very good for gaming the mic works great people on the other side have said they can hear me more clearly and i can hear them more clearly with the amazing sound quality and when i put it on and play something i can almost always only hear whats in the headset. Over all i would definitely buy this again.,2021,03
Good sound but as much definition as it can be expected for the price.,2021,03
These served me well for a few years. I have large ears so I had to seek out another pair but if you have small to medium ears these will do you right.,2021,03
For gaming,2021,03

Mixes really well with the whole game experience from footsteps to bullets . Highly recommend this product for your gaming needs.,2021,03

Very useful. I play online games and it works for that. I’m very happy with my purchase. :),2021,03
"The packaging was very nice, the box is a high quality box that won’t get damaged during shipping. The overall appearance when first seeing the headset was 10/10.

This valid,2021,03
Comfortable headset!!!!,2021,03
Great clarity,2021,03
I got these for my son to use for his switch and he loves them. I like that you can control the volume on them and turn the mic on and off. They also cancel a lot of the background noise so it is easier for you to concentrate and hear the game.,2021,03
Bought this for my son and he is in heaven with it. He enjoys the colors but wishes it would light up on his xbox.,2021,03
"I don't game that intensely, more of a hobby to stay in touch with out-of-town friends. This headset was affordable, and definitely fits my needs!",2021,03
Beautiful sound beautiful price beautiful look. I am pleased,2021,03
It very good,2021,03
They work great for schoolwork and gaming.,2021,03
The product description is correct and I found nothing wrong with the headset.  It has both a pin jack and a USB connector on the end.  It did not work quickly on my PC.  I did not do any problem-solving because I did not like the fit.  the pads are oval and not as soft as I wanted.  I wear glasses and so they pushed my ear around the glasses and were uncomfortable for me.There was nothing wrong with them they just were not for me.,2021,03
It is a great headset for my son! He loves it!,2021,03
"For this headset you have to constantly push the mouth piece as close to your mouth as possible, which doesn't really work well because the mic piece itself is plastic and when you are gaming you can't constantly have 1 hand holding the mic, when u need that hand for the game. Extreme caution when buying this. It's sound is good by itself but the mic part is awful. Will not be purchasing again.",2021,03
The cord has already broken but before that they were great. I gave them to my preteen son for Christmas and he seemed to love them.,2021,03
"Great value, works amazing, definitely worth the money",2021,03
The mic sounded as if I were trying to communicate with you from another level in the house.,2021,03
This headset gave way more than i expected. Very happy with my purchase. and it’s also super cute,2021,03
"Very nice, my son loves them.",2021,03
Forget all the other expensive headsets. This one does it all for much less. My kid has been so happy with the headset. He recommended to all his friends. You wont be disappointed.,2021,03
Good for the price,2021,03
very good for gaming,2021,03
"Legitimately the thing that mattered most to me was that the cord was all covered so I wouldn't get the exposed wire situation, and these have full rope-like coverage. These have that, and they also have great sound quality.",2021,03
The only thing I dislike is the wire getting tangled.,2021,03
Great. Good for gaming.,2021,03
"Very goo mic, and the sound quality is good.",2021,03
it was fire I would definitely consider purchasing again!,2021,03
"This headset is complete garbage.... The usb plug wouldn't work, only lights up the headset. Using the audio plug the sound is staticy and you can barely hear at full volume. Listening to a music video to test the sound was chopping cutting out the artists voice all over the place.Worst headset I have ever used. Opened a return immediately!",2021,03
Awesome product. Buy it now.,2021,03
"I am very happy with the sound quality out of the box. It would be nice to be able to turn the bass dow a bit but, it isn't overwhelming. For the price, this is a winner.",2021,03
"Kids said they look like an awesome space set, They Love their new gaming headsets.",2021,03
Feels great and looks great! Sounds of the game come through clear and room noises are almost nothing!,2021,03

These headphones are really good I can hear everything in the game and the noise outside can barley be heard. Id wish it came with a stand option but outside if it the product is good,2021,03

"The headphones are used by my son mainly for his classes, they are very comfortable to spend a lot of time listening to them, without being distracted by external noises. He also uses it for games.  He does not need to be connected to his pc, he can listen to his classes away from home or even camping, connected to his smartphone. He is very happy with these.",2021,03
"Works well, my 8 year old loves it for Fortnite so he can chat with friends while playing.",2021,03
"for me personally, the best thing about the headphones was the crystal clear mic, although, the noise cancellation and audio were definitely exceptional as well",2021,03
"This headset for gaming is one you should get it does not cost that much and is worth it, I say if you are looking at it just buy it because it is worth it.",2021,03
"I've had them 5 minutes, haven't even plugged them in yet, but they are very comfortable. I think it's odd that the extension part above each ear only slides in and out just a tiny bit. I would have thought quality headphones would give you more room for adjustment. Just a thought.",2021,03
nice,2021,03
Pretty strong i luv the mic but volume should be able to turn alil more than u allow to also the cord is long enough & they are comfortable around my ears,2021,03
"For gaming, the mic works nice and connects to Xbox one controller very comfortable on ears, great sound quality.",2021,03
" This may not be a professional headset, but if your not a professional, this is the right headset for you.",2021,03

Got these headphones for gaming. Absolutely love them!,2021,03
Okay had these for 3 days now and I'm giving it a 3 out of five because the USB and the audio jack is too close together good thing I had a USB extender which I plugged into my PlayStation and the controller in the LED lights did not come on so I took the extender off and plugged it in by itself the lights still did not come on despite that the sound quality is good but not as loud as I would like but you do get great sound they are pretty good for a gaming headset in music as well all in all I say yes there were the price.,2021,03

Very nice! Works great!,2021,03
For the price this headset is a good quality product. It sounds great when in Simulation games. The foam ear pads are great when playing for a few hours. Well made with a volume control in the cord that plugs into the PC.,2021,03
This product came on time as expected. I am satisfied with my purchase as it is well worth the money.,2021,03
Dont get them,2021,03
These worked for exactly 2 days then died! No wonder they were marked down so much. These were purchased for use with an iPad which it says they are compatible. Very disappointing considering the amount of positive reviews!,2021,03
Works wonderful. Son jumps up and down a lot while playing so the extra length cord is great!,2021,03

It’s very comfortable on your ears and it doesn’t add any static. The sound control is very good and the mic works very well.,2021,03
This device is simply awesome for gaming!!!😎,2021,03
"Overall the headphones felt like a plastic toy you’d buy from the dollar store.. there is no noise cancellation because they don’t close around your ears completely. Not sure if this is a flaw in design or I got a pair that was made incorrectly, but either way save your money. For this price you can get something 100% better and not have to go through the hassle of returning it or the disappointment of thinking you’re getting something good for the price.",2021,03
Headphones were decent except didn’t really cancel out any noise.,2021,03
I got this head set for my son for his xbox. He loves how comfortable it is and he said the sound is amazing. He can now chat with his friends while playing his games.,2021,03

It’s alright! I thought the LED lights would come on. I didn’t know you had to plug in a USB in order for them to work. I was so excited to give them to my boyfriend. But was a little disappointed about the lights. Other than that it’s amazing!!,2021,03

they break easily,2021,03
I bought this headset as the third replacement for my 12 year old who tends to be tough on electronics. He loves the fact that it lights up and it drowns out noise. He says that it comfortable and sounds great. He has only had it a short time but it is still holding up pretty well. We will see how great the durability is in time.,2021,03
Amazing quality that’s not expensive,2021,03
Love these,2021,03
"These headphones comfortable, good sound quality, and decent noise cancellation. I would recommend it",2021,03

Really nice headset sounds good and all. The cable is extremely long. Came all twisted up and the sound would cut if I tried to untangle it . So had to return it .,2021,03
I think it's a good choice for a starting out product. It's fairly good for the pricing and fits up to my expectations. Fits nicely and doesn't hurt my ears like most headsets do.,2021,03

Hubby loves them,2021,03

This is a very good product,2021,03
Got these for both the hubby and kiddo! They are pretty great!,2021,03

"Very good quality headphones, great for gaming. While playing and using it is noise cancelling which is amazing. definitely should buy",2021,03
Noise canceling is great!,2021,03
"Didn’t work for my PS4. Total waste of money, going with turtle beach headsets for my next gaming headset purchase.",2021,03
"He really likes the headset, but they hurt his ears a bit after a while of use.",2021,03
this is great for gaming for kids but when us parents want to get their attention ha ha ha they can't hear us! great headset,2021,03
"It's pretty comfortable and the noise canceling is pretty good! It's great for gamers, especially starting gamers, and younger gamers. However, i'm not sure if it's just me because I have a smaller head but they could look a little funny/big when wearing. Also, when playing, sometimes the people that i'm talking to don't really hear me well at times or can sound low/soft. Another thing I noticed is that when it's plugged into my controller, it sometimes make a loud static noise often. I'm not sure if it's because of the cord not being put right by myself or because of the cord itself.",2021,03
surprised how sharp it looked when first seeing it but it is even better than it looks!!,2021,03
"Works great on Xbox for gaming, highly recommending this product to all.",2021,03
I like the way the headphones feel and look it doesnt get better it was cheap and nice in quality.,2021,03
These are great gaming headphones for the price.  My son loves the blue lights and they work great!,2021,03
"My child, who is an avid gamer,just unboxed it and it DOES NOT WORK! WASTE OF MONEY! I WILL BE RETURNING!",2021,03

It was a Christmas gift so far my nephew love it,2021,03
"I recommend these because they are great for sound and gaming.  They are comfortable but they aren't the best I have ever had as far as comfort goes.  Overall, they are great quality.",2021,03
My kids love it,2021,03
I bought this for my 10 year old son who lives across the country and we game together on the xbox. He loves it all around but i gave it a 4 star only because there's a low hum that comes thru from his end. Id buy again.,2021,03
"Really surprised with this headset, my turtle beaches went out and I bought these as a cheap replacement. Tried it out today and it works above and beyond of what I thought I'd get for $30. The mic is good and clear but what shined for me was the noise cancellation and base that had a nice kick to it. Very happy with it.",2021,03
Good quality and nice look,2021,03
"I like it, but a bit uncomfortable need bigger ear cups.",2021,03
"Ordered yesterday, received today. Sweet looking headphones, great design. Most important is the sound though and its fantastic. The bass is strong, sound is clear and no distortion when turned all the way up. Very pleased.",2021,03
bad audio input,2021,03
This headset works great it cancels out background sound  and the mic sounds great!,2021,03
Great product!,2021,03
"While it isn't on par with some of the more expensive headsets out there, for the value that it was give ($25 discounted), this is a good pair of headsets that helps for those that want to get into the video gaming craze.  This pair of headphones is big, so size should be covered for those with big, round heads.  While the game audio is a bit filled with bass at times, the quality outside of that is really good, and the size comes to an advantage again as it helps with noise cancellation both in mic and in speakers.  If you can get the same deal I did, I recommend it for a first-timer.",2021,03
Bought them for hubby for gaming on the PS4 he loves them!,2021,03
The noise quality is really good also the way I can hear it is really good also my friends all ask me what mic I have because it’s so good,2021,03
Works for Nintendo switch,2021,03
Very good choice for your first pair of gaming headphones. The sound is perfect and the mic quality is very clean. Doesn't hurt your head after being worn for a long time either.,2021,03
"Ordered this for my son, as typical headphones seem to not last long with him. I read other reviews on this gaming head set and decided to give it a shot.  They came the very next day as advertised and the packaging well protected the product. When giving them to my son his eyes lit up and he was very excited! I think he thinks we paid a lot more than what we did for them! The sound quality and microphone are great!! Not sure about the noise canceling, he normally leaves one ear uncovered to be able to hear his surroundings. All in all, a great product, fast delivery, and very happy kid!",2021,03
Good headset,2021,03
I enjoy everything about it!,2021,03
Good sound quality not as much noise cancellation,2021,03
It is a good mic,2021,03
Love my headphones for ps4 very good in anything u play,2021,03
Very good for gaming on my PC.,2021,03
"Haven’t had much time to use it yet, but like it so far.",2021,03
For gaming I like the noise cancellation. I like the surround sound especially for gaming,2021,03
Bought these for my son and he loves them!  He says they're really comfortable and the sound quality is good.,2021,03
Love this product comfort noise cancellation great for gaming,2021,03
Comfortable headset and a solid upgrade from my previous.,2021,03
"Used these for gaming for my son, quality is great!",2021,03
I love the sound quality. This is a great product for the price.,2021,03
Not the best headphones I've purchased. Doesn't provide the same quality for headphones less the price.,2021,03
There’s nothing I disliked . I used it for gaming .The noise cancellation was amazing and I love the sound quality.,2021,03
"Honestly, this product is super good, especially for the price. My brother has his own pair of gaming headphones. They are a different brand that cost about 70$. I would say that this for a lot cheaper sounds better and fits better than his. If you needed one real fast, I would say buying this would be a good option. That's what I did. I was having problems in class with my mic so I had to buy new headphones and this did the job!!",2021,03
My son loved this headset!,2021,03
"Really great product,it came on time and it was of great quality thanks so much",2021,03
"I loved the sound cancelation for the audio, and the mic is awesome, it also has lights on the side which is cool at night.",2021,03
Shown new & work with PS4 - works (barely) but requires cord to be plugged into USB port for lights. Sound was terrible. Box condition showed headset had at best been repackaged & at worst repaired & sold as new! DoN't wast your time or money on these!,2021,03
Perfect my son loves them,2021,03
"I was kind of skeptical for only $25 but definitely worth the price. They are comfortable, decent noise canceling, and they look good too. 5 stars",2021,03
"Don’t get me wrong, it’s an excellent headset...however it’s just uncomfortable. Maybe it’s just me but the actual headphone piece is just a little bit too small.",2021,03
Working good.  Made sturdyHappy with purchase,2021,03
Perfect for game nights,2021,03
Son loves the headset. Great price.,2021,03
Awesome,2021,03
I use this for work and it is great! Exactly as described with both USB and jack for my laptop. The wire is super long so I can get up from my desk when using. And the padding on the earpieces is super comfortble.,2021,03
It works really well and I have no problem with it !,2021,03
I like how it even though its not as flexible around the band that it doesn't feel like a giant hunk of weight on my head. The sound feels pretty good and it comes with multiple ports to use it.,2021,03
It stopped working my is very disappointed,2021,03
"My 11 yr. old loves this gaming headset! I purchased these after the wires in his last one tore up. I was over buying headsets until I came across these with the thick cable cord, instead of the thin plastic wire cord. I decided to give it a try after reading several reviews. I’m glad that I did. The mic is clear, the cord is thicker, and the headset lights up blue to match my son’s gaming keyboard and mouse. Great reviews from kids and adults, fast shipping, and at a very affordable price. Do not pass this up!",2021,03
This product is the best I’ve seen,2021,03
I love the colors for the headset. It works like a charm.,2021,03

"Totally worth it. Very good product, It was a gift for my brother and he loved it.The sound quality is great.",2021,03
It came in great shape and sound quality is better than my old set.,2021,03
The headphones were nice I do appreciate the the fact it has a Mic attached and they are pretty comfy on my head and its fits tightly on my head so I don't have to worry about it falling off or anything so it's good for gaming when you need to focus. Its one of those headphones that has two cords for phone and pc plugins which is slightly annoying since I don't have a pc but since it does have one its good for those that have and play pc games,2021,03
the quality was really good,2021,03
"We just purchased these headphones yesterday. Received prompt next day delivery. The packaging is nice, headphones look great. Easy use, sound is good has good base. Noise cancelling is also good. Will be using them for gaming today.",2021,03

Need to use it when my computer comes in for a valid review but looks good,2021,03
I bought this headset multiple years ago and I have used it consistently for every device I own. Up to this day it still working at 100% and it was the best 30$ I had ever spent.,2021,03
"I have a small head! But that isn't anyone's fault... It just doesn't fit well, even on the smallest setting the ear pieces rest too low. Which probably wouldn't be a big issue, but I have glasses as well and it presses to hard on my glasses. I just think they could have designed it with more flex in the size expansion thingies is all. Otherwise its good.",2021,03
Bought it for my son he loves it great quality!! Works great for PlayStation 4,2021,03
Nice Product!,2021,03

Haven’t tried it yet but looks accurate,2021,03

EXCELLENT HEADSET WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.. LOVE THEM!,2021,03
This product came fast and has worked well,2021,03

I enjoyed the audio quality and durability of this headset. It is a good thing to get for your money.,2021,03
Loved them,2021,03
"When playing with friends they can barely hear me, even when I speak loudly. The mic itself is very short and only come halfway down my cheek with no way to extend it. Non functional for online play. The sound is fine, the quality of the mic as a whole isn't great, but for $25 not bad. DO NOT BUY FOR ONLINE PLAY.",2021,03
"What I really like is about these headsets is that it have metal plates on them which so they cannot break which is better than plastic, plus the bands are not tight so it also doesn't break easily. The LED is simple but unique in a way as you can play games and watch youtube at night since you can glow and look pretty cool. The sound quality is pretty good to me as I hear better than my old ps4 headset. The soft cushion fits on my head so that's a plus. The wires are long which is really helpful when I move away.",2021,03
"Good for gaming, as advertised",2021,03
Great packaging! Quick and efficient shipping and came in great condition. Good bang for your buck highly recommend.,2021,03

Very comfortable to wear and it was a great deal for a starter headset it had everything I needed and wanted,2021,03
We received the headset today. My 11 year old son put them on to play but the ear muffs are way to small. They hurt his ears. My husband and I also tried them on to see what he was talking about when he said they hurt and they actually do hurt your ears.,2021,03
This headset was amazing to use. The sound quality is excellent and all of my friends use it and love it. I would definitely get this again if needed.,2021,03

I bought them as a gift and the reciever was incredibly happy to be on the other end using these. I'm extremely happy with the product. Will recommend.,2021,03
Great sound quality headphones for gaming. Can hear everything in the game super clear. Noise cancelation from outside noised. Would definitely recommend these headphones.,2021,03
"I found the headset to be stylish, comfortable and affordable.  The soft padding for our ear and the top of the head provide long term comfort while gaming.  The design puts me in hard core game mode while the lights further  submerge me in game mode.",2021,03
"He is so happy with his headphones, he is a gamer and definetely never hears me come in the room lol",2021,03
The only thing I didn't like about this headset is I'm using it on the PS4 and there's no way to plug in the headset to the controller and plug the USB the the system for the lights.,2021,03
A pretty nice Headset for anyone trying to go for one cheap.,2021,03

"Bought this headset for gaming! It's comfortable on the ears (good because when I play, I tend to play for a looong time!) and has high quality sound and microphone.  The only con is that it is mostly plastic.",2021,03
Mix did not work upon arrival,2021,03
Great headphones for a good price!!!,2021,03
It sounds amazing at a low price,2021,03
I'm disappointed about this product is not loud enough for me especially I'm deaf.....,2021,03
"Feels like a surround-sound theater. Granted I've never used an expensive set and have only known the sound quality from free earbuds that came with my phones. But for the price, this is great. Foam paddings are also really soft.",2021,03
"I was looking for another headset because the one I was using wasn’t working how it should and when I saw this one with all the good reviews I decided to try it and this headset rocks for the price, I love the sound dial and the mute switch, I use it for PS4 but the lights would be cool if I were on PC. Pretty light weight and it overall seems like it’s a decent quality headset! Would definitely buy again if something happens to this one.",2021,03
It’s cool.,2021,03
My son likes the headphones. He said they are really comfortable and works with his laptop and game.,2021,03
Awsome headset,2021,03

This headset is very light weight and quality is very good. Lights on side looks the headset very nice. Good product for your money.,2021,03
I enjoy the BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset mostly for the noise cancellation and the Comfy Ear Cushion makes hearing the game much better as my were ears are less tired after a long gaming session.,2021,03
Gff,2021,03

For my son and he loves it,2021,03
It's my first gaming headset and it's pretty good tbh,2021,03
Worked perfectly,2021,03
"I am a 39 year old woman with a small head. I have a hard time even finding retail hats that fit me. So I have a horrible time finding any kind of headphones that fit and/or are not painful. I only just got these, and on the smallest setting they mostly fit. I could honestly have them just a little smaller and be perfect but at least these are not squeezing my head like a vice as so many do. The ear pieces go all the way around my ears so they are also not squeezing my ears which is painful. I think they will be ok for long periods of use because they do not hurt. The sound quality seems fine, I'm hearing surround sound in my game as I type this. My voice comes out clear as does those I am chatting with. It's easy to mute myself as well and change the volume right from the headset. Over all I think these are really good quality! And a great price!The lights are pretty, although I doubt I will bother using them since I do not stream, and I only have two usb ports on my laptop anyway.",2021,03
Does not work don’t waste your time $,2021,03
head set came quickly and was great for compatibility. great value for money,2021,03
The sound quality is perfect. Definitely the defining feature. I was playing a FPS where it was raining in game and I had to stop to check if it was coming from outside. The rest of the headset is easy to use for PC and console gaming. Would definitely recommend for any gamer,2021,03
My 8 year old son loves this headset. He just received it for his birthday. We haven't texted all of the features and aren't sure if the mic works yet but he's still enjoying it.Update: mic works and he's very happy with the gift.,2021,03
Really great headphones! I use them to play on nintendo and they work just perfect ! would definitely recommend,2021,03
This headset is very good for how much it costs. It is very good for children that sit down and play video games for a while.,2021,03
Got this as a surprise gift. Really Really good headphones for gaming. Works all systems. I have a PS4 and have not been dissatisfied since day one using them,2021,03

Bought these for my son for Christmas and he loves them.  These are the only headphones he uses. Highly recommend!,2021,03
Sounds good :),2021,03
Really brings the sound to life. The sound quality is by far the best compared to other headsets.,2021,03
"Overall my son is very satisfied with his headphones.  He uses the with his Nintendo Switch, and the sound quality is very good for the budget price these headphones go for. The microphone is average, so nothing special. The lights look neat, and they are very comfortable. If you're looking for a budget pair of Gaming headphones, I would recommend.",2021,03
Such a great headsets my boyfriend loved them!!,2021,03
The headset is extremely comfortable and works great. It also looks amazing so I strongly recommend.,2021,03
Bought for Christmas for video games and already they don't work only 3 months later,2021,03
I works great! It fits really good on my head. The sound is really good too.,2021,03
These are so amazing gaming headphones i love them i cant hear any noise this product is great,2021,03
These headphones are comfortable and affordable. The quality is average but it is good enough for the price.,2021,03
The sound for the headset it loud and there is no bass.,2021,03
Got mine for Ps4. Everything works really well. Sound quality and noise-canceling are both really good for the price.,2021,03
"Great headphones at a great price. Sounds good, the noise cancelation is okay and plugs right in to my PS4.",2021,03
I liked the color,2021,03
I can hear everything in my games now and also can’t hear my gf yelling at me to get off the game while I have them on,2021,03
I bought these headphones for my nephew. He says that he likes the sound. The material seems sturdy enough. They are confortable and can be use with any device.,2021,03
It’s comfortable it has mute and for you to control the volume,2021,03
"Quality was great, haven’t had any issues and it’s durable",2021,03
"My son loves his headset, I would definitely order again. He can hear clearly and is heard clearly.",2021,03
it's very small.I really enjoyed the sleek design of it.But I think I'll have to give this to my kid.Yeah the padding is soft but very firm. Maybe my ears are too big? Cause it hurts to wear after a long period of time (max 3 hours)The microphone isn't great for what I wanted. I'm just too soft spoken of a person for this to work for me. Probably cause the mic is stiff and I can't get it any closer to my face. This purchase was a learning experience for me.,2021,03
My son loves these!,2021,03
"I am using mine with my gaming computer, and to watch movies. The noise cancelling feature is superior to my last couple of sets. Very satisfied!",2021,03
There great loved them,2021,03
I used the product for gaming and streaming. Have not had a issue yet and I would recommend purchasing these for any gamers.,2021,03
"I love it!!!, the headset is pretty cool and it sounds nice",2021,03
Great headphones excellent sound quality,2021,03
"Yeah, I know it's relatively cheap, but I didn't expect it to be that feeble.  The sound and recording quality is pretty bad.  I might as well just talk through a laptop's open mic.  Even with software noise suppression, the listening quality is pretty awful - worthless for music listening.  The mic itself is has poor response and acquisition.Then there's the USB which is only used to light the headset's LEDs up....really?Just shabby.",2021,03
Excellent detailed sound for video games. I’d say if you have an average vizio tv like me these headphones are a better quality experience. Very comfy. They really surround my ears completely. The mic arm is very tight & stable.  The tangle free chord feels like cloth.,2021,03
So far they work great! Great price!,2021,03
The best headset it is really good!,2021,03
"I got these for my husband to use on Zoom while he works from home. He loves that he can’t hear our kids in the background and that he hears the people he’s talking with very clearly. He says he is made fun of daily, though, for the size of these headphones. His clients and colleagues constantly ask him if he’s become a gamer. They also crack jokes about him being an air traffic controller. I’ve offered to find him new headphones but he has declined. He takes the poking fun in stride and sees it as an icebreaker for his work sessions with his clients and colleagues. Overall, a great purchase. Wish I had gotten them for him a year ago when he first started working from home.",2021,03
"Great product, shipped fast and was ready right out the box. Also comes with the adapter which is nice since I didn't have to buy it!",2021,03
"It's a great head set. Good sound. Easy to use. I did receive a funny , but weird bonus, a used acrylic nail tip. So, some one out there is missing a piece of their manicure. Picture included.",2021,03
My son really likes Tham good sound and microphone works well.,2021,03
"Great headset, especially for the money. Very satisfied.",2021,03
"I picked this up so I could play the Xbox games via the mobile cloud app they provide. I Use this headset with my One S controller (via the 3.5 plug) to play the games I enjoy and talk on chat playing my online games.The headset fits wonderfully on my ears, not too tight, not loose. however, the ear coverings do not cancel out the noise as my other set does at home. Since this is an on-the-go-out in the public headset, I consider this a good thing as it lets me hear the close things happening around me and such.The headset is light enough to not feel like a giant weight on my head and feels sturdy enough to be durable for packing around in a messenger bag with my phone and controller. I have a thick vinal bag when traveling I keep these in to keep them from getting damaged or dirty.The sound is adequate on these (don't expect phenomenal quality sound like a high-priced headset.) The audio is clear and directional based on input from the games and such so I can know what direction my team and enemies are in.With that being said, the glow feature really isn't necessary but is very bright and attention-getting when plugged into a USB port (which just runs the LED lights in the earphones.) The bright blue would look really good on a live stream or lets play if you do that sort of thing.For the price I paid, I hope these hold up with the constant going and moving around that I do through the week.I'll come back when/if they finally break/fail to finish this review up and give input into the durability.",2021,03
This is a great product for the price.  Am not disappointed.,2021,03
"These ended up being a bit of a disappointment. We got them for our son for Christmas and we didn't realize that in order for the lights to work, the cord ALSO needs to be plugged into a USB port. He was using them mostly with a tablet so this was a bummer. Now, only three months later the cord has completely severed and they don't work at all. These have had extremely light wear and tear, never leaving the house and only used for a couple hours a day.",2021,03
I love these headphones! Noise cancelling is amazing especially for when your gaming. No glitches so far with the sound quality. Would totally recommend these!,2021,03
I like this headset a lot because it helps me out a lot with gaming and just using it for work. It is really comfy. And when it comes to gaming it is a nice headset to use. I give this a 5/5. Ive had this over 4 months now and it is a really great product. Nothing bad happened.,2021,03
"its very good, comes with lights to spice up your gaming setup and works with any console,PC,laptop. Higly recommend 100%.",2021,03
Last me a long time never have any problems,2021,03
I was impressed.  They sound really good.  I wish it didn’t have the usb plug for the lights but not a big deal.,2021,03
They are good excellent product. Highly recommend. Good sound. My kids use them all the time.,2021,03
Works well does what it supposed to do,2021,03
it is a good headset and is good sound quality. Great for all types of games. Especially Minecraft.,2021,03
Really not the best,2021,03
Headphones were excellent for my gaming needs. Sound and mic quality were very impressive.,2021,03
"It works very well, the only thing is I cannot get the led lights to light up.",2021,03
Would’ve been really dope if the lights would have worked when I plugged it up instead of needing another power source but overall they’re decent,2021,03
This Headset was great for gaming and gave lots of comfort. The noise cancelation was pretty good and the sound quality and also nice. Overall good headset.,2021,03
Great product,2021,03
"The sound quality is excellent, it cancelled all sounds",2021,03
Bought this one for my daughter because I am so happy with mine. We use it for gaming together from different rooms and have no problems at all. Noise cancellation is okay but not 100%. Considering getting another one for my wife.,2021,03
i bought it for my son. awesome so far!,2021,03
"It is easy to setup, just plug in the two adapters that it comes with to the PC and the PC  recognizes the mike and headset. I am happy with what I got, so far I dont have any problems with it at the moment.",2021,03
Great set of headphones for the gamers I’m our house! Fit and sound are great my grandkids love the comfort. I feel the sound and mic are good.,2021,03
Got these for my husband for gaming and he loves them! I tried them on and the sound quality is a lot better than I had expected for the price! Great quality for a great price!,2021,03
This product doesn’t hurt my ears like most headphones!,2021,03
I use this set for my work office.  I work remotely and am in meetings all the time and this headset is very comfortable and works great.  My wife and dogs are in the house and the noise cancellation works great (obviously not for the microphone when you aren't on mute!).Great buy.  Recommended to co-worker and you as well.,2021,03
Awesome gear!,2021,03
Bought this for gaming and I love them,2021,03
"The headset goes hard, it was on the more budget end but feels sturdy and came with an excellent chord/adapters. The sound quality is good and the mic pickup fairs well. This product is an excellent choice.",2021,03
Great headset and I like using it! Fits comfortably and has good sound quality!,2021,03
"Bought for my 8 yr old grandson. He loves the color combo. Told me they fit perfectly and the sound was ""awesome"". Highly recommend.",2021,03
It's a very comfortable headset that I can play with for hours without feeling uncomfortable. It's very light and the cable is long which I really value a lot. The LED lights are a nice touch when playing at nighttime or just wanna show off.  I really enjoy the solid quality.,2021,03
There is nothing wrong it’s amazing,2021,03
My kids use for Xbox and talk to their friends.  Noise canceling for sure as they can’t hear me when I call them up for dinner or tell them to turn off the game and go to bed. Great value.,2021,03
"Got this for my son for Christmas, he loves it for his Xbox.",2021,03
Everything,2021,03
"Lights only work if USB cord is connected. Therefore, it can be used with the computer but lights won't work with XBOX.  Noice cancellation doesn't work well at all but my son is happy with them overall.",2021,03
My son loves these headphones,2021,03
"Once you configure this as your default it is simply fantastic. Sound is crisp and clear and the microphone is equally as good. I use it for gaming and online studying. The noise deadening eliminates distractions, which is very helpful.",2021,03
"Nice headset, loud quality sound and great for noise cancelling.",2021,03
Boyfriend LOVED them. And couldn’t come close to hearing me with the noise cancellation!! LOL,2021,03
The only time u cant hear anything is when u have it on full volume,2021,03
Very nice color and it’s shiny too!!,2021,03
Honestly I feel really scammed. I plugged in these headphones into my PS4 and the sound quality WAS AWFUL. I could only hear out of one side of the headphone and that was the microphone side. Honestly should not have been cheap on gaming headphones and paid for more expensive and high quality gaming accessories,2021,03
"The sound quality is great.  Mic tested fine.The quality of the materials seems a bit cheap though.  The cushion for the top of the head, was a bit minimal.  The ear muffs, were a bit small, and did not really provide sufficient room for your ears to be comfortably inside them.  My ears were aching/hurting within 2 hours of wearing the headphones.If you're a kid, these will probably work out great for you.  An adult?  pass 'em up.",2021,03
I love how this particular headset is designed because it is designed for everyone and fits everyone. It is super comforatable and easy to transport. It was a really nice durable cord as well. I highly recommend this to anyone that would like to have a nice comforatable headset!,2021,03
"My daughter seems to be happy with it. It must cancel noise because she can’t hear me when I’m talking to her, now I just need some noise canceling headphones while she’s gaming. Lol",2021,03
The microphone stopped working after owning the headphones less than a week.,2021,03
"Great product, purchased for my child to use for gaming",2021,03
All around the product is bad. I bought it as a Christmas gift and the user can not speak to other people. He can hear them fine. The mic is turned on the settings on the console allow for chatting and he even reset the console to factory default. Beware of the cheap price tag as this is a cheap product.,2021,03
Headphones are fantastic.  Still working on getting the microphone configured on my son's computer.,2021,03
There was very good audio quality.,2021,03
"These made my grandson so happy....RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!!! He loves the feel, color and thinks they are the coolest ever!! I love when I can make my grand babies happy",2021,03
My son recently was gifted this headset for birthday he loves it. An it fits his head perfectly. He says he can hear is friends good an they can also hear him well. I highly recommend this headset.,2021,03
Wired good sound,2021,03
"These worked day one and now only work once in a while. Using our 7-year-old to play his PlayStation 4, he can only get them to connect and work 25 percent of the time. We finally gave up and ordered another set from elsewhere locally. These headphones look good but are very unreliable and do not work all the time. The instructions are terrible and do not explain troubleshooting. I would stay away from them personally if I know the light on them is what attracted him to them in the first place. Sometimes things look better than they are, and this is one of them.",2021,03
"I really liked this headset, the mic is working really great and it feels really comfortable.",2021,03
This is just what my son wanted! The ears phones light up but I can’t get over how much noise is canceled! This is a great value. My son isn’t a gamer but uses this for e-learning in school! Great find!,2021,03
Liked the light up. The noise cancelling could've been better.,2021,03
This headset truly surprised me! It is awesome for warzone and other battle royal games!,2021,03
"My son needed decent headphones with a microphone for virtual distance learning for school, he enjoys these, they work, they are comfortable for his hours of meetings.  He likes the fact that they light up; overall I'd buy again.",2021,03
It's extremely comfortable and you can hear everything..,2021,03
I got a pair for my sons birthday and he really loves them.,2021,03
They lasted 3 months and then the microphone broke.,2021,03
Update: I received my free headset for leaving a comment and review and Its awesome would definitely recommend doing so if you want a free headset. It looks good and easy to use no complications and comes with adapter for PC. I really like them so far. Only down fall is when using for PlayStation or any aux plug the headset does not light up. Only lights when using usb.,2021,03
Great head set,2021,03
Great sound quality for the price and the mic works well too! definitely an improvement from normal earbuds.,2021,03
I liked the she sound quality and how comfortable the headset overall feels.,2021,03
These are very good for the low price tag. My son loves them!,2021,03
Just received it. Works great. Good sound. Blocks a lot of background noise making gaming a lot easier.,2021,03
Shipping was fast.  Have not used the product for very long yet so I will update this review when I have had it for a while.,2021,03
Works perfectly for what I needed.,2021,03

I love the noise cancellation and quality of the head phones. 10/10,2021,03
This is not compatible with the first generation Xbox one,2021,03
It’s very good,2021,03
Son loves it. He's very happy,2021,03
Amazing sound quality,2021,03
"I love how noise cancelling they are, it came with a free audio jack which was a delighful surprise, my friends say they can hear me a lot clearer now, overall very pleased",2021,03
"Excellent quality, great sound and lightweight",2021,03
Nice headset blue lights are a cool addition. The headset is comfortable and works great. Well worth the price.,2021,02
"I expected the earmuffs to actually fit over my ears but these are too small and just sit on top of my ear pressing then down which with long gaming sessions causes a fair amount of pain an discomfort.Edit: Today, May 22, the seller BENGOO contacted me directly and offered me $30 as an incentive to remove my negative review, which is a violation of amazons sellers policies.",2021,03
These headphones work fantastically. My son uses them for online school and the teacher was having a hard time hearing him with all the noise in the background. Now with these headphones they bother can hear each other no problem.,2021,03
Been through a few inexpensive headsets for son's gaming.  These performed better than the others.,2021,03
I really liked them they have very good sound quality,2021,03
"Great for gaming. Awesome sound. Lights only work when plugged into a USB, so don't buy these if you're excited about the lights.",2021,03
Good sound,2021,03
Product came In as promised and it worked perfect! Can't wait for my pc to come in and try these bad boys out!,2021,03
Bought this for my teenage son to use for his PS4 gaming. He has used Sony Gold headsets and Turtle Beach higher end sets and says these are an very good.  For the price they seem to be an excellent value.  This is being rated 5 stars not that they are as good or better than the others mentioned but for the value vs. quality of sound.  Hopefully they will last a decent while to truly earn the 5 star rating.  Gave it 5 stars but if they don’t last for at least 6 months that will be revised.,2021,03
Ours never worked. Should have returned. Went straight to the trash.,2021,03
Very clean look. Would recommend again!,2021,03
"My son love it, good quality",2021,03
"Use it everyday. Has been a life saver, It's honestly the best headset from the price. Especially if you're a gamer.10/10 Quality, Sound, Price, Durability100% Recommend",2021,03
"Comfortable, sound clear and looks nice",2021,03
My daughter uses these for ps4 gaming! Loves loves& sour GREAT 👍,2021,03
Works well and really pretty,2021,03
"The mic broke off within a year, and they replaced the headphones without hesitation. They were interested in how they could improve their product! Would definitely purchase again without worry as they stand by their products.",2021,03
"This is our second purchase, my son likes it alot, the first one the mic went out due to he kept putting it in his mouth.  Great headset for the money!",2021,03
Decent material for cushioning. Not too heavy even for younger users. All in all a good headset for the price.,2021,03
Good quality,2021,03
Received the headphones and they were very comfortable and the sound quality was top notch.,2021,03
"Good value for what you pay. They're comfortable, the lights aren't too bright, and the sound is decent.",2021,03
This is a really well made pair of headphones. The cord is very long which is the best part and it makes it even better because I need a long cord because my desktop is real far under my desk.,2021,03
It's solid and well built and functions well. The only issue is the short cord for the lights.,2021,03
"Super comfortable on ears, great for long time use.",2021,03
I ordered one back in October ish? and it just gave out on me sound wise. I was using it in a discord call and it randomly stopped transporting the sound so I ordered a new one. It is a good headset just upset it gave out so quickly :/,2021,03
It ear muff are soft the sound it really good,2021,03
I brought his product for my son he enjoys  It does provide a lot of isolation hearing when  He's very engaged..,2021,03
"QUALITY IS GREAT nothing bad, It fits perfect, sounds perfect.",2021,03
"I’ve only had the headset for 4 months and already  I’m getting static when trying to talk to my friends on Xbox. Also, not sure who to contact to see about a replacement. The headset sat on a mount out of the way and wasn’t impacted by anything g out of the ordinary.",2021,03
"Last about 4 weeks, then started loosing mic, uninstalled audio reinstalled and worked for week now its hit or miss. Screw chinese knck offs. Spend another 10 for American made.",2021,03
Grandson loved it,2021,03
Bought and love that they cancel out noise as well as the sound quality is great. Don't love that you have to plug in the USB wire so they light up.,2021,03
I bought this for my son's birthday and he absolutely loves them! Would definitely buy again!,2021,03
"For a cheaoer headset, works great!",2021,03
For the price they are great but could be slightly better. Before these I had some 70$ over priced turtle beach ones. They were slightly better than these in terms of sound quality. But I'd buy these again for the price,2021,03
Great for gaming!,2021,03
Honestly all the hate for this headset is uncalled for. This headset has all you need at such a good price. Fits perfectly and has a long cord and the sound quality is amazing. I wouldn’t be where I’m at gaming wise if it weren’t for these headsets allowing me to hear almost everything on the maps,2021,03
Works great,2021,03
"The reason why this product has good reviews is because the seller told buyers to vote them many stars and they will get the gift as a commission. However, they just scam buyers.",2021,03
I liked how conveniently priced it was for a good quality headset. I use it for gaming and streaming.,2021,03
"I liked this headset originally. Very comfortable, the sound was good, everyone could hear and understand me. Then, the audio got really choppy. Not a great long-term investment if you want to use the mic!",2021,03
I like how the headset feels comfortable. Usually after a hour of game play my ears start to hurt. Not with the new ones! I highly recommend. I would like to add the great customer service too.,2021,03
"Good sound quality for price, ear cup a little small.",2021,03
I loved it the sound quality was amazing and clear while my friends said the my mic was very clear.,2021,03
"The BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset has an outstanding mic and the noise cancellation helps a lot. I've just got it today and I tested it out, the sound is amazing and the microphone is outstanding as well. I had many of my friends confirm the sound of my microphone and the LED lights make it look cooler! Really recommended.",2021,03
Not very good quality,2021,03
these headphones are amazing i use them to record my videos.,2021,03
perfect,2021,03
"You get what you pay for, works some days and doesn’t on others.",2021,03
Well worth the price!,2021,03
They are a little bass heavy. Having an adjustment knob would be nice. Good quality though.,2021,03
Very good noise cancelation for the price.,2021,03
Good headset for gaming I love how the provide the splitter for audio in and audio out jacks on your pc so you don’t have to buy one. For being way cheaper than the rest I would say it’s great quality.,2021,03

Good headset would bye again,2021,03
Very comfortable. I like the noise cancelling feature.,2021,03

Good headphones,2021,03
I use theses for gaming and they’re great!,2021,03
It is a lot better than my other pair I'm glad I bought these.,2021,03
"USB connection is weird for ps4, doesn't work for anything but charging. Comfortable ear piece, and good price, but sound quality on highest setting is mediocre at best. Decent treble and bass levels too, but output is garbage.",2021,03
 Good quality for the price recommended  it to anyone looking for a good deal,2021,03
"For the Price, it has excellent noise cancellation.The audio quality is Good!And the overall comfort of the headset is appreciated, It adjusts, and doesn't bother me or my glasses.",2021,03

love it!,2021,03
"Just got this, and let’s see if it’s worth it, wil come back to leave the after use review",2021,03
" I bought this as a replacement headset for my work at home job and the sound quality coming in is nice, but the sound quality going out is super muffled.The ear muffs are also on the smaller side, but that just means I have larger than average ears lol",2021,03
"These are a very good quality set for the sub $30. The only thing that could be better is the max volume could be higher, but they are still very good. Other than that I am very pleased and would purchase this product again in the future.",2021,03
Amazing product the noise cancelling is very impressive,2021,03
Good,2021,03
"Perfect for gaming,  fits my 7 year old perfect.",2021,03
My son has requested this headset and loves that he can control the volume on the cord control.  The sound quality is really good too he has told me.,2021,03
It’s perfect for everything.They fit on my ear without me noticing they are even their sometimes. The Sound and material quality is excellent and would definitely buy another one of these headphones again!. Thank you BENGOO. The sound quality and noise cancellation is true.,2021,03
Great quality for the price,2021,03
There not the best but if your paying this amount of money I’d say they are great 10/10 definitely worth it,2021,03

"Works great, my son really likes it.",2021,02
They included the pc adapter which was really nice.,2021,02
Its great except the cord is way too long. There should be no reason why its as long as it is and I've tripped on it a couple of times (I'm 6 foot tall) and it's gotten caught under the wheels of my gaming chair. Other than that it works fine.,2021,02
"Works well. I wish that the ear pieces were a bit more comfortable. Sound quality very good. Mic seems to be good, but windows settings keep changing...I don't think it is in the headset's fault.",2021,02

Shoutout Bengoooooooooo,2021,02
"My son really likes this headset and it worked well for the first 2 months. I bought it for him for Christmas and it no longer works properly (by the end of Feb).  Unfortunately, he can no longer talk with his friends while playing because the mouthpiece quit working.  He can still hear everything, but they can't hear him.",2021,02

"I've been on the hunt for a gaming headset for a while now and stumbled across these. What really caught my eye first was the price of these, ($25?? can't beat that!), and secondly the LED effect sold me.I tried these out and think they have great noise cancellation and I love that you can adjust the volume of it and it also comes with multiple cords to connect with many different devices.",2021,02
"Good product but after wearing for a period of time, it begins to stretch out and loosen on the ears. I wrap them tight when storing to reset them.",2021,02
"The sound quality is amazing. Not to mention the great design, all around a good headset.",2021,02
"I was surprised at the quality of the headset.  The sound coming from the as well as the microphone are good quality. I wouldn't say they are noise cancelling as I could still hear people talking that are sitting next to me, but these were not purchased for noise cancelling.  The sound is very good and they are comfortable.  I didn't think they were that heavy for their size.",2021,02
good headset,2021,02
niceee,2021,02
I love the look and the lights are super cool  and the sound is very nice love it,2021,02
"It's a really nice headset, was a bit disappointed when I found that the usb was only for the lights and that you needed the splitter for the pc. Sadly, my laptop only has one jack, so I had to order another splitter just to use the new headset. I may have missed the description about all of that, so it could be my fault. It would have been nice though if the usb worked for both the lights and the headset.",2021,02
Not made for PS4!!!!  First off you need to plug in the USB connection into a separate power source to get the lights to work. The sound jack that plugs in to your PS4 controller is split with the USB but both cords are very short.  So you have to choose to play with the lights off if you want to use it with the PS4 controller comfortably.  If thats the case then whats the point of owning it?  This is made more for laptops than PS4.  I dont recommend if you are thinking of buying it for the PS4.,2021,02
"Love the headset, nice sound, great noise cancellation and soft on the ears",2021,02
Solid headset for the price,2021,02
Product came as described. 12 year old son says it works great. Purchased for gaming and solid sound quality.,2021,02
Was a gift. Very happy with it.,2021,02
These are great for gaming.  Love the way it feels on my head and great sound quality,2021,02
One of the best gaming headsets I’ve come across so far. I’ve already tested 3 other models from this brand.,2021,02
Will buy again if needed. Also a perfect gift for any gamers.,2021,02
Decent headset for the price for a new gamer.  Kinda big for a childs head.  But will do,2021,02
"When my old headset stopped working as well, I needed to quickly get a replacement so I could continue streaming and making content. This did the job well enough.",2021,02
This item is perfect for my husbands warzone game! We love the mute option as well!,2021,02
Headphones are comfortable,2021,02
Love the weight to them. Perfect for my head.,2021,02
" This is just below better than the 40 I spent on another headset. I do t use the lights, but I enjoy the option mute button and control volume. Cancels out like 70-80 surrounding noises , which I also enjoy because I don't like to be completely clueless to my surroundings . Comfy headset, compared to the universal elastic ones other designs have",2021,02
"These are perfect. The quality and durability its beyond perfect. I thought because it was low priced that it would break simply, but it didnt. It fits perfectly and doesn’t irritate my ears 10/10",2021,02
"What you can expect for the price point. The audio quality itself is good, but the mic is very quiet. Also, the LED only works with the USB plugged in, which is a downside.",2021,02
"I am going to use this product to record Youtube videos! Amazing headset! Comfy, pretty much noice cancelling, nice sound quality, and a decent mic!",2021,02
"When I initially got my package the box was open on both sides but thankfully the headphones weren’t damaged.  The headphones work great so far and aside from the packaging, I don’t have anything negative to say about the product.",2021,02
It stopped working after 30 days light don’t work unless you plug it in to a USB adapter very useless,2021,02
"I use this for PC, gaming, and listening to music on my phone, yes I'm a little old school lol. The color is great and the design is very appealing to a gamer like me. You'll like these :)",2021,02
It allows you to hear outside noise if there's no audio coming through but with audio coming through it drowns out other noise. Very Comfortable.,2021,02
We purchased these for gaming and they work just fine.  My son has not complained that they are uncomfortable and wears them for long stretches of time.  Would buy again.,2021,02
Best headphones I've played with,2021,02
"the mic was not bendable and stopped working after a week, the sound quality was ok though",2021,02
This headphones exhibit great quality sound and mic clarity. The cushions on the headphones make them comfortable enough to wear for several hours. They are well-designed and highly ergonomic. The headphones also do a great job of cancelling background noise.,2021,02
for gaming,2021,02
This was such a great deal that I could not pass up! The noises in the house have gone down from screaming to a soft chatter in the background.  Such a pleasant surprise and what a wonderful gift this has brought to my entire family!,2021,02
What I didn't like is that the cord was too long but overall when I am gaming the mike and sound quality are pretty good. And don't get me started on the great price!,2021,02
Exactly what needed and was looking for in a game game set. Sound quality is amazing and easy to use.,2021,02
Did not light up or do what it said,2021,02
Very good headset. The surround sound is really nice and they are great at noise cancellation,2021,02
I'm really enjoying the quality of sound. I also find them comfortable.,2021,02
Amazing headset would recommend,2021,02
I love these. They are great gaming headphones  and amazing in general for gaming. They are very handy.,2021,02
"I have to push a button to mute mic. My last headphones I could just move mic to mute. However, overall for the price they are good.",2021,02
Great comfort and fit!,2021,02
"These headphones were comfortable, had great quality sound, and was convenient. What I didn't like however is that you CANNOT change the cable on the headset. After a couple of months the wire that connects to the audio jack was so weak it stops working. I would keep using these headphones if it wasn't for the fact that you cannot ever change the cable if it gets damaged.",2021,02
Fast shipping and good quality,2021,02
"The mic is easy to use and have good mic quality. My friends say that they don't hear any static or background noises. The earpad are very comfortable on my ears though, so if you have sensitive ears the headphones wont be an issues. The sound is good quality which is need for games like apex and cod.. In conclusion good headphones for the price and I will definitely buy again in the future.",2021,02
It pretty much works like it said it would wish the ears were a little bit more comfortable better than that 100%,2021,02
It is amazing it sounds great,2021,02
"For the price, it's way better than more expensive ones.",2021,02
Very comfortable and the 3d sound quality is amazing!,2021,02
"the price for the item is good, but sound quality is bad, disappointed, expected better sound quality.",2021,02
Good sound quality for beginners,2021,02
Good quality for a good price!,2021,02
Awesome,2021,02
These are well made and amazing for the price point. Absolutely recommend.,2021,02
My son loves the headset.  We've ordered several before but this headset has the right hookup for Xbox One.  Great sound quality too.,2021,02
Really like these,2021,02
Very good,2021,02
My son loves it,2021,02
One of the better headsets out there for a good price.,2021,02
Very bad advertising. In the process of sending this back as it doesn’t work with XBox one.,2021,02
Product came in perfect condition and feels amazing. Very comfortable on the head and the sound quality is perfect :). The cord it self its very durable too. As of right now I have had no issies with it!,2021,02
It didn't fit the controller,2021,02
Great for distance learning,2021,02
"I like the headphones, unfortunately the wire was too short for the lights to be plugged in to the USB port and the controller on my PS4, the USB plugin for the lights was about 4"" long and the rest of the cord was longer, but the sound was great I do have to keep one side off my ear because I  need to be able to hear other things in the house, definitely comfortable.",2021,02
Love everything about it,2021,02
i bought this for my son but my husband liked them so much we got him a pair to. he likes them more them the $300 gaming headset he has. he also likes how easy he can go from console to PC with the included adapter.,2021,02
So far great! I love the look and the sound is A1! Definitely recommend!,2021,02
Great colors and sound,2021,02
These headphones replaced another pair that just didn't last.  These are working great and appear very durable and stylish.  My son loves them!,2021,02
"These are the best headphones I've ever purchased! The sound quality is smooth and amazing, and any noise that is around you is completely cancelled out. I couldn't be happier with this product, and I highly recommend it!",2021,02
"I went through 3 headphones before finding these and I love them. And at this price, it's a steal. I had HpyerX, JBL, and RUNMUS. THese are the best. The hyper X headset was nice but also twice the cost and the speakers on these are just as good.",2021,02
Good pick up,2021,02
It’s really good in my opinion. I use it to play rust a lot and it’s great.,2021,02
"Decided to upgrade to this one after having my headset for 8 years, worth it.",2021,02
one of the best things you can buy for $100,2022,11
"Great all around speaker, I've use it for quite some time now and still love it. Great sound, durable, and connects easily",2022,11
"This item is compact, beautiful and sounds freaking great!!!! BUY ONE NOW!!!! (I have one in the house and this one in my office!!)",2022,11
its strong clear and great,2022,11
Very loud an steady great bass an it's the sizes of an football but I like it,2022,11
"I bought the Charge 4 a year after I got the Charge 3. I loved the thumpin' bass on the charge3 and decided to pair it with another JBL product and decided to go with the upgrade so I got the Charge4. I set it up to the right and left of my work area. The whole set up sounded awesome with sound coming from both left and right speaker sources. As awesome as it was, though--it was NOT stereo - just two identical sounds coming from different sources- can't hear the sound engineer's instrumental separations during the recording (as with headphones) but like I said- produced some pretty good results for the price.",2022,11
great deal for the price and sounds amazing,2022,11
Compact with great sound.,2022,11
My three cents:Just the JBL Charge 4 and the portable speaker bass and sound quality are great for the price.  You can charge it while using it so it doesn't need to be portable.,2022,10
"The Charge 4 has beautiful sound, and is very easy to set up and operate. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for a small portable speaker with great sound.",2022,10
Fast shipping. Great price. Awesome new high quality Bluetooth speaker at a great discount,2022,10
I purchased this item for my office so I could play some background music while I work. I work better with some low background music. The speaker is GREAT! The ONLY issue I’ve had is the speaker took forever to charge and after a while the battery wouldn’t charge all the way. I read online that if you have this problem you need to try using a different charging cord and charging plug. So I bought a new charging plug and cord. IT WORKED and now the speaker charges just fine. The charging cord that comes with the speaker may not be “strong” enough and you may need another charging cord and plug.,2022,10
"My daughter has one of these and when I heard it I was blown away. Awesome sound with deep bass. It sounds best up to about 70% of volume, but even that is more than plenty of volume. The battery is awesome lasting several days and you can charge your phone or iPad without reducing a lot of battery life.",2022,10
"I was very excited to get this speaker as I've always like JBL products.  However, even though battery life was great, I was underwhelmed by the sound. Kind of muffled. Needless to say I was very disappointed and returned it.",2022,10
"Love how easy it connects and the Sound!! It’s superb! Don’t think just get it, I may get more!",2022,10
You don’t need the charge 5 this thing is awesome and much cheaper. Wait till charge 5 is on sale,2022,10
"The main we reason we bought the JBL 4 to begin with was because it has the jack that you could use for an Ipod. (I know, old school).  My husband had spent years downloading all of his favorite songs on his Ipod and wanted to be able to listen to his playlist through a quality speaker. Once we received the speaker, we were super impressed with the sound quality. The bluetooth range is good too. We liked the quality so much that we have three of them! We keep one at home for pool parties and get togethers and we have two at our cabin.",2022,10
The sound that comes out of this thing is incredible!  We use it indoors and outdoors. Never had an issue and I would def buy again!,2022,10
"meme I love the sound, it's impeccable, its low tones are fabulous, you can feel the music, I always take it to the beach although I've never submerged it! I don't know if it can withstand salt water! excellent investment!",2022,10
I gave this to my dad for father’s day and he loved it !,2022,10
The product is good but very pricey. I have seen similar products for less.,2022,10
"great sound so I bought 4, thanks",2022,10
I have 2 of these speakers for my ebike they sound good and they are durable I've dropped mine several times and even in the rain they still work beautifully no BS!! Thx.,2022,10
"From the several bluetooth speakers I've owned for nearly 10 years, this significantly has the clearest and best quality sound of them all. I notice that percussion is distinctively clearer from any bluetooth speaker I've heard as well. JBL always delivers a top notch durable product.",2022,10
I do lots of sidejobs and needed something loud and clear for long hard hours and this blew my expectations.it's small.loud and crisp clear.i love me some j.b.l!!,2022,10
I got the speaker and love it but won’t work with the JBL app so I can’t get the bass up,2022,10
I love this speaker. It’s a very loud speaker if you have a small place your living in the sound can be heard through out the whole house. The battery sometimes die fast but I just keep it on the charger.,2022,10
Is everything I had hoped for and more.,2022,10
Could not have been wrong in ordering this speaker,2022,10
Works every time and have used it in the rain.,2022,10
I loved this product it was a gift one of the best how can you ask for anything  better the Quality is awesome the sound is fantastic it's easy to use and understand the manual I found the light colored devices get dirty quickly that's the sucky part no case to keep it clean while it's being used.  The Bluetooth compatibility is also a keeper getting awesome range as well just for reference the charging port tents to get lose multiple of my friends say the same thing but no worries you won't regret it trust me.,2022,10
I like you the place is good it sounds good and your quality of your merchandise it's good,2022,10
 The item i buy is broken look at this,2022,10
Easy to carry.,2022,10
"Didn’t work, no way to charge it",2022,10
"Omg! Where do I start? I LOVE LOVE LOVE this speaker… I use mine all the time as I hook up my Spotify playlist to this kickin’ speaker and blast the tunes around my house. The sound is perfect! The shape is perfect. Using it is a breeze! AND transports easily into the shower! Yes,waterproof too!! Did I mention I LOVE THIS SPEAKER?!?❤️❤️❤️😂",2022,10
Because I can't purchase an expensive one I purchase the JBL Charger. I don't regret it.Love everything about it.,2022,10
"You cannot turn the speaker off without it, making a loud noise. They know it’s annoying. It’s meant to get you to install the app. If you install the app, giving up more of yourself to them in other words, they let you turn it off. I think it’s meant to be annoying because even if you turn the volume down to 0, and cannot hear anything else, it will still make a loud noise when turning off.They want you to not be able to turn it off quietly, for example, when you were listening to some thing in bed and forgot to turn it off and later on, want to turn it off quietly.Works fine otherwise.The one star is just cause I think it’s fair to penalize such behavior.",2022,10
"Sounds like a gigantic speaker.  My daughter had one of these from Amazon and I loved it on her coffee table to use with TV across the room, so I bought it and was impressed when listening to my Amazon downloaded music.  Hubby heard it and bought himself the next version up to enhance his ipad music.  Amazing sound from a small unit.  We've use it in the garage to practice our dance steps and the quality is excellent.",2022,10
Stopped working after a year. It won't charge smh,2022,10
"I honestly listen to this little speaker about everyday for the last 2 years. I especially love it by the pool. It's holding up great, the battery runs for at least 3 hours, maybe more. For the money, it's a great deal.",2022,10
"At noise levels befitting age subdued rock and rollers, this speaker performs admirably.",2022,10
"This unit works perfectly for what I needed. I can bluetooth music over the air, or wire into the aux to mix music in a DAW, in real time, without bluetooth latency. I went for the Charge 4 specifically for the aux; so far, no issues. Recorded a track today with a 25 key midi keyboard and the headphone out of my computer to the Charge 4; works like a charm!",2022,10
Love the Bluetooth Speaker. I purchased 1 nearly 3 years ago and since purchased 2 more and given them as gifts.,2022,10
"Great sound, very portable, looks great and sounds great.",2022,10
Own a charge 3 already. Based on reviews bought the charge 4. First thing I noticed is the 3 has better sound as in bass. The 4 is slightly larger and definitely goes louder. You can link two or more 4s together but 4 doesn’t link to 3. Dig this speaker,2022,10
"works great, Can't think of anything negative to say!!",2022,10
Fast delivery and great quality,2022,10
Had an older JBL portable speaker. The charge is way more expensive and larger than my old one but not any louder. Was disappointed in that.,2022,10
Bought this to teach dance at various places. Works well in big and small spaces. Sound even carries well outside. Easy to carry in its box which is beautiful. Love JBL.,2022,10
"Great sound, very clear. Love to take it outside while gardening. It’s lightweight and charged quickly.",2022,10
Home,2022,10
"Compact size, big sound!",2022,10
Awesome sound. Excellent battery life.,2022,10
"I have bought a couple of these speakers, they sound great, u can use the app  to use multiple speaker",2022,09
I love this speaker! My dad has one and uses it outside while barbecuing and I love the sound quality. I had to get my own and so far it has not disappointed.,2022,09
I recently had it dunged below water for at least 24 hours with ill effects so far,2022,09
love this speaker and its waterproof.,2022,09
Disregard any negative comments.  This is a great piece of gear.,2022,09
Better than my Mercedes Benz speaker.easy to carry to open house.,2022,09
Worked well on our camping trip,2022,09
Durable battery life . I took it to my camp trip and literally played music all day with out having to charge it,2022,09
Sound quality and battery life are amazing. I love connecting with other JBL products for better surround sound quality,2022,09
Broken from box,2022,09
Thought it was gonna boom. Nice sound but just not very loud. Haven’t charged it in like 2 months tho so that’s lit,2022,09
This is the second we have. One in the garage and this one in the gym. Easy to pair and use and great battery,2022,09
"Intended to pair this charge 4 with flip 4 in JBL app to create stereo pair.  It can’t do it, JBL app won’t allow it, both speakers must be identical.  I sent it back.",2022,09
I had bought my husband a smaller version of this speaker for my husband and we both loved it.  I decided I wanted one of my own and ordered this version.  Oh my goodness the sound is amazing.  The charge on the battery lasts a good long time- I use it almost every day!!!  You won't be sorry with this product!,2022,09
Enjoy this wherever I go. Not real good at charging though.,2022,09
"Actually one helluva speaker. not too loud, but I don't want to lose my ears, so I like it.",2022,09
Not very loud sound is ok,2022,09
"I was debating between the JBL charge 4 and a different version of the JBL and I’m so glad I went with this one! The sounds quality is amazing and it came packaged so nicely. JBL speakers on Amazon go on sale frequently so add it to your cart and wait for the price to drop! The quality is amazing and it’s so load for how small it is. This one doesn’t come with a case or carrier or anything but it is made out of such nice quality I haven’t had any issues or scratches and I’ve just been throwing it in a tote bag! The charging port for your phone is so nice too, and chargers relatively fast. If you’re debating between this one and a pricier one I would go with the Charge 4!",2022,09
This system will not disappoint.  All of our family members own one and love it!,2022,09
Works perfectly.,2022,09
So far ok needs a Bluetooth up grade,2022,09
Worked great for a few months but now sounds like a blown speaker in a car. Should have bought the protecting plan but it's JBL so figured wouldn't need it. My ION speakers lasted longer in rougher conditions.,2022,09
Sounds great for it’s size and connects with no problem. Durable and has good battery life.,2022,09
I love that this model still has the aux port with all the great things of the newer models.,2022,09
Not impressed..Just not loud as expected Tribit Max is less expensive with much more Huge clear sound compared to this!,2022,09
For listening to music,2022,09
Sounds so good and gets very loud. Bluetooth connects to both my iphone and my boyfriends android easily every time! the battery life is amazing as well! Worth the money.,2022,09
Great product,2022,09
My last charge 4 was lost/stolen. I had no hesitation buying another. Just a great speaker for most occasions!,2022,09
"Absolutely love everything about this speaker!! The battery life is insanely long! If you’re debating between this speaker and another one, get this one!! You won’t be disappointed!",2022,09
"Overall this is a great speaker. It’s clear, loud, and pretty user friendly. The battery seems to be pretty good at 70% volume or less, but close to the top of the volume range, it really lacks in battery life. When I have it at 100% charge, and 100% volume, it will barely last me getting ready in the morning. (Probably takes me 20-30 minutes)",2022,09
I honestly liked everything overall. Sitting in my room listening to music I thought it was super loud and loved it. Then when I went outside you could barely hear it from a short distance.,2022,09
The sound quality far exceeds the price of the speaker. Battery life is exceptional and the bluetooth connectivity could not be easier.  I highly recommend this speaker.,2022,09
Sounds sooooo good!!!,2022,09
Sounds quality is amazing battery last very long and the overall built quality is just good never ever reviewed something and gave it five star but this one absolutely deserves it.,2022,09
"Sound is great, very loud. I love it",2022,09
Love the speaker. Sound quality is good. However we have had the hardest time. The speaker willPower off and then somehow power itself back on. It randomly turns on and you randomly connect to it. Tried customer service but couldn’t get anyone on the phone who could hear me clearly or understand English. I now have a speaker I have to keep plugged in and disconnect and turn off blue tooth or it just automatically connects.,2022,09
Battery life is pretty good sounds OK,2022,09
"I have a weird situation with my speaker, everything works fine except that it doesnt allow me to turn it Off, whenever you try to turn it off, it goes off for some 4-5 sec and turns ON by itself. I have try several troubleshooting steps and still the same.",2022,09
Flip4 to me seems almost as loud and sound quality as good so sent it back and kept the flip4.,2022,09
"I absolutely love this little speaker, for its size it is truly incredible and it has been very durable! The ability to connect multiple together is very useful. I connected to of them and not of the larger speakers together and used them as the sound system for my outdoor wedding. Worked great!",2022,09
"I got this on sale, and it was so worth it! Great buy!",2022,09
It could me louder but it works and sounds great volume is not that big of a deal,2022,09
"It's an adequate speaker for this price point.  I'll cover the points addressed in other reviews but the short version is the speaker is fine.  I do not feel like I wasted money, but if/when I buy another of these types of speakers it won't be a JBL.  It's been at least 3 years since I've bought one of these BT speakers and my last speaker was just as loud/clear, cost less, had features that just worked, and even came with a lanyard for easy carry.  This thing would be hard to carry for someone with small hands.-Volume and Sound Quality:  It's loud in a room with no ambient noise. My music is mostly 90's rock like Metallica, Pantera, White Zombie.  I like loud music and for my private office it's perfect.I'll mostly listen at 1/3 volume so I can think, but it's nice to jam out sometimes. At middle volume level the sound is the best (lows vs highs) above half volume the bass tapers off and mostly just the highs are increased volume wise.  You could use this in an environment with ambient noise, like a warehouse or kitchen, but you would need to stay around 5' if you want to really enjoy what is playing.  After 10' it's probably going to sound more like noise than music.-Phone Connectivity is simple for music just push a top button, but not automatic for phone calls like it was with my other speaker I had in the price point.  There are some reviews that cover troubleshooting this, the manual certainly is no help, but it's not what I needed it for.  I just liked it as a nice side feature I used sometimes with my last speaker like this.-Battery Life is fine, I haven't done complete testing on this.  It does have a pretty significant battery in it for the ""charge your device"" option, but 20 hrs?  Maybe at the lowest volume playing nice simple music.  I won't need it for longer than 4hrs most of the time, so I doubt this will come up as an issue for me.-There's an app but it does very little for this speaker.  Most ""useful"" feature is a digital copy of the horrible instructions that come with the speaker.  Thankfully for it's main function of BT Connecting and playing music it's pretty basic and simple.  If you go the route of multiple speakers, reads the reviews for the app on how to make that work.  It is not intuitive, it's a series of linear steps which the instructions do not help with, and if you do it wrong all kinds of weird issues were reported in the reviews.",2022,09
"As a previous Jambox owner, I purchased this because I was told there would be good bass, sound clarity, and volume; I love playing loud music when showering. Unfortunately, this wasn’t it. I wish I could return because it’s not given what was sold.",2022,09
"so far i like it, it has great sound quality.",2022,09
"Not at all impressed with the sound quality. For the price, I expected much better.Update:  After 2 months of use I'm downgrading to 1 star. $200 for mediocre sound quality and no bass is completely unacceptable. No chance I'm buying JBL again.",2022,09
I use this product every day since it arrived to my house lol. When I come home from work I use it for podcasts and music. I definitely listen to it when I am ready for bed. 😁,2022,09
Really love this! Very good product! Buy one or two!,2022,09
The speed at which it turns on and connects to your device is unmatched for me. The battery life is just amazing. I have it playing for 7 hours sometimes and it doesn’t even lose half the battery. I’ve taken it out on the water and it’s gotten wet with no issues. Just an absolutely amazing speaker.,2022,09
Great base sound. Gets really loud and projects well. I play daily almost most of the day and battery last almost 6 days before having to change,2022,09
Well I thought the product was great but I expected it to be louder which it wasn’t. Don’t get me wrong it is pretty loud but I just expected it to be more. To the reviews I’ve seen they made it seem like you would physically have to lower the volume or else you would go deaf but I don’t know.,2022,09
Got Anker motion boom instead of this JBL for the same money.,2022,09
my brother gave to his wife. loves the sound and size,2022,09
Wonderful sound with low full bass and the battery lasts forever. Lights indicate when it gets low. Bluetooth connection strong snd not glitchy. Would be nice if it had microphone to use for calls but not needed.,2022,09
Bought as a gift for my grandson to take to college. He loves it!,2022,09
"This is my second JBL speaker and the first one lasted me almost 5 years with no issues. So far this one works pretty well, and has good sound quality. Every once and a while the BT won’t automatically connect and I have to manually do it. The battery life is good. I usually listen to music as I get ready for work in the mornings and it lasts three weeks doing that before it needs a recharge.",2022,09
"I had this model on hold for a long while as I searched for the best all around speaker for my 14 year old sons bday. This thing is awesome! Sound is crisp and clear. And no vibration or sound distortion at the highest level. From Rap to Reggaton this speaker is awesome. JBL is an old U.S. brand and still putting out a great product. Even the color design is solid without peeling. I have two more on my list for Christmas for my other son and my husband. I definitely recommend buying the case. This does come with a USB ""C"" type cord but no charging block to plug into the wall. This is also a charger and has an On/Off button. Volume is controlled by Bluetooth on smart phone. Instant change between songs without skipping or hesitation. Make sure you look all yhrough the box so you don't accidentally throw the cord out.",2022,09
"I bought the JBL Xtreme 3 speaker a few years back and loved it. This one was purchased as a gift for someone who spends a lot of time outdoors and wood working, so the cover for the charging port was necessary. So far, there have been 0 issues and sound quality is great - to be expected from JBL speakers",2022,09
I bought this speaker for our boat. It works perfectly. We take it lots of places now. I love the sound quality and it is so easy to use.,2022,09
"Worked great for 3 months.  Then, deader than a hammer.  Will not charge. Tried everything.  Resets.  Cables. Everything.  Buyer beware!",2022,09
I purchased 1.  It was good.  All I could think about was how good two must sound (in stereo).  Second one arrived today and the pair exceeded my high expectations.  They sound amazing.  Get 2.,2022,08
Wish it was bigger. I’m using it out by the horseshoe pit and in my room at night. It sounds great but it’s not enough sound to rock the block. Battery life is shorter then what they say but probably lasts long enough to get thru whatever your doing.,2022,08
I got this for my mother and she loves it.,2022,08
Perfect,2022,08
Amazing Sound Quality. Happy Purchase!,2022,04
"Not into the latest commercial fads but I am very impressed by these radios. The size and sound is about the same as a high end radio. This streaming radio has an unlimited operating range along with solving many of the problems associated with ""bad reception"". Truly a revolutionary breakthrough for the still strong radio listening audience. Living in NYC I am now able to clearly listen to one of my favorite radio stations from Massachusetts along with one in my area that has a weak signal. I love its portability along with its apparently long rechargeable battery life. Have listened to higher rated more costly products of the same size but honestly hear very little difference. I own a much higher end, powerful, stereo system for a more engaging musical experience. A well designed, water resistant, portable unit that can be used at home or outdoors. Have fun finding some of your out of area (online) radio stations and enjoy this wonderful new technology...",2022,09
Excellent quality,2022,09
This speaker is the best,2022,09
SIL loves it so that's good.,2022,09
It’s loud and great sound quality. It keeps a charge pretty good. It hasn’t died on me yet once and I use it a lot.🙃,2022,09
"WOWWWW....Not only did I get this in four hours, its fabulous!!  I highly recommend this!!!  Based on other reviews, i took my chances!UPDATE: I thought it was junk, I had it plugged into one of those USB strips...bad idea!  They couldn't keep the charge.  I got a usb plug and into the wall socket.  started charging super fast.  I cancelled my return!  Love this!",2022,09
Excelente,2022,09
Great investment,2022,09
"great stereo, easy to bring anywhere, and waterproof",2022,09
buy it and love it!! you won't regret it!,2022,09
Still happy with it!,2022,09
"Can not believe how long the battery lasts, very crisp and clear sounds, way louder than it looks. Yes it actually is water proof.",2022,09
battery seems bad,2022,09
Great sound and easy to carry around.,2022,09
"This is our 3rd one, they all connect together, great sound and easy to use!",2022,09
Perfect,2022,09
"After doing ample research I think JBL is the way to go for Bluetooth speakers.  The sound quality is great, battery life is long and it’s a great addition to any beach trip or backyard bbq.  After reading a lot of reviews I settled on the Charge 4 bc it seemed to have the most positive feedback and least amount of glitches.",2022,08
" I works fine the first couple of weeks, but now it doesn’t work, I connected with different cables and outlets and I just show that is charging til the first two lights blinking but it doesn’t fully charge, I also try to reset it but reset it doesn’t workI usually never do review but I don’t see my option the refund or get a new one.",2022,08
It fills the room with great sound and base.,2022,08
"I spend a lot of time working with music, esp. mixing, mastering, composing.I wanted a speaker I could enjoy while I was at the skatepark w my friends, something that could get loud and sound really good. I heard JBL was pretty popular and had a good reputation, but I was dissappointed with the Charge 4.In terms of build quality, it's a nice speaker. It feels sturdy and looks good. But as soon as I turned on a song, I was shocked by the quality of audio. The mid frequencies were boosted and they made audio sound muddy and unpleasant. For a $114 speaker, that was a real letdown.I checked out their app hoping for some sort of software update/tune up, but it's very bare bones and didn't have anything to help. I also checked if ""bass mode"" was on, and it was from the start.I went into my phone's EQ settings and manually changed the spectrum to my liking. If you own this speaker, I recommend you (moderately) raise the lows, duck the mids, and raise the highs. That made the speaker a lot more pleasant. But as soon as I did that, it took a loss on its max volume.The skatepark I go to is pretty small, but has metal ramps that get loud. This speaker wasn't enough for the park. It's definitely okay if you're at a small picnic, in an apartment, etc. But it doesn't get as loud as I was hoping.Overall, this speaker isn't worth the price. For an allegedly reputable brand it's absurd the sound quality doesn't come good from the start. It felt like I paid $115 for a JBL logo.What I think I'll do is buy from a cheaper brand and do the EQ tuning myself.Hope this helps, have a good week!",2022,08
Love these jbls great sound,2022,08
Just buy it! Best speaker I’ve ever owned. Perfect for the beach days. Sound quality is great and not difficult to connect to Bluetooth!,2022,08
 Quality is good! Dunno yet how ling the battery life is but just make sure to charge before going somewhere! Recommended!,2022,08
"I bought this product and after months of use it already won’t charge,light up ,work ,biggest waste of money do not buy",2022,08
i like how compact it is and it has a good bass,2022,08
I like that it easily paired up with my phone. I liked the bass it had and loud it could go,2022,08
The quality is great!  I’m going to buy another one for the upstairs.,2022,08
"Product is sub par. So many things bad, is that enough for me to submit. It’s terrible don’t buy it. Sound quality Bluetooth and battery life sucks. I did mention all your recommendations. That’s an honest review, don’t buy this product!",2022,08
Did not work out of the box,2022,08
"I've been a JBL guy since the 70's (shows my age I guess).  My experience with JBL has been great.  They make great speakers that provide the best sound for the buck in my opinion.  That said, there are so many choices today for speakers, many more than 50 years ago it can be difficult to choose. If you are looking for a great little bluetooth speaker with a great sound you can do no better than this JBL Charge 4.  It pairs very easily and quickly with whatever source, iphone or ipad in my case.  The sound is terrific for such a small package.  Other blutetooth speakers I have tried can't compare in sound or reliability.  I use it on my patio, and the range and volume for the area are perfect.  Battery seems to be real plus, I am still running on the first charge.  It's  also rated very well by Consumer Reports.  You can't go wrong with the JBL Charge 4.",2022,08
The speaker is powerful,2022,08
Really fills the room with sound for such a small device. Struggles with heavy bass in some hip hop music selections but for every other genre the sound is clean and louder than I expected.,2022,08
"This gives amazing sound. The bass is clear, heavy sound and the treble is crisp and sharp. The volume is amazing, too. Could fill a room or patio. The battery life is great, many hours per charge. The fact that it’s waterproof is an added bonus. Also, my phone found it immediately, no messing around or effort nEeded. Great buy for the price.",2022,08
Great Speaker!!  It really cranks and totally an impressive item for the price!!,2022,08
I work in a warehouse environment driving powered equipment. This speaker last my entire 11 hour shift and has taken multiple falls and impacts without getting damaged. Love it.,2022,08
The Sound quality is extraordinary and the battery life is also great,2022,08
"These charge 4 speakers are great. I bought 2 more to go with a couple I already had. They easily sync up with each other which makes it easy to fill larger spaces with great sound. If you put them in corners, they sound even fuller. I wish that the Charge 4 still had to ability to take phone calls, but I guess that isn’t that big of a deal. The batteries have listed all day and more. It is also handy that I can charge my phone from them as well.",2022,08
"Unlike most people who use speakers like this for fun, I used it for work. As a FedEx Express courier, not only did our bigger trucks not have working climate controls, arm rests, cruise control, or insulation from the elements, we don't have speakers! Imagine hours on the road in a loud tin can shaking and rattling every which way with no music to soothe your stress!So one night I decided, no more of that. This speaker fit right into the passengers ""seat"", and I would strap the seatbelt just incase (the trucks had world class terrible suspension, the smallest bump in the road would send anything not strapped down flying).With that, at full volume in the truck that battery might last around 4 or 5 hours. But man oh man on full volume it would tune out the road noise, tin can truck doors rattling against the metal body, everything. It made my driving experience so much better. That being said, I would only need full volume on the highway (did you know Express trucks are governed to 65mph? Well, assuming our trucks could even easily reach that. At least in my station they all had check engine lights and I once timed that it took 27 seconds to go from 40mph to 65mph. Fun!) and when I was driving from 30-50mph having the speaker at ~70% was fine. At that rate I could make it last about 8 hours before needing a recharge.I thank JBL for creating such a great speaker and frankly I am sure their other products have that battery capacity I needed, but I got this on sale and it fit right into my backpack. For the situation I was in, it was a total game changer. I went from messy stressy anger to happily singing along to my favorite songs. On the off-chance another courier reads this, making it your routine to turn the speaker off on your way out the door will save battery. I will have fond memories of driving down my route playing music and singing my heart out for those precious few moments where the stress was pushed to the back of my mind.Luckily I do not work there anymore and this speaker will not see daily use, but when I needed it, my life was much better for it. It sat next to an open door in an Isuzu Reach and never moved a centimeter, providing me with amazing sound all the while. I know now anything and everything I might throw at it will never take it down. If battery life is your concern, it is valid. If you want the best sound for the size of the speaker, this is hard to beat, and it has my ""doing deliveries in a tin can with an open door on a road at 45mph still sounding good"" seal of approval!",2022,08
Sound quality is excellent. Great bass sound too. Connects instantly to my iPhone. Battery life is amazing. I use it a few hours almost every day and it lasts the whole week.,2022,08
"I love it connects quick and Bluetooth range is good, good sound.",2022,08
Live it,2022,08
I use for music,2022,08
"This is my 5th or 6th JBL Charge 4 that we have purchased, either for us or for a gift to someone else! Love how you can connect all of them together for an exceptional sound experience! Battery life is very long too. Would highly recommend!",2022,08
The battery died in a week. Doesn't charge...,2022,08
"I loved this speaker, until it decided to not work. It now turns on and immediately turns off. It’s about a year old and only a handful of uses. Mostly used it in the garage. Fully charged battery, but acts like it’s dead. I read it could be the battery, installed a new battery, and that’s not it. I wouldn’t buy another one. I contacted JBL, and they said that it was out of warranty and that since I attempted to replace the battery, it voided it. Which I understand. Just stinks that it took a premature crap out on me.",2022,08
This is the best Bluetooth speaker I have ever owned. It charges my phone as I listen to what seems endless hours of music.  Great sound quality.,2022,08
Sound quality is amazing I use it for work loud enough where I can hear over the loud equipment and last all day highly recommend this device,2022,08
"This is waterproof, but I have not gotten it wet yet. It is a nice size and has really good sound. The blue tooth connectivity is fast.",2022,08
"I love the sound quality, the portability and the color",2022,08
"Purchased this item in May of this year. Quit working, will not charge. Amazon would not refund full amount, charging me an 20% restocking fee. Very disappointed in Amazon for not helping a loyal customer.",2022,08
The speaker came charged but would never charge again. Thankful the initial charge lasted so long I didn’t even notice it was defective until after the return window. Huge waste of money.,2022,08
Relax on my home,2022,08
"I love the JBL speaker. Hassle free when it comes to pairing it to my phone. The sound quality is amazing, as well as the sleek look. I have had better battery life with other speakers, but overall GREAT purchase.",2022,08
Very good quality and great sound!,2022,08
this speaker completely stopped charging after less than 2 months. terribly disappointed,2022,08
Love the sound! It’s clear and crisp would recommend it !,2022,08
Purchased this as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it. He takes it everywhere while he’s working and the battery life is great. Definitely a good purchase!,2022,08
"Product sounds fine for what I need it for.  However, the size of the product is much smaller than it appears online.",2022,08
This is the easiest we have ever had anything connect via bluetooth! Sound is great and so far we have not had to recharge it. Will try to follow up in about a year. Highly recommend.,2022,08
The sound is really good. It connects to Bluetooth quickly and is extremely portable. I love it and recommend it!,2022,08
"Great sound, loud, and it floats! Definitely worth it compared to the competitors.",2022,08
JBL Bluetooth/wireless speakers are by far the best purchase you can make if you are looking for something with long battery life and awesome sound quality. I own 2 of these and use them both daily. 10/10!,2022,08
"JBL is beautifully designed.Sounds just perfect.The only problem is if you give it to your daughter for her eighteenth birthday, 2 days later, she may irresponsibley drive around town with it in her car and leave it at her friend's house for 2 weeks, then one of her friends will likely steal it because it is such a fantastic little speaker.  Just take that into consideration before purchasing.",2022,08
Great product Great sound! Not much difference between the new ones and I got this for 40 dollars cheaper than the new ones and it was definitely worth it!,2022,08
I love the speaker works great... I wish it came with a better instruction manual for all of the features.,2022,08
Too expensive,2022,08
Caught this on sale and for the price the quality is unbeatable!,2022,08
Great,2022,08
"Okay so I ordered the jbl speaker because my Mother’s Day was coming up and my mom had always wanted her own speaker, gifted it and it was working fine until like the 2nd month of having it it would shut off and on, and it just won’t stay on even tho we’ve charged it all night and still it won’t function, so I until I get an answer back or a way I can fix this not so happy with it, but other family members have purchased and came out fine so i really don’t know what happen!",2022,08
We take it every where beach/camping/bbqs,2022,08
Boating.,2022,08
Great sound. Portable good on beach’,2022,08
So I loved this speaker. Until it just gave up on me after nothing even close to twenty hours of playtime advertised on Amazon. Pretty bad. I think I’m going to return it.,2022,08
This speaker is definitely not the loudest but decent for the price. Built well durable bass quality and sound quality good not great. Very serviceable but they have higher quality and loader speakers available for more money.,2022,08
Love the JBL CHARGE.  Only complaint is you have to be careful which one you buy IF you want to pair them together.  Charge 4 and charge 5 will NOT pair together.  Besides for what I need in the warehouse the charge 4 is great.,2022,08
"The connect doesn’t stay connected, and the BT will lose connection if more than 2 ft away!!! *** @JBL - YOU WRONG FOR THIS!!!! Pure Trash!!!!!!! And You know it!!!!",2022,08
"My husband absolutely loves it and the quality of the sound. He takes it to work, in vacation and outside when he is working in the back. Excellent value!",2022,08
best Bluetooth speaker ever.,2022,08
"Really nice product works perfect, really good sound quality and the battery gives you a lot of time",2022,08
The sound quality is amazing!,2022,08
Bought this for a canoe trip.  We ended up in the water - so happy to have my new speaker float next to me while we put ourselves back in the canoe.  Wonderful sound!,2022,08
"Sounds great,  easy to set up. Fast shipping",2022,08
Great,2022,08
This little thing sounds great.,2022,08
Product stinks,2022,08
It was loud enough thought it would do better on sound overall everything else is good,2022,08
The sound is great and it's very easy for old people to use.,2022,08
Bluetooth connection of the speaker is very annoying. It gets disconnected often times and also delivery of the music is slow.,2022,08
Great sounds Bluetooth connectivity is soo easy,2022,08
I personally believe they are the best in the speaker business. Great sound quality on every Bluetooth that I have heard and price is reasonable,2022,08
Love this speaker!  So easy to connect with Bluetooth. I bring her everywhere!!!  Sound quality is awesome and it’s even water and sand resistant!  One charge has been good enough for 5 beach days already and still good to go,2022,08
"Sounds good but so many of these companies spend more budget on marketing spinners rather than solid honest technology.The talk of 2 of these producing stereo via the app may or may not be true.  I don't mind buying two but this intentional vagueness really sucks.We need more engineers and less marketers in this world.  Engineers with budgets build good stuff, marketers dance and hide stuff.No mic for phone calls.  :(I will update when abd if I find the time to unravel the intentional fog.  Others seem to have plenty of comments which may have good info.Happy with the mono sound so far, will keep, for now.",2022,08
My bf loves it! I love that you can use it as a charger when out and about. The sound qaulity is amazing I would recommend.,2022,08
"This speaker is what you would need if you want something thats loud but has a great bass, even on a low volume this speaker has a incredible bass , the sound at just 50% of the volume sounds really loud . The battery life is as it promises , In my experience I played from 100% of battery at 50 percent of volume for up to 5 days until it died",2022,08
Much louder than other models with solid base sound. Can easily be heard through walls! Thanks son.,2022,08
Great sound and battery life. Price is also right!,2022,08
This is the perfect little speaker that has great sound! Picks up everything from hip-hop to edm to instrumental. Very good quality sound. And the Bluetooth connection is the easiest I’ve ever used. I get from my car to the house and it instantly picks up the music,2022,08
Didn't get the charging cable or the instruction book as described. Must be a used or returned item.,2022,08
Expected better volumeBut its ok,2022,08
Just bought it a week ago and thus far nothing to complain about.  My son had had one do quite a while and he has had no issues so I'm not anticipating any either.,2022,08
Love my new speaker! Sound is great and easy to set up!,2022,08
Works great with blue tooth,2022,08
"I use this for when I am showering, and got it to replace a Bose BT speaker, that is about 10 years old.  It was no longer holding a charge, and kept disconnecting from the BT.  The sound is so good, I've taken it around the house with me.  It came partially charged, so I fully charged it before I used it.  I've had it for 3 weeks now, and haven't had to charge it yet!  The sound quality is incredible.  The bass is window shaking!  If you are on the fence, get it.  It's supposed to be waterproof too, but haven't tested it.  I love it!",2022,08
It was nice for the week. Then it stopped working.,2022,08
"This is my second JBL Charge 4. I use mine at the pool, it completely waterproof. It’s been thrown in the pool and never stops playing. Works about 8 hours between charges and now that I have 2 I connect them together for surround sound.",2022,08
Excellent portable Bluetooth speaker!Sound is very goodBluetooth range is excellentBattery is solid.. lasts a long time!,2022,08
"Connectivity and battery life are great. Connectivity directs can be confusing but it works. I have four now, two at the pool, one on the deck and one at corn hole boards.Last long enough for a good party!",2022,08
I love the clarity and the bass especially how loud it gets.. Worth the 🤑 money!,2022,08
I got this because my son has had one for years and it produces excellent sound quality and volume.  good looking and very easy to use.,2022,08
"I love this speaker. This is like my 5th one, i have them all around the house. I can connect all of them togeather wirelessly and fill the whole house with great sounding musc.",2022,08

"I really like it , it's good is the first time you pay for something that is doing the job.",2022,07
"Sounds good, charge lasts a long time, I really like this product. It has gotten wet and continues to work like a champ.",2022,07
Bought this to replace my old jbl bluetooth speaker that finally bit the dust after years of being a pool speaker in the Texas heat. This one was a major upgrade. The sound is great and it connects easily every time I've used it. The battery seems to last forever too which is great.,2022,07
"Sounds and looks great, but in less than a month the charging port melted and started smoking. Electrical malfunction of some sort.",2022,07
"Love the device,  great sound charging length,  etc. Had one issue - charging cord came wit rust on metal ends - payed for NEW Ormsby,  not a refurbished one,  so didn't understand this",2022,07
Excelente,2022,07
I have been wanting a speaker for a while. This one was on sale on Amazon so I got it. Love the color! The battery lasts forever! Great sound. Took it tubing and it got a little wet but it does claim to be water resistant and it continues to work just fine.,2022,07
I been using the speaker for a while and I haven’t even charged it yet.,2022,07
Best purchase,2022,07
I bought this product to use in my art studio but I bring it outside all the time. The sound quality is great. I would buy another one if they can be linked.,2022,07
Loved it!,2022,07
My grandson said it is very nice and is plenty loud enough.He is happy with it.,2022,07
"Bought this at the beginning of July 22. only used it 3-4 times since I am usually listening to headphones coming back from work and don't bother to switch to a portable speaker. Turned it on toward the end of July while making dinner and it played for a few seconds then made a crackling noise and stopped playing. Hitting the play/pause button changes play/pause on my phone so I know it is connected but the speakers no longer work. No start up noise or shut down noise either. Never dropped, never got wet (even though it should be water proof), no abuse whatsoever. Just stopped working.Contacted customer support/warranty at JBL. If I get an appropriate response the review may be updated when I can actually use the product.",2022,07
Great sound easy to used.,2022,07
"Overall sound is good but doesn’t get very loud. I’m almost certain my Flip 4 was louder and more even in sound.This would be good with another to run in stereo, but the bass is still lacking unless you put it in a spot with a lot of sound deflection or a corner.",2022,07
Love the sound,2022,07
We love this speaker! Highly recommend! Sounds is great and it really is waterproof!,2022,07
"Nice bass...but not in stereo. Looks like it had two speakers, but no. Cost too high, maybe, for this trade-off to be worthwhile. Sorry.",2022,07
"I have always wanted the Charge 4, after purchasing the Flip 4. Now that I have it I love the sound. I can connect it with the other Flip 4's in party mode and it's great. I can also connect thru Bluetooth my laptop's audio which is great for Zoom meeting and streaming. It's a great product and I don't feel it will disappoint.",2022,07
Good Speaker. Good quality and sound.,2022,07
I got this one a flash sale so it was much bigger than I thought. But its really great. I dont have blue tooth in my car so I use this.,2022,07
"This is our second Charge 4, so we can have stereo.Awesome sound for the size and great battery life.",2022,07
It has Great bass,2022,07
Speaker sounds very loud and powerful!,2022,07
Bigger and heavier than my Sonos Roam but sounds a little better and it's cheaper.  Plus you can charge devices from it.,2022,07
"I bought the JBL Charge 4 in the summer of 2021.  12 months later and now it won't take a charge and shuts off within about a minute of turning it on while plugged in so it is completely unusable.  I'd assume that maybe I just bought a lemon but this has been a problem for all the JBL speakers I've bought.  I've owned the JBL earbuds, 3 JBL Clip 3 and 1 JBL Clip 4.  My JBL Clip 4 is the only one still working.  I'm going to try another brand because I'm tired of having to throw away speakers.",2022,07
:),2022,07
Clear sounds and very powerful. I love the red color makes it super fun.,2022,07
Great sound and easy to pair with Bluetooth. Only thing I didn't like was how long it takes to recharge. Would recommend in spite of charging time.,2022,07
"Loud, great quality Bass is everything! Strongly recommend!",2022,07
"I was really excited about buying this speaker when I bought it because I’ve needed it for a while and I have a lot of use for it at the moment. However, it has been completely unreliable for me because it hasn’t been able to hold a charge. I think it has only been charged fully 2-3 times and now it never charges. The chargers used are brand new and the speaker is brand new. I did a factory reset more than once and it still won’t charge. The light blinks as if it is charging but it stays dead. I am so disappointed in this purchase and I hope the speaker can be replaced or exchanged.",2022,07
"This item sounds great and looks great, but it doesn’t stay charged.So that makes it useless, or a decorative paperweight.",2022,07
Great sound system that easily connects to Bluetooth. I use this for outdoor workouts and it’s a total hit!!!,2022,07
Loudest speaker I've had to date and not very big or heavy so it's easy to throw in a bag and take with you where ever you go.,2022,07
Sound is true stereo,2022,07
We already owned the smaller version of this speaker and were pleased with the sound quality but were looking for a larger/louder one after our current speaker broke. We are pleased with our purchase!,2022,07
Great speaker. Good to very good sound quality. Charges phone quickly and it charges quickly as well.I am having a replacement sent though due to only one speaker really sending out music. The other is dull and crackled.,2022,07
The JBL is awesome. It has a crisp sound and it’s waterproof. It’s a great summer speaker. We love our jbl,2022,07
This is the 4th jbl 4 that we’ve purchased for ourselves and as gifts.  Great unit.,2022,07
Speaker sounds good! Connects quick and battery lasts a long time. Seems durable and well built,2022,07
Perfect for boating and camping,2022,07
"I tried to charge my phone from 40 percent and it killed the speaker.  They both died within a half hour with the speaker being fully charged. Not a deal breaker because the speaker does sound awesome,  just dont rely on a charge from it.",2022,07
"I ordered the charge 4 as I wanted a speaker with a little more volume and punch and compared to my JBL Flip 4, the flip 4 beats this larger speaker hands down. The sound quality is good on this Charge 4, Battery life is very good and it does have fair volume just not what I expected. Took the charge 4 camping and set it up on a table at our camp trailer, Went  out to the camp fire, people asked me to turn it up some. When I explained it was at max volume they were surprised. Luckily I brought my JBL Flip 4 and it performed much better even though it's a lot smaller.",2022,07
"Works perfectly fine, delivered on time. Only issue is that I received the wrong color. I ordered red and received grey.",2022,07
This was a gift for my son-in-law. He loves it and uses it throughout the house..,2022,07
Quality of sound is great yet the loudness is not sufficient per price.I’ve heard speakers that are sold for half the price with similar sound quality and louder volume.Considering a return,2022,07
"This thing is great !  Fantastic sound, battery lasts “forever”, and it has a big enough battery pack that you can charge several phones while using it (or not).  It was a big hit with everybody on a recent beach trip, some of which had spent way more on their speaker.",2022,07
" * I received this item as a gift off my wedding registry *Check out my video for more detail, but I love this speaker! The charge lasted me a full week when I was at the beach. It’s a super durable and I wasn’t scared to get sand in it. It goes super loud and super clear noise. Such a great speaker!",2022,07
We luv it!! Use it at the beach.. on house hold jobs.. great sound!!,2022,07
Great sound quality,2022,07
Speaker did not come with charger.,2022,07
For the price it should be much louder!,2022,07
Not bad sound but I thought it would be something else better …. Turned out to be same audio as a $80 off brand speakers 🔊 3 stars for that and 5 stars for Bluetooth connectivity and battery life,2022,07
Best speaker ive ever gotten,2022,07
In love!! It’s mine and My friends go to speaker!,2022,07
"I bought this for my significant other, Solin,he uses JBL PA self powered speakers on stands in his recording studio and on gigs.  He’s a perfectionist and he hears everything in music if a speaker has too much high end, it’s too bright!!!! he likes a warm analog type of sound,He loves the Beatles and portrayed John Lennon in Beatlemania, so he has a heavy Beatles influence on his original music.My 13 year old nephew visited with this JBL Bluetooth and I was delighted that Solin loved it and he said of course it’s great it’s a JBL.We absolutely love this speaker great quality great price.",2022,07
"Love this speaker!! Barely have to charge it, battery holds up great! We use outside at our pool and I can charge my phone on it while using!",2022,07
"The battery made it two years but, now it no longer holds a charge and the charge 4 has to be plugged in at all times to work. Battery can no be changed out. Only a one year warranty and that doesn’t include battery issues. I previously had a Bose and they stand by their products including dead batteries.",2022,07
"It’s Fabulous, love it! Sometime when I walk away with my phone it drops the round but that’s probably more my bad. Love it! Recommend it! Specially since I got mine on sale.",2022,07
"Has great sound, Bluetooth connects fast and great battery like. I would buy it again.",2022,07
I originally bought the Sony more bass model and swapped it out for this JBL.  The JBL blew it away!  I’m a sound nut and for the size of these speaker they sound great.  But two and pair them and get great stereo sound.  Buy more than Two and pair them all and the stereo sound goes away.  So I ended up with just two of them and they are perfect.  Be sure to download the app to get the stereo sound setting.  Put one at each end of the pool and float away to great sound.,2022,07
I bought one for my daughter years ago.  Now it was my turn to have great sound.,2022,07
"Haven't had any problems with it, So far love it.",2022,07
"I love this speaker a lot. Very clear, love the charger option",2022,07
Portability..,2022,07
"Larger than I had expected, but fine, redder too ! Very impressive sound from JBL again. Good features, but you need to ensure the cover of the ports is tight...I can see leak paths...Very happy with it and the price paid. Great value.",2022,07
Sound is great and easy to connect to Bluetooth.  Does not advise when battery is low,2022,07
"This speaker does not hold its charge, and to top it off you can’t use it while charging. I have an anker speaker that was much cheaper and it actually works better. I had purchased the JLB for fathers day thinking it would be an upgrade for my husband but I was proven wrong. If the return window was still open I would return it.",2022,07
"Battery life and sound quality are great, very happy with my purchase :)",2022,07
I’ve had the same JBL speaker for almost 8 years now and decided I finally wanted to upgrade for better sound. I am so glad I did. The sound quality is a lot better than I had even thought it would be. I highly recommend this speak to anyone looking for something that’s portable with great sound,2022,07
I like everything about this speaker. I have the black one and the camo. Great sound. Get the equalizer app on play store and you can customize your sound to your preferences.,2022,07
"I bought this to replace my 7 year old UE Boom. There was nothing wrong with my boom I just wanted an upgrade (So I thought). It was bigger than my UE Boom which was no big deal. But after I charged the JBL, and connected it I was very disappointed. The sound was very muffled. I hooked up my boom to a friend's phone and played the same sound on both....what a huge difference. In my opinion the UE Boom blows this JBL away.",2022,07
I just recently bought two of them to be able to sync both speakers up together and it just makes the atmosphere of where you are just that much better. We just recently went out to the river and it was great to have them both connected since we could have one in the water and one with everyone else who was sitting down. the range on these are pretty decent as well and the battery can easily last all day but only if its not to max volume. great speakers though and I highly recommend.,2022,07
 Love this speaker! I’m going to buy a second one so I can pair them together,2022,07
"Weight just over two pounds.It’s not small enough that you can easilly put it in backpack .Buttons on device are easily accessible, sitting along the top of the deviceThe JBL Charge 4 offers slightly better power output than previous incarnations of the JBL Charge, with a rated power of 30 Watts RMS. Additionally, the device uses USB Type C for charging, can achieve a full charge in 4 hours, and offer 20 hours of playtime on a full charge.The JBL Charge 4 does feature JBL Connect Plus, so it can be wireless connected to more than 100 other JBL speakers that also have JBL Connect plus. It is worth noting that you can’t connect a JBL bluetooth speaker with JBL Connect to a JBL speaker with JBL Connect Plus.",2022,07
"My life has changed! The sound quality of this battery is perfect for my space. Look we would all like perfect sound quality but the truth is so many factors determine sound quality, especially the recording itself. The JBL offers greatvpower. Turning down the volume usually helps with balancing the sound when played at higher levels. A winner!",2022,07
This is by far the best sound out of many bluetooth speakers that I have owned. Highly recommend!,2022,07
"The speaker is great it came charged so I got to use it immediately. I’ve had one before but it was a shared family speaker ,so now I can take mine wherever I want to and the color is cute . Great speaker over all sounds amazing and they stay charged for a long time.",2022,07
Went on a river float and now it's doesn't work! Not waterproof. Not going to buy this one again will have to research a bit for my next float,2022,07
"Looks Nice love water resistance, not Loud at all",2022,07
We have three. My husband and each of my teenage boys. My favorite part is we can synch all there and have surround sound in the backyard and around our pool.,2022,07
It received such low a rating due to its durability. Dropped from about 4Ft and was a paper weight after and wasn’t possible to fix.,2022,07
"I bought this as a Father’s Day gift for my dad, he was really excited for it. He said he loved the sound quality and the rich bass to it. Battery life is also solid and this little speaker is super loud!",2022,07
"Phenomenal Sound, Sturdy Quality, and Long Lasting Battery!",2022,07
"We bought 2 speakers to see which one we loved more. This was the note expensive one and after we tried then both, it wasn't even close. The quality of this speaker was awful compared to an off brand and it was half the cost. I wouldn't spend this type of money on it just for the name. There are better ones that are way better and cheaper.",2022,07
"This speaker seems very sturdy and durable. I don't plan to use it around water, so I'm won't comment on how well it works when wet.The sound is amazing for such s small device. Very rich tone and lots of bass. Overall I'm very satisfied!",2022,07
I had one of the first JBL can like speakers & it lasted about 10 years then it died. I found this one as a replacement & it's louder than the first one! I love it! Get 1!,2022,07
"Got this speaker as a replacement for my original refurbished UE mega boom. I played that thing full volume on many occasions and after 3 years, although still sounding great, I feel the speaker might have ruptured a bit. Decided to try JBL and didn’t want to get the Charge 5 because of the price and a tacky huge JBL in the front. I think old speaker models offer great value, as they sound great and are cheaper. So far so good with this JBL, plenty loud of course, haven’t been doing full volume yet, because cautious due to my previous UE experience. Love that it sits on its side and love the color. We will see how it will hold up, but so far great, just as expected from JBL.",2022,07
Works great would purchase again,2022,07
"It was a gift, I love it . The sound is great. I have’t had a lot of time to use it. But so far it’s  great.",2022,07
"I absolutely love this speaker for work, would like more if it gave notice to charge before it just shuts off",2022,07
"These speakers have deep base and great sound. Outside they are wonderful. Beach, pool thy get thee sound out. The battery 🔋 is also a great powerhouse for your phone at the beach.",2022,07
"The poor reviews are sometimes exaggerated, but the one I read is correct. My hearing isn't what it used to be. When I waa younger, I listened to some very wonderful equipment owned by me and some friends. My experience includes used to playing the saxophone and other musical instruments. I can recognize when music and/or voices are not in tune. I have even been ""accused of perfect pitch."" With that said, I can say that the Charge 4 is a horrible reproducer of sound. I own four JBL Flip 4 speakers and they do great job for their size.However, the Charge 4 has a sound profile of loud but muddied bass, hollow sounding mids and a really poor attempt at the highs. Tinny sounding like listening to an old AM only transistor radio. The Flip 4 is so much better, especially in pairs. Owning 4 allows me to have two fully charged until the other pair is discharged. I bought a single Charge 4 for an anticipated abusive future. I will be moving soon and as I put things in storage and load trucks and trailers, I wanted something that if damaged, it wouldn't break up my set of four.I thought the other reviewer may have received a ""lemon."" Ithought there is no possible way JBL would send out a mono speaker especially if the sound is not centered. The sound is ""centered"" about two inches from center. It is very annoying to me. Outside moving my belongings would be make this design flaw less noticible to imperceptible. I will return this and get something else.",2022,07
Great,2022,07
"I’ve had this for one month, it was inconsistent on how long the charge lasted from new. And now it won’t charge at all!",2022,07
"I like the sound but I'm so sick of carrying two or three speakers around for a days with of music.  Doesn't matter what model.  UE might not sound as good but the battery life is much better.  JBL, just give me a product that delivers.  I'm not holding on your support lines for let's try this.  Charge, flip 4 it 5, megaboom box, GO3, ... I've spent way too much money with you.  I'm done.",2022,07
Sound really good.,2022,07
I like that it has a flat bottom that let's the speaker be more stable now. We got one for my husband and my son. They love them.,2022,07
After one charge it stopped charging anymore,2022,07
Absolutely love it easy to use carry around. I mainly use it in my basement for when I’m working out,2022,07
"Great for the first year, but even I last longer than this thing does. 🔋 Pathetic.",2022,07
Already had one and loved it and got another for a second home.,2022,07
"We used this on a family campout and had great results.  The volume range is great, sound quality is great, and connectivity with our iPhones is great.  The extra charge capacity is very handy as well.",2022,07
"Excellent sound, easy connectivity for blue tooth, great battery life.",2022,07
"The product is just fine & looks like a JBL, but clearly they lied about a 20 hours worth of music battery life.I plan on returning it and just going to a big box store next time.",2022,07
I’m very happy with this Bluetooth Speaker. It’s sounds terrific and is pretty powerful in an open room.,2022,07
I love this speaker.  If your looking for a good one this is it!!,2022,07
I just got this two days ago.  If this won’t work after charging it two nights in a row. I’m sure it’s garbage!,2022,07
Got great sound anywhere  you take it,2022,07
These speakers are great bang for the buck. Got another to connect them together. Unfortunately my renewed unit was wonky. Fortunately the return process was super easy. While deciding to give renewed another try I got a new one for Father’s Day. Perfect,2022,07
my speaker wont charge and i just purchesed it i owned other jbl speakers but this is the first time i get a defetive product,2022,07
Great sound. Good value,2022,07
"I have had a Flip and a Clip before I bought the Charge. The sound quality is always great, battery life always seems to last longer than I need, and it always connects with no problem. The Clip is usually in my bathroom clipped to the shower rod, and the Charge is great for larger outdoor parties, or to have sound throughout the house. I find them esthetically pleasing and they blend in to my decor while giving great sound. This Charge was on sale and I got it for less than $100 - can’t beat that for the quality.",2022,07
I received my speaker and put it to charge and it never charged. Light will turn to show its charging but it never actually does. I call customer service and they said they will send me the return label through email and they never did.,2022,07
Great quality speaker! My hubby loves the camo color one. A little pricey but got it when it went on sale.,2022,07
Battery goes dead quickly and not as loud as other brands with same size.,2022,07
Great product sounds great!,2022,04
"I've had this unit for several years.  The sound is fine.  As some have described, the sound is definitely on the warm end of the spectrum and the highs are a bit lacking, but the performance is better than expected at this price point.  Anyway, no one should expect super high fidelity from a low cost portable speaker.We use ours to stream music when we are by the pool or in the hot tub, and to listen to audiobooks around the house.  It is great for these applications.  The battery lasts a long time - we often go a week or more without needing a charge.  The USB-C connection is handy now that more and more devices are using this standard.The Bluetooth connectivity is outstanding.  It connects seamlessly and reliably and seems to have quite good range.  Far less finicky and fussy than other Bluetooth devices we use.The unit is durable!  Although advertised as water resistant and absolutely not spec'd for this, my unit fell into the hot tub and floated there for two days.  I was wondering where it went.  Looked all over the house.  My spouse suggested checking the hot tub.  Sure enough, there it was.  I expected it to be dead.  Nope!  It's fine!I do not recommend immersing the unit in water.  I am sure we got lucky.  Nevertheless, we were impressed!",2022,07
Good buy!,2022,07
"Love this speaker! This is the second one we have purchased! Very durable, we take it on our ATVs and camping. My husband also uses it at work. He’s in construction so it has to have good sound! Highly recommend!!",2022,07
"Loud, sounds great! Super easy to connect Bluetooth, lasts a long time between charges. I love this so much!",2022,07
Absolutely love the sound from this speaker!,2022,06
great speaker,2022,06
"Love everything about it so far, just hope it works longer than some of the other ones I've purchased.",2022,06
Great Sound.,2022,06
I shopped around for a while great speaker sound excellent. Very happy,2022,06
I love it.,2022,06
The sound is clear and crisp.  We often us it in our camper and outside around the fire pit.  We love this speaker!,2022,06
"This is a JBL speaker, so I mean it is great quality. There are many other speakers in the same price range that do not compete in quality or sound.",2022,06
When its hot outside.......the heat makes it skip or it does something to it. I really wanted it mostly for outside. Disappointing that its not good in the outside summer months,2022,06
Love the color,2022,06
I love it,2022,06
"If u try connecting two or more the music is delayed and jumpy, like they are buffering it and not sure whos playing what or when. When they are solo they kick ass.",2022,06
Awesome little speaker with loud sound. Perfect for travel. It’s charge last a very long time.,2022,06
Not loud enough. Strange soud quality makes music sound wierd.,2022,06
Sound quality is great. We bought this for the pool and the boat. It’s plenty loud and battery stay charged for hours.,2022,06
Easy to connect. Great sound. Very portable. Long battery life. What more could you ask for??,2022,06
"I don't consider myself an audiophile by any means but I know what I like. Connectivity with my Sony NW-A105 was a snap and the sound quality was quite a surprise. It was a rich, full sound and I did not detect any distortion. I played everything from Bocelli through Journey, Bon Jovi, Jason Aldean and Queen. It all sounded great to me. I love this speaker! 🤩",2022,06
Disappointed no usb or booklet supplied.,2022,06
It’s pretty good and got on sale for good deal . Battery life is true 20 hour use . Wish was a little more bass but other than that happy with purchase . Pretty loud bought two . Love the fact that they can connect together .,2022,06
"I thought going up to the JBL 4 would be better, but I was disappointed with the sound quality as it didn’t sound as full. The base wasn’t there.  Not as full as the JBL 3. Should have purchased another JBL 3.",2022,06
I just opened this item and already love it. Sound quality is amazing (loud and clear) and it connected to my phone right away. It arrived on time and was nicely packaged.,2022,06
I had one of these already so I wanted to get a second one to tie into the others.  It will not stay on for more than 30 seconds.  It will not take a charge.  I have run the factory reset process several times with success for about one week.  I then have a speaker with no charge again.,2022,06
The charge 3 was much better . Charge 4 that I originally bought did not have the same dynamic range and was water proof . Surfing paddleboarind fishing never broke . Charge 4 broke 2 times now in water and breaks up all the time,2022,06
Perfect size with enormous sound,2022,06
"I've only had this for a week but love the clarity and bass sound.I used to play from a smaller but loud speaker and the sound of this baby is just astounding, like a true sound system, but with the benefit of taking it everywhere with me.",2022,06
Super,2022,06
The sound quality is very good and it is easy hold and carry around. I think it is better to buy additional case to protect it and carry around more easily.,2022,06
"This thing bumps to the the point my neighbor gets out of bed, puts on their robe, walks the100ft to my door and politely, but sternly asks ""Yo can you turn down the Bieber"". 10/10",2022,05
"I love this Bluetooth speaker so much, but recently it has stopped charging. I’ve done all of the trouble shooting and have handled it with care since I got it. Really upset that I can’t get it to charge anymore, and now I can’t even get it to stay on. Just outside of warranty. I’m upset I don’t know if I will be buying JBL again. Beware!",2022,06
"Would give it 5 stars if I didn't have to wait so long for it to arrive. Speaker is great tho, sound is amazing!",2022,06
I don’t like one thing… made in China!,2022,06
"Units has incredible battery life, great sound and water proof. Use it every time I go to the pool, beach or outdoors.",2022,06
Great sound. Have one on my patio and one with my camping gear,2022,06
This speaker is far more that what I expected. I own a smaller veraion of it and the battery dies fast. This one on the other hand is a little bigger but the sound is great and the battery life OMG!,2022,06
The rating on this item is far from reality. The speaker sounds like it is busted and the bass crackles. Not so sure how this has the rating it does.,2022,06
"It was so good, I bought another in Teal!",2022,06
"Love this speaker - excellent quality, good price and speedy delivery. Connection is easy too!",2022,06
Have the 4 and the 5. Both great,2022,06
Perfecf for the beach pool or park,2022,06
"I've been throwing a pair of these in pools, hot tubs, the lake - my favorite party trick is the bass spraying water off the sides when you take it out of the water. Yes these are Mono.. thats why you buy two and they pair up with just a single button press on each!! You do have to use the JBL app to marry them into stereo mode but hell... you can't even sync Bose speakers without an app! My only complaint with these? THEY DON'T PLAY MUSIC UNDER WATER LOL. Seriously... get two - you won't be disappointed. The battery wore out in my ""renewed"" one I bought for $69... can't complain because it owes me nothing and I ordered an upgraded battery for it for $35 which brings it to the full price of one of these after beating on it for 3 years. Literally beating on it - taking them EVERYWHERE.",2022,06
"The sound of this small unit fills my living room. For the money, I would recommend this. I like that it can connect to other devices and give a full surround experience!",2022,06
Is there a better Bluetooth/waterproof/rugged speaker out there?I don't believe it. Amazing product,2022,06
"Sound is great, Loud and very deep Bass tone. Wife loved it.",2022,06
Easy to use and sounds amazing!,2022,06
My husband has been wanting a speaker like this for a while! This was a Deal of Day so I jumped on it.  He is so happy with this speaker.  Thanks for a great deal and extremely fast shipping!!!!!,2022,06
I’ve had this For about a year or two now and it works amazing. I have had it  fully submerged underwater and just being splashed also take us in the shower or gets a little steamy and it works perfectly and all those different conditions. I like to listen to podcasts or music when I go to sleep. So I usually have this playing when I go to bed and it lasts overnight and usually for like a whole week but I usually have my podcast Or music on for only an hour or two but I have the speaker on all night. If that makes sense. The speaker is also really loud and it connects to other JBL speakers really easily which I like. I like to listen to music when I ride my bike so I bought this strap for the JBL speaker which connects it to my bike and The JBL speaker works really well on it. I really recommend this product.,2022,06
I ordered the teal charge 4 and was sent the camo one a little disappointed and it only comes with charging cord not wall plug especially the money u pay for this speaker,2022,06
Perfect. Just what I needed 😊,2022,06
So glad I purchased this for my business! Portable and amazing sound,2022,06
"I just got this in the mail, opened the Amazon box and found it like this. I haven’t even opened yet! I hope it’s not damaged ://",2022,06
This is my 2nd speaker!  The sound is amazing and I love that I can connect the two speakers to make a mini suround sound!,2022,06
Doesn’t have as long of a battery life as stated in the details of the product. Other than that I’m 100% satisfied with my purchase and the quality of the product!,2022,05
Battery life and quality is almost ok. ---- I have a SONY XB-22 5 years old and the power and sound quality is better than this one.  I hoped more power in the new cargo jbl but i am dissapointed. overall it is a good speaker for casual days.,2022,05
Bought as a birthday present for a friend and she loves it. Uses it on the boat every weekend.,2022,05
"Bought this to replace my old JBL Flip. Was hoping that going a little bigger would bring some better low end, but I'm disappointed. Nice looking speaker & connects easily but I was looking for better sound. This seems to really push a lot of mid range. I went with a Bugani M118 for half the price. It's bigger than the Charge 4 but the sound was way better in my side by side comparison.",2022,05
just what I expected ❗️❗️❗️ thanks,2022,05
The best 😃,2022,05
Heavy music with quality sound,2022,05
Used it indoors and outdoors,2022,05
"I brought this speaker as a surprise gift for my daughter who has had the Bose Companion speakers, which she enjoyed for years, but it was time to upgrade to bluetooth. This is our first experience with JBL so I did some comparison research between JBL  and Bose, of which we’ve had various products over the years. The sound is great, color beautiful, and size perfect. I begin using it as soon as I unpacked it. I initially thought the charge cord or guide were missing due to the separate packaging being camouflaged in the box (black on black should be reconsidered, maybe a sticker could be added). Otherwise, we are very satisfied with the purchase.",2022,05
"Just what I wanted I love it, very loud and heavy duty",2022,05
Great sound. Small and compact but very clear and loud. Great product.,2022,05
Great sound and long battery life!! Waterproof too!! I love this speaker. I just can’t seem to get it to link with my other JBL charge 4??,2022,05
"I bought a JBL charge in 2016 came with an extra long usb cord and power brick, now you get a measly 3 ft long cable",2022,05
It is normal that it only charge 5 hrs ?,2022,05
speaker is defective. it won't charge.,2022,05
I work in a big garage this speaker is a little softy I have the first one that came out in 2014 I ended up returning this and making my own Bluetooth speaker with the same amount of money running 150 watts Rockford fosgate speakers.jbl junk,2022,05
I literally dropped this speaker in the lake and it still works perfectly. Battery life is awesome and the sound quality is amazing. I take this speaker everywhere I go! Highly recommend!*****,2022,05
I’m an OONTZ ANGLE Guy. These JBL have way to much bass. I don’t know how this is 5 star product. They may be deaf or hard at hearing. It’s just straight bass.,2022,05
"I have one and my grandson has one and we love it, the sound is great it is easy to take places.",2022,05
"I got my order next day as promised, but I ordered the blu, as you can see it's not blue. Decided to just deal with the red I don't feel like going yhough the hassle of shipping it back plus I work 7 am to 7 pm when am I going to have the time. It dos sound great and syncs very easy.",2022,05
"I absolutely love this speaker. It’s been so reliable. I take it everywhere with me, and it’s CRAZY loud!! It has amazing sound quality and battery life. About to order another one!!",2022,05
Love it,2022,05
Excellent purchase . Bought as a gift for my son bday  and loved it!  Sounds great!  Bluetooth easy a definite 5 star purchase,2022,05
"So far its been really good! The sound is very nice and I love how fast it connects to the Bluetooth. When I receive a call the music stops and then when I end my call the music automatically continues which is something I really like. The battery life is so good. I haven’t charged this speaker once since it has arrived and I’ve been using it pretty much everyday and its still good on battery. It plays pretty loud at its highest volume.  So yeah, if you’re thinking about getting this speaker you totally should :)",2022,05
"Solid Bluetooth speaker connects quick, charges your phone quick, and good sound quality (pretty loud)",2022,05
Great compact speaker not as loud as I expected a JBL speaker to be. Does not hold 20 hours of battery life as advertised. My particular speaker is holding about 6 hours of charge prior to dying. Any suggestions from Amazon Customer service?,2022,05
This thing was worth every penny. I cannot believe the sound that comes from this tiny speaker. Very impressed.,2022,05
Very portable. Good battery life. Great sound quality,2022,05
"Purchased two, connection between the speakers is good but the Bluetooth connection between the source is by far the worst I have ever had. Constant clipping, does not matter if 2 ft apart or 20. A lot of sound when connected but will drive you crazy with the clipping. not worth the money, not even worth half the price. Do not buy. my mistake.",2022,05
Great sounding speaker!,2022,05
The quality is great!!! I would buy it again!,2022,05
"The sound quality of this is really amazing, and has great bass response. I don’t know how they do it, but I highly recommend it. It’s great having in the kitchen while I’m cooking.",2022,05
Such a huge size of a speaker and sub for it to perform badly next to a $60 competitive speaker that's half the size and cost and produces more noise and superior bass compared to this distorted speaker with no bass. Wouldn't recommend!,2022,05
"Great sound, battery lasts forever.",2022,05
This is my second one..To add to the one I have..great product that connects seamlessly with the other. Great sound and super durable,2022,05
"Easy to pair and stays charged for hours.  I bought it for gardening, the back deck  and beach trips.  Some other reviewers are disappointed in sound quality, but for the price it’s really a great deal. I have no complaints about the sound.  I wasn’t expecting $1000 sound for $100.  I listen to a wide variety of genres and I can’t fault this speaker.",2022,05
After turning it off it powers back on By itself. It will not stay off power cycles all night. Tried resetting and still does it.,2022,05
"Purchased in July 2021 and it worked until February 2022 when it failed to pair with my Macbook Pro.Repeated attempts to resolve issue using all available tech support, INCLUDING JBL tech support,. Failures all. Note that this item has a 1 year warranty. After much time/energy expended, JBL/Harman sent me a ""new"", i.e. refurbished Charge 4. mid-May, 2022.  Same story, it failed to pair after repeated attempts. Requested a refund...DENIED. If you buy this item from AMAZON or any other 3rd seller - you will NOT GET A REFUND.  If you must have this speaker, buy direct from JBL/Harmon...but please dont' bother if you are  aMAC owner.  Run away quickly from this dud.",2022,05
Best Speaker ever!,2022,05
"Great speaker,  everything they claimed it to be.",2022,05
Speaker just went out as in stopped working. I haven't had this product a year.,2022,05
Won’t play charging when battery life gets low. Another lemon from Amazon.,2022,05
Great sound for the money!,2022,05
Sound quality is excellent. No complaints here.,2022,04
"This is my 2nd JBL Bluetooth speaker.  I also own the JBL Charge 3.  Love both speakers. The sound is good for such a small speaker.  Small size , easy to take along.  The battery is GREAT...I can run this for hours on end and still more than 1/2 charged.  I think it has 18 battery life and I believe it.Waterproof too..nothing but love for this speaker!",2022,04
"Very convenient, super loud, love it!",2022,04
Great speaker at a reasonable price. This is the second one I bought.,2022,04
all good i use it for days on the boat and around the house.,2022,04
"I bought this for a cross country move in a moving truck with a bad radio, had one day of driving 18 hours and this thing still had 20ish percent battery left after running all of those 18 hours. Sound quality is great for a smaller speaker too.",2022,04
I love my speaker this was actually my second purchase. I’ve had my first one for almost 4 years and I use them everyday and in the shower and the quality is still the same as day one! The battery lasts forever. I would highly recommend!,2022,04
Battery life is amazing. Sound is decent enough.,2022,04
"This speaker had amazing sound with great volume! I also ordered it in pink, so it just looks great as well! The battery life is exceptional.",2022,04
Great little speaker with a pretty good sound! The battery lasts a really long time.,2022,04
"My sister bought one last year, and I had to have one! The sound is just beautiful!! Definitely worth the price.",2022,04
Playing music  when out in the yard,2022,04
This speaker has incredible sounds. Great value.,2022,04
"I bought this speaker to use at the beach as both a sound system and a recharger for my iPhone. It works great!!! Clear crisp sound, deep bass and super long battery life. When the iPhone’s battery gets low this speaker recharges and plays all at the same time!! I bought a carrying case and protective rubber bumper, to keep it safe during transport. I highly recommend this speaker.",2022,04
For self entertainment,2022,04
I purchased the speaker a couple months ago and it already stopped working! This is my 2nd one to stop working out of nowhere. Sad because I love the sound quality,2022,04
Came with speaker but no directions or charging cable.,2022,04
"I ordered a Charge 3 a while back and was very happy. I decided to get another one for a different place in my home. After seeing a Charge 4 was available and at the se price point as my older Charge 3, I ordered it. Out of the box it has the same great JBL quality. I was very happy to hear JBL did away with the annoying start up and shut down tones. Bluetooth connection is faster and the sound is fuller than the Charge 3. We get a more than advertised run time. Very well done JBL.",2022,04
Has ear phone input option good sound quality long battery life,2022,04
i love the speaker! But it didn't come with a usb cable like the description says. Nor did it have the manual. The only thing i got in the box was the speaker and that's it. :(,2022,04
Everything of this speaker is amazing and you’ll love it. I recommend getting it no matter what people say and what youtube videos say. If you can afford it get it,2022,04
Birthday gift for my husband and he loves it!He drives truck and love listening to music on his break vs the car radio!,2022,04
It's awesome,2022,04
Maybe I got a dud but the battery life is terrible! Lasts maybe 30 minutes if I am lucky.  Seller wouldn't return or replace but Amazon did. Got a new one and it works right.,2022,04
"Ive been a huge fan of the charge series since the charge 2, owning every speaker in between then and now. This speaker was seriously a very minor upgrade if not a downgrade from the charge 3... tbh the sound quality is still there, i personally prefer the sound of the charge 3 over this one i think due to the 3 having 2 drivers and this one having 1 single slightly bigger driver... the 3 seems to be alittle more bass heavy surprisingly since its slightly smaller... over all youre still getting the jbl signature sound, it still sounds great, i still think its worth 5 stars, waterproof abilities are amazing and the battery life is totally better, the battery on the charge 3 seemed to poop out on me but only after like 3 years which wasnt to hard to fix... maybe the number of the speaker is the life expectancy 0_o ?! Tune in next time to find out on stephens reviews!!!",2022,04
"sound quality is horrific, find a speaker like the jbl extreme 2 or 3 that has stereo sound instead. god awful even when plugged in with an aux connection instead of bluetooth. stay away form this product and heed the warning of the other reviews about this speaker only having mono sound",2022,04
Good value considering quality and price,2022,04
I like too much this product. Great sound and good connectivity. Battery lasts forever !,2022,04
"Only had my charge 4, for a week, but I love it.I would recommend this product,  super easy to set up.",2022,04
I bought this for my computer because the built-in speaker from my computer isn’t that good. I like listening to music while working and the music from the JBL speaker is loud enough to hear and not annoying.,2022,04
Easy to use and the sound is magnificent. Easy to take anywhere easy to use,2022,04
Great sound....bluetooth connectivity is impeccable....connect 10 times out of 10 with no issues.. I have purchased 2 of these and both meet sound quality standards.,2022,04
"I have used many different JBL speakers including the extreme 3 and honestly these littler ones are way more worth buying then the big expensive ""newer"" ones. Love my charge 4",2022,04
I have a 10 hour shift. I have it fully charged in the beginning of my shift and 6 hours later it’s already Done. Sounds is great battery sucks.,2022,04
"This is a little larger than the Charge 2, has longer battery life, gets a little louder than the Charge 2, but sound quality is about the same.",2022,04
"Love this little bullet!  For the money, it’s the best thing out there!",2022,04
I live it I got it for my self,2022,04
I loved my first one. I gave it away to a friend and ordered another using the Amazon buy again. The next one was about 2 inches bigger in length and about an inch larger in diameter. Seems like they shouldn’t have called it a replacement.,2022,04
This little Bluetooth JBL Speaker has big sound and the tone is balanced very well. The battery life holds for a long time. Just make sure you know you will need to change with your comfort laptop.,2022,04
"Great speaker for the beach. Gets loud, easy to carry and durable. Much preferred over our previous Ultimate Ears Boom 2 speaker.",2022,04
Great sound and very lite but 3 days to somewhat fully charge. And this is the second one I’ve had. JBL needs to think what kind of batteries they are using.,2022,04
Puts out great sound!Durable!Battery life hood!,2022,04
Cute! But base too loud.,2022,04
Six months after purchase the battery in the speaker stopped holding a charge. We used it maybe once a week and very lightly. Disappointing especially now that it is out of the return window…Good speaker aside from that…,2022,03
Easy to pair a second speaker.,2022,03
Purchased for home use.  It's wonderful to not have wires everywhere.,2022,03
"Works great. Packs a lot of power for the size, great sound quality. Highly recommend it.",2022,03
"Love the size of this speaker, and the battery life seems to last forever.  I use it every day around the house. The sound is so clear! great value",2022,03
The sound is amazing,2022,03
Easy to setUpVery good sound,2022,03
"I’ve had three other jbl Bluetooth speakers that sounded great, this one not so much.😬",2022,03
The sound and bluetooth quality is great.,2022,03
One hell of a speaker,2022,03
After using a friend’s for so long I just had to get my own.,2022,03
"I live in Florida and was searching for a loud speaker that my family & I can hear through all the wind & ocean noise. We are avid beach people and have ugobe through many beach speakers living previously in Hawai'i, Texas, South Carolina..etc.Pros:Sleek lookColor optionsLoud soundWaterproofHeavy enough to withstand steong beach windConsDoesn't show battery life in percentageWill not beep or alert you when the battery is about to die...the music will start to cut out. I guess that is your notice.Honestly, I still am not set on this speaker 100%. Might return it.My little H20 speaker beeped when it was going to die.For over $100, this speaker should show detailed battery life & beep when low.Otherwise a good little speaker.",2022,03
"I like how it sounds, even though was not the color i picked.",2022,03
"Poor sound quality, cuts in and out and sounds staticky, crackly.",2022,03
The speaker is faulty. It won’t turn off. If I press the power button it just turns right back on. Some of the buttons don’t work properly either.  Pressing the volume down button shuts the power off and still it turns back on automatically. It’s annoyingTo hear the startup sound and shut down sounds all day and night as it turns itself on and off automatically.,2022,03
Great sound and battery life lasts 4 ever,2022,02
"My husband and I now have 4 JBL speakers and love them! We have a huge home and our business on the property too, so we use them every where and any where we are. Easy to connect, great sound quality and wide blue tooth connection. We can connect to our computer, lap top, tablet, phone, TV and even in our car. They have a great color selection too. I highly recommend this product!",2022,03
Sounds great and plays for a long time.  Easy setup too.,2022,03
"Very difficult to turn on takes hours of trying,  then won't shut off or keeps coming back on itself after shut off",2022,03
"This thing is Awesome, the range for the Bluetooth is way far better than anything I've had before. I mean I got over 150' clear line of site and it was still crystal clear. Would highly recommend!!",2022,03
Worse sound than the Charge 3.,2022,03
Excelente bocina,2022,03
"I've bought 3 JBL charge 4 speakers over the past 3+ years (and one Flip 5 which is sort of still working) and the first two, after admitted heavy, daily use, just stopped working.  As the item is not easily opened (by design) or repaired, I don't feel there is any option other than buying other one for $130 USD.  anyone have any luck getting them repaired after they die?",2022,03
Awesome,2022,03
Just received it yesterday but have already been using it to listen to music out in the patio. The music is so crisp! I still need to adjust the settings on my phone to make sure i get my moneys worth with quality. I have yet to test the range but was about 15’ away with a wall in between and music was still going.,2022,03
"Perfect for listening anywhere. Portability, great sound and plenty of volume. Nice upgrade from original Flip and Charge 2 enjoyed immensely for last few years.",2022,03
Absolutely ridiculous watching the side panels go off with all this bass(bass is okay 6 out of 10) and everything else sound like it's inside a tin can. Mono Speaker ruins this product horribly.,2022,03
"The sound is awesome and has a very good bass.  What I like most is that it is rechargeable by a USB-C connection, and it is small enough to carry inside a small backpack. Nevertheless, the sound is loud enough to be heard across 600 sq ft apartment or more and between walls.  Great speaker for the money!",2022,03
"You never know when you buy something you’ve never used before but this speaker is great. Bluetooth connects quickly, sound is GREAT and it plenty loud enough. I set it on my freezer in the back of the garage and it’s plenty loud enough and crisp.",2022,03
Does not disappoint,2022,03
"good speaker, pretty good battery and overall, good for its price",2022,03
Love this speaker,2022,03
I was happy to get the gift from my sister.  Sound quality was great when I tried it out.  Before putting it to full use on my patio. I wanted to fully charge the speaker.  Guess what?  No USB charging cord in the packaging (nor any set up documentation).  Found some on-line but it was quickly apparent that my USB cords for my iPhone would not work to charge the device.  I had to order (what hopefully will fit) a replacement from Amazon.  Extremely disappointed with bothAmazon and the seller! 😡😡😡,2022,03
It’s amazing. I’m so glad I treated myself to this speaker.,2022,03
I listen to music none stop all day everyday I’ve bought tons of different Bluetooth speakers. Jbl is the best by far. Some would say they are over priced but if you can’t get that same sound quality and battery life plus durability out of something cheaper what’s the point your just robbing yourself. Get the good stuff,2022,03
I bought this speaker for our pool in our park! Its just enough to carry a great sound for everyone to enjoy,2022,03
"I like that now when you answer the phone it automatically takes your call off speaker to allow for private conversation. On the older models it would blast right through the speakers, and you'd have to scramble for head phones or run to turn off the JBL speaker.  Thank God I don't have to do that anymore! However, I do wish that it was optional, for only the music to continue softly in the background, separate from phone conversations.  Wouldn't mind having a few more of these around the house, since I think they link together. Love the speakers, Great Sound. Very CONVENIENT for wherever and whenever !",2022,03
Mono not stereo..,2022,03
Such a nice product and at a great price.,2022,03
Great sound and color options. Battery life last between 10 and 11 hours. Definitely a brand I'll stick with,2022,03
Great sound with bass.  Battery last a very long time.,2022,03
My Sister was very happy with her present and loves the sound.,2022,03
Almost perfect sounds 👌,2022,03
"This is our 2nd one. The size, sound, ease of use, durability, and quality are outstanding!",2022,03
I had high expectations and it exceeded them all !,2022,03
Provides a good volume range.,2022,03
"Best BT speaker I’ve bought by far, easily connect, sound is very clear and the bass is jumping. Great buy",2022,02
Works great,2022,02
"I bought JBL Charge4 recently. It is excellently crafter, extremely durable, produces well rounded sounds for enhanced music experience. For normal people (frankly 99% of population with a budget of =<$150) I would recommend Charge series (3,4,5) speakers. I recently compared it with the shrill voiced Marshall Emberton (that I wanted to buy as I had heard so much about it) and Charge4 is a clear winner for normal “ears”.Durability, water performance, base, power, battery life, looks/color options, and most of all the music that JBL Charge4 produces is way more superior that Emberton.Similar to our routine lives - only ears and good judgement were used for comparison (no technical sensors were used for testing)I am not associated in any way with JBL or HK  or Marshall or any other music speaker brand.",2022,03
This is my second JBL charge.  I live the sound and the color is fun!,2022,03
Love my sound box!,2022,03
"This thing is awesome! It came charged when it was delivered, and I’ve used it pretty much daily in the classroom during the week. 5 weeks later it finally died. Sound quality is great, too! Well worth the money",2022,03
Out of the box I had to call support because it sounded like it was skipping. But after factory reset its working.  Was expecting deeper bass and higher highs. But All in all its a good speaker,2022,03
"Great speaker great sound for the size,Cold be a little louder",2022,03
"The JBL sounds good,  even when it is loud.  Bluetooth was quick and easy. The battery has not let me down.  I like its portability",2022,03
 It's sounds great... I really like it.. it's a good speaker for the money,2022,03
Quality is great,2022,03
Using this every Friday for background music at a community event. Good sound quality.,2022,03
The speaker performs exactly as expected. It has big sound for such a small device.,2022,03
"I was shocked at the great sound quality, ease of use and design of this speaker.  I don't know how I went this long without it!!",2022,03
"Connected quickly to my phone, will be my speaker for my long drive moving across 8 states. Love the battery life and the sound quality is good. I recommend!",2022,03
Was having a pool party and this speraker rolled in the pool and died right away sounds good boy is not watter proof!! Only had it for like 2 to 3 weeks,2022,03
This is the second one that stopped working within a year,2022,03
Choice of colors.  Drop it in a beach bag and head out for the day. Sturdy design  Good sound.,2022,03
So far so good! This speaker gets loud without distortion. I love it and the color so much. I also like that it can charge my phone. It’s convenient because my area is often plagued by wind storms and power outages. I’m sure I’ll be using it for that soon enough. It was super easy to connect. I haven’t had any issues with the bluetooth connectivity. The battery life is very good.,2022,03
Did not like the sound quality. Did not like the app that was suppose to improve the quality of sound,2022,02
Sound quality is far superior than others. Bluetooth and connectivity is excellent. highly recommend!!,2022,02
"I've only had the speaker since February, it's already crackling. I use it in my work office, it's never up loud and it's already blowing? Not happy at all.",2022,02
"Good sound,  so far very happy with this purchase 😀",2022,02
"after i turn it off , randomly turns on by itself.",2022,02
"I love this product! I use it everyday.  Great,great sound. I don't use any of my radios anymore. You would not believe the sound that comes out if this small speaker.",2022,02
The sound is not as good as the extreme model but it does sound better good for the money. Wished I had bought the Extreme though,2022,02
Nice,2022,02
bought this for my granddaughter (19) for Christmas in Nov. She has been using it for less than 90 days and it has critical issues with defective on/off function. Contacted the JBL help line and tried all the reset options they offered but they did not work. Will try to get a warrantee replacement from JBL.,2022,02
I am giving it 4 stars because it does cut in and out at times.,2022,02
"Great product, great sound, battery life is awesome. Only thing I regret is the color I picked. Should’ve went with a dark color due to the fact that body is fabric like. Got dirty really fast.",2022,02
"Would not recommend at all. It has not been holding a charge for us at all. The only way we get it to play is if we charge it fully and then leave it plugged in while it’s on. It also cuts out very frequently and we have my phone sometimes sitting right next to the speaker. The sounds quality when it works is good, but that’s only maybe 10% of the time…",2022,02
"I took my Charge 4 speaker camping with me and was really happy with how it sounded, and how easy it was to charge my phone with it. A buddy of mine had another JBL speaker, and we were able to connect them using the app and it was a game changer.  We had occasional spots where the music got garbled, but overall it was a great experience.",2022,02
Work,2022,02
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She listens to it for hours daily. Easy to connect. Long lasting battery. Cute color.,2022,02
So I got this for sitting by the fire at night with the family. Now I take it everywhere I need great sound. I’ve even used in place of my Bose speaker.I rate this a 10+,2022,02
5 outta 5,2022,02
Best bang for your buck.. literally,2022,02
The better bass sound,2022,02
Big sounds for a neat unitLove the designBattery seems to last foreverNowI listen to my Bible studies and southern gospel music while I work and I really can hear everything and enjoy the crisp clear words and soundsMy wife enjoys using it also 👍,2022,02
DO NOT BUY! Does not last for more than 8hrs on a full charge. Thought the first one was defective since its advertised 20hrs of battery life. Flat out lie!,2022,02
"Nothing, these speakers are as good as if not better than Bose speakers. For the price these speakers sound absolutely amazing. Other than saying I’m very happy with my decision to buy these speakers. For the quality sound and price people I highly recommend you run out and buy yourself JBL HARMAN SPEAKERS. I bought two for myself one for my boat,(by the way the other morning I was fishing listening to my favorite Pink Floyd’s Dark side of the moon. While inside this little cove the sound just exploded it was like the acoustics was all around me. People just one little speaker sitting on the console of my boat. Sounded like I had a thousand dollar set up. For the money I highly recommend this little Gem, I promise you won’t be disappointed.",2022,02
"Truly impressive sound and battery life. I bought one a while back, and bought this one for my son who just just got married and bought his first house. He loves it (and her!).",2022,02
Great sound,2022,02
Listening to podcasts,2022,02
I love the color. I love the sound. It’s easy to synch up !!,2022,02
Always love jbl products,2022,02
"I placed the device on a shelf and kept it there after opening. After 4 days of use for about 30 minutes each day, without any disturbance, the sound all of a sudden started to crackle. All mid and low range frequencies were gone. I performed hard reset multiple times per the instructions without any change.",2022,02
"I have a charge and a flip. We have taken these everywhere. I know the charge has been thrown, tossed and dropped. The throw slightly opened the case but it snapped right back together and sounds as good as when we got it. I love these things. Great sound and great battery life.",2022,02
Pretty ..didn't work,2022,02
I always loved JBL products they have amazing sound quality for their price point. When I ordered it I was nervous cause I always like to test speakers out in store before ordering it but I could this time. It was a gift for my partner and I was definitely not disappointed! The speaker isn’t to big and it definitely sounds amazing! Definitely recommend!,2022,02
This small speaker is very impressive. Sound quality is amazing for a small speaker!  Very much recommend it!,2022,02
"works wonderfully in almost any situation! loud when you want it to be, works in big noisy rooms for background music or even to flush those out!",2022,02
A++,2022,02
So I originally was introduced to JBL speakers when the Charge 2 first came out. Loved it and was immediately a fan and remain to be.Fast forward to 2021. I have been telling any and everyone I come across that when ever in question go with JBL so this last Christmas someone baught me the JBL flip 4 and I was just confused. The sound quality the base???? Even the Bluetooth connection would kick me off about every third song. Returned no problem. I only wanted a replacement anyway. Received the second one and again like the JBL look and feel was there but the sound quality especially the base was just lacking. I was disappointed thinking that the company just dived after the Charge 2. So after getting refund from the second flip 4 spent I think it was an extra 20 25 dollar's?And there it was the sound that made me a fan to begin with. If you're just trying out JBL speakers I would recommend spending just the few extra dollars for the Charge models. I see that the flip 4 and 5 have almost a perfect rating on Amazon so maybe it's just my opinion but I believe the quantity all around of the Charge is a better representative of the JBL brand.The battery in the Charge seems to drain quicker than the Flip but I put my speaker threw it's passes from the moment I turn it on in the morning. Until I am ready to relax in the evening. I literally have nothing negative to say about the Bluetooth connection. No problem's at all. The sound quality is just awesome. I love music period I believe music is the best and purist way to control moods mentally emotionally spiritually and even physically. I listen to anything from gospel to heavy metal blues country rap etc. I have noticed that if the music being listened to is heavy in Base the lyrics will be more clear if you just lower the volume maybe 2 or 3 pushes of the button. If you're listening to sax or blues guitar??!! Albert King for example it only gets better the higher you go. Garth Brooks or Lauren Daigle just over half way of volume and the vocals and piano will be front and center and so on. Even at just little more than half way more than what you would need in the back patio or yard. Man I can't wait till I can get enough for the Extreme or the Boom Box. Hope this was helpful to someone. God Bless,2022,02
We have this speaker in blue.  Great speaker!  Gift recipient wanted yellow.  Not even close.  Gold at best.  Maybe basketball orange.  Didn't go through the hassle of returning.,2022,02
"When I’m listening while doing chores, it needs to carry through every room and this speaker does the trick. Through dog barks and other household noises I can still hear the song or speaker.The only drawback is that the Bluetooth does not connect to other generations of JBL speakers. Threes connect only with other threes, fours connect only with fours… it would not have changed my particular purchase and circumstance but will affect my future purchases because I will match the system for linking.",2022,02
Its a jbl speaker what else can you expect. One of the best quality speakers out there.,2022,02
My Sony bluetooth speaker gave out. I replaced it with this unit and I love it. Good volume and bass. Good enough for my 70's and 80's rock and roll taste.,2022,02
The sound is horrible.  I wish I could return it.,2022,02
I like 👍 good sound,2022,02
We ride side by sides and sometimes it hard to hear the tunes… not a problem with the Charge 4.,2022,02
"I purchased a JBL 4 charge for my son for Christmas and was so impressed I purchased 1 for myself, we have used the JBL flip for years and loved those as well",2022,02
Sounds awesome. Easy to connect.,2022,02
"I decided to venture out to a different model since my previous model was the Amazon speakers which has lasted me up to the present time.  I would have preferred the 360 tall cylinder type to the one I bought,  but will take a while to adjust.Overall pleased with the purchase. 👍",2022,02
Works absinthe in lap top and just to play at work,2022,02
Maybe I had a crazy expectation for this but I just feel like it’s not loud there’s no bass at all. Probably going to return it. Find something a little bit better.,2022,02
I love this! Worth this money!,2022,02
"It was a present, but feedback is that the sound is excellent",2022,01
"I love this speaker, I always use it and its amazing.",2022,01
"We had one of these that we used so often we wore it out. So, we bought another and the sound is even better than the last one. Very pleased with our purchase!",2022,01
 Save your money! What a cheap speaker.,2022,01
I love this!,2022,01
It meets my need !,2022,01
I returned it. Sounded like a bad day on AM radio.Did not keep it long enough to test battery life. Returned it the next day.,2022,01
I’m got this for Christmas and had no idea what I was missing with a prior BT speaker.. this has changed it all for me !!! Love love love it,2022,01
"Love everything about the speaker, wish it came with a bag to make it easy to take with me on trips.",2022,01
Great sound quality and bass. Very durable and I like the more rugged look.,2022,01
i use it for my daily concerts in the showers haha. even on a low volume it’s still loud!,2022,01
"Love love love my speaker, I’ve been wanting one since I saw my brothers and heard how clear and loud the sound was🥰 definitely recommend",2022,01
"For JBL, I expected better sound. Spend a little more and get a better model.",2022,01
Great sound. Good bass. Can take a beating. Charge lasts me 3 days at 5 hours or so each day.,2022,01
Sounds great and is a very sturdy for those little accidents of fall a short distance. Definitely going to get a few more to pair it with.,2022,01
I bought this speaker for any social events I might attend and work. I work at a fast food place and we love to listen to music as we clean up the store after close. This speaker is perfect and actually loud especially for the size. I love this speaker to death.,2022,01
"I wish I would have read more reviews before purchasing. It is a decent little speaker, but it definitely has the ""monosound"" as people have described. Love the color.",2022,01
I own two charge3 speakers that are still working well with my android phone many years later.  I bought this charge4 for my mother who has just recently started using an iPhone.,2022,01
Perfect sound and quality for my little market.,2022,01
"I assumed this speaker would sound better than the jbl flip 4 that I have, but I'm not convinced as of yet. Maybe after listening to it for a while I'll change my mind 😌",2022,01
This little speaker bangs!!,2022,01
Great portable personal use item.,2022,01
Battery/ all of the abovePurchased this item as a Christmas gift for my .  My son complains of the speaker just shutting off and not turning back on. Defected product. Disappointed cause we are out of return window and he hasn’t had this speaker that long . Should not have issues would like a replacement .,2022,01
"Amazing little speaker! Clear highs, distinct mids, and solid enough low end to satisify most people! Build quality is impressive! Definitely worth the money for this awesome sounding, little work horse!I would recommend the JBL charge 4 without reservation!",2022,01
"Just wish it came with all the fixing but, still works well.",2022,01
This is my second speaker and I love it! Especially since you can connect two or more together to have music playing in every room at the same time,2022,01
The sound is good but it turns itself on and off all the time. Had to start keeping in the shed when I’m not using it. Weird.,2022,01
"Beautiful sound, Heavy Duty, Solid Body, very Happy with Purchase.",2022,01
The speaker is very loud & fills the room. Easily portable for any event; the charge holds for a long time. Makes a wonderful gift. My fiance absolutely loves it!,2022,01
The volume on this is lower than my flip 4. Big disappointment.,2022,01
This does not go loud at all was a Lil bummed.,2022,01
"JBL speakers are the best! I bought this speaker as a gift, and I own one too.",2022,01
The sound quality is not that good. I used it couple of time and felt like either it is faulty or it's just the sound quality of Charge 4 is not good.,2022,01
"I got the JBL Charge 4, and it's worth every penny!! I highly recommend this speaker. The sound quality is insane, I was blown away. I even tested it under water for 2 minutes and it's true, 100% waterproof. I can't say enough great things! JBL won me over!",2022,01
I had HBO products before always been satisfied,2022,01
Awesome works great 👍,2022,01
Fantastic sounding speaker with lots of volume!,2022,01
Delivery was great but I wish I knew it didn’t come with a charger.,2022,01
"Came fully charged out of the box. Used it 4 to 6 hours a day delivering mail and packages when time and the route allowed. Sound quality is great for a single speaker that is trying to be a stereo speaker. Would like to buy another to link them for stereo but I don't need that right now. Bought the silicone or rubber thingy that is its protective case. I recommend it for obvious reasons but it really helps keep the damage down if you are going to use it in a violent environment like a postal carrier's truck. Listening to XM or your playlists on your phone has very little effect on the battery. Used it to charge my phone once, not bad but your phone isn't gonna charge fast. All in all, I would buy another one. The sound quality is good enough to want to link 2 of them together and BTW, they are waterproof...to a limit...read the instructions. Not a fan of the app. Kinda useless unless you want to link 2 units or there is a soft/firm ware update.",2022,01
Great quality  sound.  Bluetooth connectivity is immediate without any delay or problems. I will us the speaker for a few days before I need to plug it in.,2022,01
Had my Charge 3 for about 4 years but it started to go dead a few hours after I charged it.I bought the Charge 4 over a month ago and listen to audio books on it every day...I've only had to charge it up once!Love this speaker 🔊!,2022,01
Top of the line speaker at a great price! Would absolutely buy again.,2022,01
it be sounding nice and shi,2022,01
Excelente,2022,01
It has excellent sound quality and I’m very pleased.,2022,01
Well worth it. Doesn't disappoint.,2022,01
Easy to use,2022,01
"Sound quality is very good, bass is pretty good over all I love this speaker",2022,01
Only thing I didn’t like was you have to buy your own charging plug.  Other than that it’s worth it. Dropped the speaker going down the river reached down pulled it out still playing music and have no problems with it.,2022,01
It was given as a gift because I already own one and she loves it!,2022,01
The connectivity is great and the sound is the bomb!,2022,01
"It’s perfect,",2022,01
Product didn’t work,2022,01
Speaker sounds great but now just cuts off after 9 months of use. Super annoying having to reconnect. Unfortunately I’m outside of the service window but hoping JBL will fix it.,2022,01
"Tiny body with great performance.Sound loud enough, deep enough.Slightly weak in high tones, but not a big problem.",2021,12
This was a big splurge for me and I am EVER SO GLAD I did it! Phenomenal sound quality. Life is better with great sound filing the room!,2021,12
The kids really love them.  The fact that they are waterproof is essential.I don't know enough features... so I can't detail that.  But I am considering getting one for myself.,2021,12
"So this Lil guy is the best. Super loud, super clean tone. The battery life is great, and the fact you can use it to charge a device while using it is also super rad.  Ridiculous product for the cost.",2021,12
Is awesome I love sounds..,2021,12
I have one of these and like it so much I bought one for my son.  Love it.  Great sound!,2021,12
Unit is OK but it is a mono speaker. The sound quality is just not there. My charge 2 sounds much better and trust me it has been used. It does state that this unit only has one speaker but it is worded that if you take a quick glance you would not catch it. It should be stated very clearly that this is a mono speaker unit not stereo like the rest of the charge models. It is an alright unit but had I known it was mono I would have picked a different model. JBL it would be in your best interest to discontinue the Charge 4. Then perhaps you would not get so many bad reviews.,2021,12
"JBL, as a company, never disappoints! The Charge 4 is a great example.  The sound quality is great, with deep bass, and the battery life is excellent.",2021,12
"Overall a great unit, easy sync up, great sound. Cannot comment on the battery life, haven't had it long enough.",2021,12
Excellent sound and battery life,2021,12
Great product and sound quality! JBL is well worth the $ compared to cheap alternatives.,2021,12
Super load and light fits in every bag worth every penny,2021,12
"I actually bought two large outdoor speakers for my husband for Christmas (for our lanai) and he wanted to return them for one of these. We have a second and we connected both to our TV and honestly, it created a really nice surround sound effect without wires. Great product! I also bought some for my nieces and nephews last Christmas and they were a hit!",2021,12
He likes it,2021,12
This speaker is super durable I have dropped it multiple time and it works just fine and it is super loud I RECOMMEND THIS SPEAKER,2021,12
It’s very nice to get something that does what they say it will be do. Very very impressed,2021,12
The speaker is easy to set up and use. It produces good sound at an attractive price.,2021,12
Got one as a gift and almost hate the one give me this garbage,2021,12
"Bought this for my son for Christmas and so far so good. Honestly it's 100 times better then what I expected. Sound, bass, and battery life is actually great. Very pleased with this purchase.",2021,12
"Sound quality is good. Bluetooth connection is as described, and it will sync to other JBL devices.",2021,12
Great speaker all around. This is the second one we have purchased.,2021,12
Im totally impressed with the sound of this JBL Speaker.  Its perfect for my shop and by the pool.  Setting it up was simple.  Definitely recommend!,2021,12
"I purchased this as a gift for my teenage grandson.  He loves it!  The sound is great.  He can connect via Bluetooth.  He has it connected to his Playstation, and sings in the shower with it.  My daughter's happy too because now that he has his own, he leaves hers alone.  Great gift for them both.",2021,12
This speaker has such good sound quality we have bought multiple ones for  family.,2021,12
"Best speaker I've ever put money into, that's worth it!!!",2021,12
Can listen to music all night long and into the next day without recharging.,2021,12
Absolutely love it,2021,12
I like it has a case to pack it up and go!,2021,12
Best quality speaker!,2021,12
Not enough adjustability through speaker ie: more/less bass or highs,2021,12
"I have no complaints. Great sound, full bass, and aesthetically pleasing. I don’t plan on using the waterproof capabilities, but definitely intend to use the power bank at some point.",2021,12
"I own 2 of these now, as I purchased the second specifically because JBL advertises that you can link up to something like 100 of these together to all play the same music. I wanted that for my backyard. While this speaker sounds great on its own, I found the process of connecting it my original JBL speaker to be very challenging and it keeps cutting in and out, very choppy.",2021,11
Entertainment. Wasn’t happy that it didn’t come with charger?,2021,11
"I bought two speakers when I connected them, they were disconnecting oh they were making noises I contacted the seller and he told me to do an update to the system I did it and it was the same I bought another two in case they were defective and it was the same problem I had to return all and my money was returned to me in two weeks it was not a good experience",2021,11
I received my speaker went to use it and it kept crackling so I had to send it back was not impressed with this product and then they wouldn't let me exchange it for a new one I had to get a refund,2021,11
"I have two JBL Charge 3s. Had for a year or more. I wanted to add more speakers, as I can ""hook up to"" 100 JBL speakers --> the best feature you can have for portable bluetooth speakers.Well, the newer Charge 4 speakers, I bought just now,  cannot communicate with the ""Connect +"" firmware/software,"" of my Charge 3s.Showstopper, for me.I guess I could go back and get some Charge 3s... of just look around for others.If I missed the * (asterisk) that said the 3s and 4s don't work together, I am sorry for this review.",2021,11
Very easy to connect to your device. Sounds is great with great bass. Gets very loud and is good for outdoor settings,2021,11
Love the sound quality. Use at work.,2021,11
Amazing quality the best Bluetooth speaker!!,2021,11
Finally hopped on the jbl chain and I do not regret it one bit!!,2021,11
We bought the JBL speaker for my Dad For Christmas. He loves listening to his music and now he really loves his music.,2021,11
"I got this one to upgrade from my Flip 4. I really really like it, the battery lasts longer, has great quality sound. I do notice that the speaker is clearly heard from whichever direction the front of the speaker is facing. It also has a fair distance in which the music can be heard, even at a lower volume.",2021,11
"fast shipping, great product as i expected",2021,11
"These are the best speakers. High quality, excellent sound, waterproof, can also connect with several other speakers (same type of course!) to creat surround sound. Highly recommended!",2021,11
"Can't believe I use to waste my money buying cheap portable speakers. This one is great; its loud, bass sounds amazing, and with 20 hours of battery life I can throw away my portable charger.",2021,11
We tested several similar speakers and this by far has the best overall sound with great bass. Extremely happy.,2021,11
"This little speaker has great sound. We use it by the pool all the time. While we haven't dropped it in the water, it has gotten splashed and has been fine.  Two years later and the battery still lasts 6 - 8 hours.",2021,11
"I just love this Bluetooth Speaker. I did a lot of research on different units and this one came out on top for me!! Great sound, battery life and looks!",2021,11
I purchased this for my 13 year old grandson and he loves it! He takes it everywhere with him! Great buy!,2021,11
Great sound for the value sounds like your at a live concert,2021,11
"I finally pulled the plug and purchased this speaker and received April 1, 2021.  The sound was just ok,  it didn’t cover the whole house as i would have loved.  The speaker when out October 2021, it didn’t even last a year.  I believe it was due to a shortage in the port.  I noticed earlier on, that the flap to hide the power ports pushed up against the cord while plugged, so my guess is that it finally got destroyed; this is very disappointing given the fact that it is still fairly new. Now I have to spend more money on a new speaker.  The next time I will go ahead and invest in the warranty!",2021,11
"We are listening to our speaker for a couple of weeks with one charge, at least one hour per day. The sound is great, clear, and may be loud if you want.",2021,11
Great speaker..bad order fillers. I ordered a black speaker and got a grey one. The rest of my JBL speakers are black and they are not letting the grey one play any Bluetooth speaker games.,2021,11
nothing,2021,10
love it works very well! gets pretty loud!,2021,10
"Just got this, so not sure how it will hold up over time. It was VERY well packaged .. could have drop-kicked it without damage. Arrived within stated range. The speaker was nearly fully charged, Charging was as easy as attaching a USB. Came with USB cable, but no adapter .. got plenty of those, so I'm actually happy about the non-duplication. Bluetooth pairing with my Android phone was quick and easy. Sound is a bit base heavy, but is rich and full, no buzz even when cranked, easily filling a 20x20 room. It looks well built and based on my inspection could probably withstand complete submersion. So far, I'm very happy. If it continues to perform well I will buy another one, or more, and link them for a more intense sound experience. The intended use of this speaker is a relatively humid wine cellar.",2021,10
Great gift.  Sound is great. Many Colors to chose from.  Definitely buy from them again,2021,10
"Note: I've owned these for over six months. I shopped for bluetooth speakers. Bose pricing is insane. JBL had the ""Charge 4"" & the ""Charge 5"" on Amazon. The ""Charge"" models seemed to be very similar based on the item description so I went with this Charge 4 b/c it was less expensive.  I'm glad I did!I don't use this often, but every time I do I'm surprised by the sound quality. Sounds great & the batteries last for a long time.Sometimes I have a bit of difficulty switching from MacBook streaming to iPhone streaming (or vice versa), but I'm sure it's operator error. Regardless, it can be done.  And I'm quite satisfied with the purchase. These are great by the pool in the summertime.",2021,10
"I gave this to my sweetie for Christmas two days ago. I got a call from him today telling me in detail how he had set it up and used his additional JBL Bluetooth speaker with it as well.He can be quite the critic, being an I.T. Manager😁,  but he could only say wonderful things about how easy it was operate and the quality of sound that was achieved with one small speaker.  Thank you JBL for making my gift to my guy a very special one.",2021,10
My son takes this with him where ever he goes.  The sound is great and the camo is a nice touch for a guy.,2021,10
This is my 3rd JBL that has a charger issue! Not cool. The charger outlet on the JBL always breaks then can’t charge it anymore.  Not worth purchasing this product.,2021,10
Loud enough for any home activity and kids parties in public pavilions.Can be connected to laptop (via Bluetooth) to get more volume and bass.,2021,10
Love it while it worked.  Great quality.  Suddenly stopped holding a charge (nothing happened to it).  Obviously could be coincidence that it happened right after warranty  Expiration but suspicious enough that I think I will buy a different brand in the future. After a good experience this one I had bought another 1 maybe 6 months ago and we'll have to see if that 1 lasts more than a year now too,2021,10
This product was well worth the money,2021,10
"I bought this and originally gave it a perfect review because the sound quality is great but the actual quality is not. After less than 90 days, it quit charging and quit working. I called Amazon who offered a refund. When I purchased it, it was $119. They told me they would refund me and then I could order a new one and now they are 149. When it worked, it works great. But it just did not last long on Amazon did not really do any favors with replacing. I’m sure the reason they did not replace it is because the price has gone up or the sale is over. I asked for a replacement and they told me no.  They gave me a refund and told me to re-order so that they instead so I’m sure they can make more money. Not happy and very unimpressed. I do not recommend buying the speaker through Amazon because Amazon seems to be the crappy one here. Go buy it at Costco who will honor the same price and replace it.",2021,10
Bought for granddaughter and she’s been playing music all day!  She loves it!,2021,10
"Sound quality is superb, definitely better than expected. JBL doesn’t disappoint.",2021,10
Best Bluetooth speaker yet,2021,10
Not a cheap speaker and I used it for less then 6 months and it just stops. Battery is full and it was a waste of maney,2021,10
I needed something that could take heavy rain. This made it overnight left out in a Costa Rica rain and was totally fine. Battery is good and I even started to use it for movies. Linking two together was easy and of course much better for movies,2021,10
The sound a bass i this is perfect for what I was looking for battery life is long and if you are use it and you forget too turn it off it will do it for you,2021,10
Shipped fast & is louder than other speakers I've bought.,2021,10
Not as loud as I was expecting for the price that I paid idk if there was something wrong with mine but it seems to loose connection to my iPhone 12 Pro Max after a few minutes,2021,10
"I've had this speaker for some time now, like 2 years. Today my wife and I drove from our house to the store about 1.5 miles away in the rain. Turning into the lot, I hear a rattle on top of the car, where I put my speaker when I was cleaning the garage and forgot about.So I whip into a space, freaking out that I lost/broke my speaker forever, but it was still on the car. (Jerking into the space made it fall though). Grabbed it, turned it on, connected, played great! This thing survived a fall off my car after driving 1.5 miles in the rain. No regrets for this purchase.",2021,10
These speakers are AMAZING and nothing short of that I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone even considering them.  We have 4 in our house and sync them together regularly to make the whole house able to hear clearly the music we stream.,2021,10
"That’s really good, quality and battery life",2021,10
"Use it a lot listening to music on social media. Sometimes can be a little muddy in sound, but that may be the audio system from the social media site. Otherwise, very satisfied. There may be larger brands out there at much cheaper prices than the JBL, advertising ""Strong Bass"". But the tonal quality of these cheaper speakers is not that great.",2021,10
It is all as discribed. Loaded with features,2021,10
"After 4 years of heavy use, one of the speakers finally blew. I've really put this thing through the ringer over the years, constantly getting it wet, dropping it off the back of the golf cart, listening to music with the volume at max constantly. This thing is a tank. I have yet to hear a portable bluetooth speaker that can come close to matching the volume output or the sound quality as the JBL.",2021,10
No charger cable how do I supposed to charge it,2021,10
There's nothing to dislike.,2021,10
No complaints love it loud and clear.,2021,10
I’ve had it for four months and the battery doesn’t work and won’t take a charge. Outside the return window of 30 days,2021,10
Never have to max out the volume and it has an amazing battery life. I LIKE TO WORKOUT ALMOST EVERYDAY! I DIDN'T HAVE TO CHARGE IT FOR CLOSE TO 2 WEEKS.,2021,10
"I bought it as a present for a family member but I seem to have adopted it. Sounds great, solid quality feel and look, Easy to connect and good range of connectivity.  I've only had it a month so I can't attest to longevity. I may have to buy another one for myself.",2021,10
Where is a charging cable? The one I bought 5 years ago had one. WTF? And the rechargeable battery only lasted 5 years and I didn't use it that much. But they do have good sound quality,2021,10
Great base and sound !JBL best quality !,2021,09
Takes a long time to charge,2021,09
Can't go wrong with this,2021,09
Terrible sound. No bass! I return it,2021,09
"I has purchased charge 3s in the past, great.  The 2 charge 4s will not hold a “charge”.  I have followed online instructions to no avail.  Charge engineers s/b fired, one and all.  Complete FAIL.  Recommend you follow my advice and never purchase a charge speaker.  You will only have yourself to blame.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.",2021,09
"JBL Charge 4! What a trooper. Went through the window, bent the metal frame, and not a scratch! Wish windows were this durable and girlfriends were more sane! Definitely sticking with JBL!",2021,09
" Alright first of all the reason I'm here writing this is I lost one of these off the bed of my truck at about 25mph on an asphalt road. It dropped rolled and bounced into the ditch and I found it a few hours later. (see video) now first thing I thought was this thing's toast. Nope! Not this speaker! Dang thing fires right up and goes right back to playing solid sounds! I love these speakers, I have since day one. I'm here after a year of pretty consistent use to say I still love these speakers. Battery life is great for the sound they put out. The connectivity option to listen with multiple at one time is the reason I bought them and I love that. 10/10 would buy again! Jbl or bust in my book.",2021,09
This thing almost Caught Fire !!! Melted port and cable!Now I could have got a dud I get it but this is unacceptable period.I even contacted there customer support and what a joke. they did not take it serious at all. pretended to transfer me to another dept and hung up on me.Please buy something else!,2021,09
Great product,2021,09
"Sounds great, I purchased the Flip 4 a couple years ago and wanted more sound quality. This thing is awesome!",2021,09
My sister and I both have these speakers and we think they are great. We live in the country so radio is difficult. We bluetooth online music.,2021,09
Battery life is great sound is clear and loud!,2021,09
"i ride my bike to work and next to busy traffic it sounds great at 60% - 70% volume, indoors its even better with crisp highs and really good lows",2021,09
Classic JBL speaker can’t go wrong. also a beautiful color,2021,09
This purchase bangs more for your buck!!!!,2021,09
"I bought one to use outdoor around my pool and loved it so much I got  a second second one to use in stereo mode. Battery life is incredible and lasted over a week with 4 or5 2 hour swims.  The fact that they are weather resistant is a big plus as mine have both been splashed quite a bit. I put 1 under the diving board on 1 end to keep it out of direct sunlight and heat and the other one is at the opposite end of the pool under a pool chair. These have bass, crisp highs, and they will really crank up the volume but I don't annoy my neighbors. Takes less than 2 minutes to turn on and connect to eithet my phone or tablet. The tablet option is nice on a stand if I want to watch a football game while taking a swim. 5 star HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",2021,09
Gets loud enough to hear outside in the yard.Crisp sound.Great sound.,2021,09
Very nice quality both in sound and rugged design/construction.  Big sound even in a large room.  Battery lasts a long time.  Easy Bluetooth connection to my iPhone works every time with no hassle.  Typical Bluetooth range.  Its fine as long as the phone and speaker are in the same room.  Almost all Bluetooth things are that way unless they have a stick antenna and cost a lot.,2021,09
"This bluetooth speaker is better than expected.Sound quality, battery is very good.It beats the competition.Very happy with this speaker.",2021,09
Sound is amazing and design is beautiful.,2021,09
There is no audible warning when the battery is low. The indicator lights are at the bottom of the speaker. The way you know is when the speaker turns off in the middle of the night and you fumble with the charger while the speaker keeps turning off until the battery gets a charge. Sound quality is nothing special considering the price and the JBL brand.,2021,09
JBL speakers have been great… this is my third.,2021,09
Someone borrowed my last one and it was lost.  I bought the same model and just as pleased,2021,09
Great sound and battery life!  Also love that you can charge a mobile device with it!!,2021,08
"This speaker was a little larger than anticpated, but it is great. It was easy to connect to and easy to use.",2021,08
"If you're looking for a portable speaker for casual outings or at home, I'd say this is a great purchase. If you're someone like me who works in the kitchen from 8-9 hours, this speaker probably isn't worth it with it's battery life. I kinda expected it, but I didn't even have it on max, and it ran out on my 7th hour, which was actually almost over an hour off from my other speaker I still had. Pretty large for something that looks like it would have longer charge, but that's kinda my only gripe. At least it sounds nice.",2021,08
Got on prime day and super happy!!! Best deal ever!,2021,08
My son brought his speaker over to listen to while he did some outdoor work for me. After I listened I had to get one for myself.,2021,08
This speaker sounds great as long as it is in the same room as your music source. The sound counts in and out as soon as you walk around a corner.,2021,08
Great sound I new it was a good plan to buy thanks so much,2021,08
Arrived the next day and the sound is great.,2021,08
I love the speaker it's great. The sound is great. I'm upset I didn't order it sooner.,2021,08
Sounds good perfect for my fishing boat,2021,08
I like it. I  Recommend 100%,2021,08
I love my new JBL Speakers. The sound is very clear and you can connect more than one at a time. That is a great improvement over the older speakers. I wish I could trade my older ones in for these new ones!,2021,08
"Awesome out of the box-excellent sound qualityBut Longevity is major issue -I never dropped , heated, or abused unit in any way -used charging cable and followed chargingh directionsBUT the unit now doesnt charge anymorethis is a defect in build quality - its not acceptable to fail this early",2021,08
Stand need wider base it likes to roll around while I drive car stereo took a crap,2021,08
"This speaker was great while it still worked. I kept it primarily in the same spot, used it maybe 30 minutes a day, was never rough with it, and one day it just died on me. Doesn't charge, doesn't power on. I've owned $20 Bluetooth speakers that lasted me years and still work, but this was a complete waste of money.",2021,08
Easy to set up and the sound is amazing!,2021,08
"Sounds good, Battery doesn't last as long as advvertised!",2021,08
Amazing speaker. Sound is awesome & the battery goes forever.,2021,08
I liked it and so I bought another one and then the first one died a month after the warranty ended.  I don't trust the product anymore and will be returning the second one because I'm still in the return window.,2021,08
I bought I bought it as a gift for my husband but I use it sometimes. it’s not too loud. Very portable he loved that we take it to the beach with us every time we go. Easily connects to bluetooth. The battery last a very good while.My only dislike was that when I vacuum I doesn’t play loud enough to hear it over the noise of my vacuum.,2021,08
Very nice for listening to my YouTube songs out in the yard!,2021,08
Thought I was buying the good loud one.. not as much volume as I'd like on the beach.,2021,08
"I am a senior citizen and have always considered Bose the standard in speakers, but this product exceeded my expectations. I got it refurbished and so it was a great bargain. Works great.",2021,08
"This is a large speaker, I read the dimensions but its significantly larger than the Flip series. my only criticism would be that it does not really have a ""quiet"" setting, even the lowest it can go is still sometimes a little louder than wanted. That being said, it sounds great, can be very loud, and we haven't had any issues yet.",2021,08
This speaker has plenty of sound while I’m in my boat.,2021,08
I love the quality of the sound.  The device is easy to set up and it pumps out great bass and treble.  My house has concrete walls throughout the house so I can't use it beyond line of sight of my laptop. I would definitely recommend this,2021,08
Hopefully they will do the right thing.,2021,08
"I bought this about 15 months ago and it worked perfect.  In the course of normal use I turned it off and then went to plug it in immediately after.  I noticed the unit wouldnt charge and proceeded to try several other chargers to no avail.Since product is slightly more than 1 year old, JBL is offering to give me the names of local repair shops that I can pay out of pocket to fix this.  Shoddy workmanship for a premium product that is more than likely designed to break after warranty so you'll have to buy another.I just dont get how it can work.... and after turning if off while working... it would proceed to NEVER turn on again.  IF you want to throw away $150 every year then this is the perfect speaker for you.  I was offered a 30% discount on a future speaker but that is not the answer I wanted or expected.",2021,08
"The sound is awesomely fantastic! JBL is worth every penny.The bass is beautiful! The battery is long lasting.I can charge it to full and I don't hav to charge it again for another 3,4 days sometimes longer.JBL is a great product! I tried other Bluetooth speakers.Always go bak to JBL.No comparison!",2021,08
stop working one after purchased.  no help from amazon to replace.,2021,08
"I have always loved JBL products, and this speaker doesn’t disappoint whatsoever. For a portable Bluetooth speaker, this thing BUMPS! Like can hear it all over a 3 bed/2 bath house. For an apartment, your neighbors might get mad if it’s too high. The battery life is really good, with many hours of use even at higher volume levels which drains the battery much faster. The sound quality is awesome, with great bass and clarity. Bluetooth connection is quick and easy, and you can go pretty far away with your phone in your pocket, and it won’t skip a beat. And of course it’s called the Charge cuz you can charge other electronic devices with the 5W USB charging plus. That’s a dope addition to an already great speaker. Finally, the value for the money spent to purchase this, and it’s DEFINITELY worth it’d price and then some. The Charge 5 is $179.99, and I got this Charge 4 open box brand new for $109.99. That’s an insane deal, thanks to Amazon haha. My favorite Bluetooth speaker of all time!!! 10/10",2021,08
Great sound quality and volume.,2021,08
The volume is as high as the JBL Flip 4 it looks bigger but it’s not as high.It was a huge disappointment what’s the point of it being bulky if the sound is not high.Stick to the flip cheaper and sounds exactly the same.,2021,08
Unfortunately I am lucky to get 8 hours out of the speaker. I was sure I wouldn't get the full rated hours but really figured I would get more than 8. Otherwise a great speaker.,2021,07
"The sound quality is perfect, bluetooth and the battery it last long.",2021,07
Highly recommend. Can’t believe I waited so long to get one of these. It’s a game changer when listening to music - great quality.,2021,07
I use this speaker on my pool deck. Great sound!,2021,07
Love this speaker. Very easy to set up and use. Great sound quality. Battery lasts forever!,2021,07
"Super quality sound, perfect for relaxing and enjoying music in the confines of home. Great value for money.",2021,07
We use this as our portable backyard / poolside speaker. It produces a surprisingly high volume and sound quality out of such a small package. Very happy with the purchase!,2021,07
"Dad's a bit deaf, and had Bose stuff in the past. He asked me to order him a Bose version of this. After some research, I bought this instead (JBL Charge 4). Dad loves it. It works great and plays loud. Sound quality is better than I would have expected from a small speaker, but it's a MONO speaker... so not exactly highfi, and it's in NO way a reference monitor. For what it is, it's great!",2021,07
Product is useless without a charge.,2021,07
I used this for road trips and it sounds too good.,2021,07
"I took it to the beach, no problem with the sand, great sound.",2021,07
All around best in it's class.,2021,07
"Battery lasts a long time. Once you connect it by Bluetooth, it connects automatically after. Sounds great even outside.",2021,07
I was totally amazed by this little speaker!,2021,07
Good sound quality and decent range.,2021,07
It's very versatile. I really like it a lot,2021,07
"I’ve had two JBL speakers over the last 7 years and I use the frequently. I treat them well, don’t drop them, get them soaked or anything like that. All that being said, the battery either dies or it will no longer get loud. I’m moving on to another brand.",2021,07
Everyone should be mentioning the radiation this speaker is emitting.  Keep it at least two feet away.  DON’T CARRY IT AROUND.  It emits high radiation even when it’s off!,2021,07
Amazing Speaker with even better connectivity!!! Only complaint is sound is not too crisp or loud. Overall Amazing speaker and would recommend to buy!!,2021,07
"The speakers sound amazing and the two that I purchased immediately paired using the JBL Connect App. My only concern is that neither charging door closes tightly or seals shut, which makes me believe that they wouldn't be waterproof since water or liquids would easily enter the USB ports.",2021,07
"For its size it pounds out the music with surprising clairity and volume. Bass is astounding for its size.Perfect size for on the go with bikes, side by sides, camping and not to mention water use on the boat or beach with being water resistant.Solid science behind this unit.Worth every penny.",2021,07
Sound quality less than advertised.  Buy something else.,2021,07
"Happy with the sound, quality",2021,07
"My husband is very picky about his speakers, and I got this as a surprise for him. He's absolutely in love! JBL has some of the best speakers. This is the third one in my family now. Thanks!",2021,07
First let me say that this JBL portable speaker isn't a toy.This has weight to back up the power sound it brings.So if your looking to bring your party anywhere this speaker will bring it.It's also waterproof. But I don't recommend anyone taking there party to the shower.Sound check!,2021,07
"My neighbor had this version of Bluetooth speaker, and bought one for myself to listen to tunes while sitting at my desk. My coworkers love how it sounds, it’s reception range, the clarity without any distortion and it motivated one coworker to buy one for himself. The battery stays charged for quite a long time. I honestly can’t remember when I charged it last, but it was over 2 weeks ago. This is an item that doesn’t disappoint.",2021,07
"Love JBL products; their sound quality is awesome. The bass is decent for a Bluetooth speaker, better than most I’ve heard. Gets nice and loud too, and battery holds up for quite a while! Very happy with this one.",2021,07
"We have had STEREO technology since at least the early sixties.This unit? By itself?MONO!I should have combed through the reviews and searched online.HINT: I should not have to.I would have given it ONE star for not being stereo capable, but I assumed some of the responsibility.",2021,07
These speakers are great!! The bass sounds wonderful,2021,07
Speaker crackles and can't hear music clear.,2021,07
I did know !! Fast delivery,2021,07
"Bigger than other speakers we have had, but that is a plus. Choice of colors was an added plus since everyone has black or white it seems",2021,07
Much better sound than phone.  Listening to tunes while golfing,2021,07
Just great sound from this speaker.  Pretty durable and water resistant too.  A great purchase.,2021,07
I suggest this speaker it’s like a surround sound system!,2021,07
"I had an older, smaller JBL and the battery stopped holding a charge.  I upgraded it to this larger unit.  The sound is great and the larger battery lasts a long time.  It will run out faster if you are also charging your phone while using it but that's a fair tradeoff.  The bluetooth connectivity is flawless.",2021,07
I love this I can have stereo quality music Anywhere! The charger lasts a long time. So thrilled with JBL Charge 4..you will be too. I recommend buying the carrying case also.,2021,07
The speaker was for my husband's motorcycle he's able to put it on his motorcycle ride with it. Bluetooth connection real easy for him the sound of the speakers very loud  he's very happy with it's easy for him to set up and he was able to charge it without taking it off his motorcycle so that's even better plus it's waterproof he loves it and we will definitely buy it again two thumbs up,2021,07
All I can say is that I use it a lot.  This is going to sound stupid but I really don't remember the last time I charged it.  I mean I don't use it everyday but at least 2 to 3 tines a week for at least a couple of hours.  Sometimes I bring it in my garage as I am working on a project so it will be on for 3 to 4 hours.  It still shows 3 lights for charge.  Just told the wife the other night as we were listening to it on the deck that I cant believe it still has a charge.,2021,07
My niece brought this unit to my house for a camp out and I was so impressed with it that I bought one the next day.,2021,07
Perfect. Beat purchase I have made this year.,2021,07
All good!,2021,07
Batteries are not staying charged longer than 1.5 - 3 hours.,2021,07
"I thought the sound was going to be louder than the old model but not so I decided to return it, it’s too expensive!",2021,07
This little speaker has great bass and all around good deal.,2021,07
Would recommend!,2021,07
This speaker is great if you want a big boom out of a smallish speaker. This is a big step up from the flip 4 with how loud it gets. The battery life is amazing and stays alive for a long time.,2021,07
Love it,2021,07
"Sounds awesome, connects right away, no complaints",2021,07
"I like the sound, the power button is hard to push it..",2021,07
"Great speaker,great sound,long lasting battery life.",2021,07
Speakers have trouble connecting to Bluetooth.  Tried resetting and still get distorted sound when connecting to stereo mode thru the JBL app. The sound is good and I am sure the battery life is fantastic.  Possible got a bad set? Box appeared to have been previously opened.  Sending back and getting a replacement.,2021,06
Battery life is amazing you won’t regret it,2021,06
It’s a great speaker would recommend,2021,06
So easy to pair. Sound is excellent,2021,06
"I just got it today and immediately paried my phone to it to listen to music and was very impressed with the bass sound and how clear the sound was. It's a little bigger than my sister's JBL Flip 4, and in my opinion I think it packs a bigger punch when it comes to sound and bass.",2021,06
Works wonders!,2021,06
Sound quality is a little muddy. Other than that its a great speaker for the size.,2021,06
This item was returned. The one time it worked it was awsome.,2021,06
"My son has  this exact same speaker and we were so impressed we ordered one for ourselves. Great sound, great quality & reasonable price.",2021,06
This thing last forever and the sound is fabulous for music or a movie!,2021,06
So far it sounds great.,2021,06
"Great sound, great price.",2021,06
"This is a outstanding product use it all the time very good volume and bass, i take it the beach, park recommand for amazon customers to buy. Battery life is excellent. Had no issue connecting with bluetooth.",2021,06
Great product,2021,06
"Quick, easy set up, and great sound.",2021,06
"Bought this to replace my destroyed JBL Flip 4Sound quality is awful compared to the flip 4.Also the flip 4 had a lanyard attachment to hang it which you can't with the charge.And the charge function takes 6 hours to charge my Samsung S9.Overall, save your money and get the flip, its less expensive, louder, better quality",2021,06
"Sounds great,  easy to connect.",2021,06
I like the product but why did I get another charge of 15 dollars and one cent the next day please explain,2021,06
Bluetooth connection very fast.,2021,06
"Not waterproof , started to sound fuzzy after 2 months of using it. Great if it’s going to be indoors and not in extreme conditions.",2021,06
perfect to bring anywhere and has amazing sound quality!!,2021,06
Awesome,2021,06
"This is great! the JBL Charge4 sounds fantastic with a clear crisp sound and bass that will keep even the hardiest rockers or R&B listeners quite happy. And it lasts forever on a full charge (we’ll, not literally but longer than any other chargeable device I have ever owned). It won’t die in the middle of your beach party. Four thumbs up from this music lover.",2021,06
"I only got around 10 hours on a full charge, but this was using the Bluetooth and at max volume. For such a small device the sound is better than I expected.",2021,06
Bought for a family member!  And SHE LOVES IT! THANKS JBL!,2021,06
"Puts out incredible sound quality, durable and actually very vey water proof (full dunk on may occasions). Every other blue tooth speaker sounds like crap compared to this one. Can’t and won’t live without it!",2021,06
"I've read a lot of the ""One Star"" reviews and have to say MY experience is far, far, different.  Following are a few tidbits from my use of these JBL C4 speakers:1)  I have purchased SEVEN  (7) of these from Amazon - five for my daughter and her family and I own two myself.2)  The EQ is controlled from the PLAYER you have connected to these speakers...NOT by the speaker.  I have cycled thru the EQ on my MP3 player and the JBL C4 picks them all up.3)  NO - there is NO separate charge cord...READ the AD - it  says exactly that.  Don't act surprised when you open the box = NO Wall Charger - just a USB cord for charging.4) TRUE stereo separation (for all you audiophiles out there) requires a MINIMUM of three to six feet of speaker separation with home stereos...not likely to be achieved by ANY speaker small as JBL C4 - but a big fat SO WHAT?  I use mine in the shower - put it on a ledge and WOW - wonderful sound quality with more volume than I ever need.5)  QUALITY COSTS MONEY!  You will ALWAYS get what you pay for - go cheap = get cheap.  If you go to the Vendor list and grab the cheapest one out there, don't be surprised when you get a ""look-alike"" which in NOT made by JBL.6) Hooking up a number of these speakers and spreading them around the room may sound as if the signal was getting to some slower than others, appearing to be a ""LAG.""  ALL of the speakers are getting the SIGNAL at exactly the same time...what you are experiencing is the audio output ""DOPPLER"" effect (I'll let you look that definition up by yourself).  So - space the speakers closer to each other.7) Battery life - you WILL  experience a great deal of battery life IF you keep the volume down to a reasonable level.  Crank it up to full blown PARTY TIME and it will eat up battery power.I truly hope my comments help to answer some of the questions posed about the JBL C4 speaker.  NO - I do not work for Amazon or JBL.  I am simply a USER wishing to put light on some misunderstandings.  John",2021,06
"i just spent a lot of money on this little thing and a couple months later, it won't stay on.I go to return it but amazon account tells me it was only a 1 month warranty.  That pathetic if that's true.",2021,06
"This product is great, I’ll have to but a 2nd unit to have more sound throughout the beach house.",2021,06
The best,2021,06
Excellent Product and works well,2021,06
Im in love with this speakers. I have purchased three already and i love them.,2021,06
Definitely recommend this Bluetooth speaker. Connects quick and great sound,2021,05
Awesome sound and BASS,2021,05
"After 7 months the JBL Charge 4 will no longer take a charge. This is a pretty frustrating issue as it’s a new device we’ve only used a handful of times.There are a lot of articles about it online, but fixing it is difficult for someone who’s not familiar w electronics and there’s a lot of trouble shooting involved.",2021,06
Great sound! Light and stylish. Highly recommend!,2021,06
Sound quality is as advertised. Battery life is exceptional. I feel good about this purchase.,2021,06
We love this speaker and use it daily at the pool. The sound is awesome and hard to believe from such a small speaker!,2021,06
This is a great Bluetooth speaker.  I love JBL and this little speaker did not disappoint.,2021,06
My father has one JBL just like this one that I love and that's why I bought. I guess I wasn't lucky with my JBL because it won't charge. I am waiting for the seller to contact me. I still want a JBL but one that works,2021,06
My speaker won't turn on. It's dead and useless. Such a disappointment.,2021,06
The best out of all of my speakers. Take it everywhere. 20 hours of play,2021,06
"I love this speaker. I mainly use it in my garage gym so I can listen to music but still hear my baby monitor if my kid wakes up during his nap. It's easier than using headphones. I never have to have it up to full volume to get what I want out of it. It has a good range and it's easy to use and pair with your phone. We also use it at our fire pit and seems durable. Great battery life, I use it a lot and rarely charge it. When I do, it charges fast.  It's gotten some ash on it but nothing is affected. Super happy. Hope to have it a long time.",2021,06
The sound and connectivity are great!  And the ability to charge my other devices makes it the perfect travel companion.,2021,06
"I love this speaker! Great sound, super durable and long lasting.",2021,06
"Expected to have more volume, better frequency range.",2021,06
Sounds great. Pairs easy. Long play time.,2021,06
"Sound quality,bluetooth connectivity. I use a lot at the beach.",2021,06
Sound quality is really goodIt connects to bluetooth fast and easy and i love the battery life it last a long time,2021,06
JBL makes the best BT speakers hands down. There’s no competition. I’ll be buying another to pair them both,2021,06
"Big sound, long battery life, stylish, we got the aqua blue color.  Throw this speaker in your beach bag, backpack, purse, you'll enjoy awesome sound anywhere you go.  Music makes everything better!  Great purchase! 10/10",2021,06
Very good,2021,06
Great sound super portable and lasts a long time!,2021,06
Back yard parties are enhanced with the music from this speaker.,2021,06
I love it. It works great,2021,06
I use this speaker around the house and I love it!. The sound and the quality is excellent. This speaker was everything I expected it to be.,2021,06
Another solid product from JBL I’ve seen a lot of reviews complain about the sound quality… let’s be real for an item that can be fully submerged and still have the same great sound it did before it got wet its good bang for your buck it was more then loud enough for my back yard. Are you going feel like your at a concert? No. Are you going to be able to hear the song played while swimming? Yes.,2021,06
Loved it so much we bought two,2021,06
"Easy to pair with phone, computer, etc. Great sound quality and size.",2021,06
"I actually love this speaker. It's easy to clean off the sand if you take it to the beach/lake, you can listen to it for hours (I just have had it on for over 7 hours now as I'm listening through the night), charges fast, the sound is amazing!!! Perfect to set the mood or party it out!",2021,06
"Great quality, value, look, sound.",2021,06
"Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he always has it with him. In the car that doesn't have Bluetooth, in the garage, at the pool. This is probably the best gift I have ever given. The sound is very good and the battery life lasts a good long time.",2021,06
My only concern is the volume adjustment does not work in small enough increments.,2021,06
The battery life is pretty bad,2021,06
I like because the battery long life more than 6 hrs,2021,06
"Great they have a crisp and clear sound, but for stereo sound you should have two.",2021,06
"For only a few dollars over $100, this works great and the sound is very good.",2021,05
Everything I wanted.,2021,05
Excelente quality sound and battery life.,2021,05
Sound quality is great and so is battery.,2021,05
2 months and already not holding a charge. My JBL 3 had same issue but after 2 yrs! Not 2 months! Very frustrating,2021,05
Sounds so good. Plays for hours on single charge,2021,05
"This thing is terrific. It has a shocking amount of bass for a small speaker.  JBL pretty much nailed the design.  If I were to complain it would be that the base is a little narrow.  I use the speaker by my pool and I dont want to bump the speaker and it roll into the pool (again.. :-) )For you people that are complaining about it being mono - Its an engineering choice to deliver performance in other areas.  Do you have to have stereo drivers that will be 8 inches apart?  Is that REALLY needed? Of course not.. If that bothers you, there are a ton of other devices that might be a better fit, but I doubt it will deliver as well in the other areas.  I have an old BT stereo speaker and it does not come close to delivering sound on par with the Charge 4.Going mono delivers more volume, longer battery, lower heat, and simplified controls.  Bass sucks power..  This thing gets pretty damn loud and really delivers a ton of bass.  I stream to it in the backyard when swimming in the pool..  It has really been great.  It has been accidentally kicked into the pool a few times.. but no damage, and it has proven to be water resistant as advertised.",2021,05
For some reason when I charger it it does not last long. Sometimes I even have to use it while I’m charging. Might have to return it,2021,05
Bought my second one - other one is back at home whilst I'm traveling the worlds oceans. Good sound. Fair price and good quality. Good battery life. Highly recommended.,2021,05
"I recommend everyone for this speaker, I'm lucky to have it.",2021,05
Love love love this item! Light weight and very durable…,2021,05
It is on the heavier side but overall no issues. Has an unexpectedly long charging cord.,2021,05
Lot's of good Sound Quality from a little size. Perfect fit in my Bike beach basket !!!,2021,05
Na,2021,05
"Love my JBL Speaker! Perfect for any room in the house, the park or campfire. Great sound and very easily charged. Also easy to carry in a small backpack or case. Easily connects to other JBL speakers.",2021,05
Battery life is good. I drive trucks with a 10 hr shift. I charge it every 3 days.,2021,05
I completely love my pink JBL 🥰🥰,2021,05
"This speaker works great clear sound and the battery last a long time, Only bad thing is if it gets hot it will shut off. So keep in a shady spot outside.",2021,05
Sounds good. Got money's worth,2021,05
Sound is awesome plus water proof is a bonus!,2021,05
"If you are buying this most probably you have done your research, and for me, it lives up to its expectation. The speaker delivers deep bass for something of its size and is loud enough to fill a large room. If you want to use it outdoors It will definitely get the neighbors wondering if you're having a party. It gets pretty loud without getting distorted and at around 80% is when there is sound distortion. Great for movie night in bed and for listening to music. Having owned the Flip 4 twice this is definitely an upgrade especially with its charging, but I wish it had a strap or handle like the bigger and smaller versions of this speaker and I wish it had a microphone sometimes, but I also understand why they didn't include it on here.",2021,05
I LOVE THIS!!! Only it won't hook up to my phone calls via bluetooth.Sound quality is amazing! I love the battery life!!,2021,05
This is everything I was looking for but after having it if there was one thing I can add it would be a button to forward/skip to the next song. But that’s just a first world problem. Like I said it was everything I was looking for.,2021,05
"A little difficult trying to tie to of them together. Finally found the trick turn both on let them automatically connect to phone. One connected, hit the stereo mode buttons at same time. For me it worked every time. Have to buy two atleast because in stereo mode they sound great. Bass is decent not as much as I like but they have great sound quality. So if your a sound quality and not a bass person these are good.",2021,05
Sounds great for out doors sitting area... Highly recommend!!!!!,2021,05
Quite charging so now it's a paper weight.,2021,05
"I love this speaker. It’s really awesome. It’s loud. It’s cute. The only thing I don’t like is the fact that I haven’t had it for very long and the fabric is dingey. I keep it in my case when not in use and it barely gets touched, just moved from one spot to another if anything. I’ve tried wet cloths and all that but it’s just a weird uncleanable material.",2021,05
"We have two other, smaller JBL speakers (Flip 4) which we really liked, but wanted a bit larger one to connect to those, to have a full stereo effect - and we're not disappointed!  In fact, this one took over the top fav spot above the Flip 4's!  Good sound, good battery stamina, good size.",2021,05
My favorite Bluetooth speaker I’ve owned. Sound quality is amazing especially given its size.,2021,05
none of the buttons worked once connected and I got help from tech at jbl website who said to return it as defective,2021,05
Great product! Couldn’t be happier with this purchase.,2021,05
So it definitely doesn’t play for 15 hours the battery was drained after five straight hours .  I thought it was gonna be a bit louder I knew I should have just got the boom box.,2021,05
Love it! Portable.  Long battery life and amazing sound. Super easy to use.,2021,05
"I was left speachless when first played this speaker. Amazing sound, incredible battery life. Something that I've noticed with the time that when doing the JBL Connect thing when joining multiple speakers it goes crazy, sometimes it freezes and I must do a hard shutdown.",2021,05
The sound quality is good.  Only thing is it would be nice if it can go louder. Higher volume.,2021,05
"Great sound, nifty package and a joy to play music or an audio book through. Should have bought one years ago.",2021,05
The price for such a big speaker which isn’t too loud,2021,05
"When you come to bass line in the ripa, take it.",2021,05
Great device.  Sound is good.  Base is good.  Bluetooth connect is smooth.  Battery is great.,2021,05
My son loves it that’s all that matters,2021,05
Perfectly executed design with a beautiful exterior. Doesn’t lose sound quality when the volume is set to a high setting.,2021,05
"This is a great standalone bluetooth speaker. Unfortunately JBL Connect+ is wildly unpredictable so if you want to connect multiple, compatible JBL speakers using this technology you will experience lots of dropouts of one or the other of the speakers. It's very frustrating. Otherwise the sound is great, battery life is superb, etc.. I use it while camping quite a lot and it gets me through multiple days of normal use without even considering a recharge.",2021,05
"I really like this Bluetooth speaker. JBL nailed it with this series. I can connect my speaker with friends speakers for the ultimate stereo experience! Highly recommend. Ive tried other brands, but this is by far the best sounding, and I can listen all day!",2021,05
"This was a great purchase, I would gladly buy it again if I had to.",2021,05
Sounds great in spite of its size. Very durable. Super handy. I’d buy it again in a heartbeat!,2021,05
Love it!!,2021,05
Same poor quality as a giveaway Bluetooth speaker. How can something so average be so expensive?,2021,05
Love my JBL. I can take with me anywhere.,2021,05
"I wish it were just a little louder, but over all, the sound is great.",2021,05
After giving it time and using it more I find this speaker is perfect for me and I take it to work with me a lot and listen to music since I work by myself. I’m glad I bought this!,2021,05
Bought this for our boat amazing sound and now were using it for outdoor movies in the backyard and camping love this product,2021,05
Love it  I use it in my side by side  Out on the patio  or back yard,2021,05
Great speaker. Love that I can use it outside.Easy setup.,2021,05
"Works amazing! We have a house full of various jbl speakers but I wanted a big one for our shed. Easy to use, holds a charge awesome, super easy to pair. And the blue color is perfect. Love that it has a flat area on the bottom for a stand with the controls on top. Ports have a nice sturdy flap covering them to keep out dust and dirt",2021,05
Excellent sound quality,2021,05
loved it,2021,05
"Its not too heavy, it produces great sound, the battery life is great, and the controls are simple and easy to understand.",2021,05
It won’t charge! I have to send it back,2021,05
"Sound quality and ease of operation were great.  We bought the unit in December of 2020, and now it won't power up.  We tried to re set it and nothing happens.  So now we have to buy another unit.  Not sure what to buy.",2021,05
Battery life is great and has a good amount of bass but you won’t be able to feel it after you move away from the the speaker. It sounds better when connected to my iPhone than it does connected to my Samsung  I haven’t tried out the charge feature yet though,2021,05
Great bass and battery life but crackles at low volume but sounds great at 20% and up,2021,05
"Worth every penny, sounds great",2021,05
If you forget this speak on your car and it flys off at 40mph it will survive! Takes a lickin and keeps on ticking!,2021,05
I've had this speaker for 3 days under a year and it won't take a charge anymore.  The sound was decent but I don't recommend.  That much money should buy a batter that lasts longer.  Either cheap parts or bad design.,2021,05
The bass of the speaker is great and the battery life is far greater than I expected.,2021,05
Literally best speaker out there amazing battery life and sound will blow ur house up if it's maxed 😂😂,2021,05
"I found one of these on the street back in the winter that had fallen off someone's bike or car.  After unsuccessful attempts to find the owner, I ended up keeping it.  I figured after being dropped and rained on, it wouldn't work.  But it did!  The sound is maybe not the best you could find -- but it's not at all terrible.  If you want something rugged that you can take to the water, this would be a good speaker.",2021,04
Not good enough.  Sound quality was just ok.,2021,04
I can’t believe I didn’t purchase this Bluetooth speaker sooner. It sounds sooo good. Perfect amount of bass too(for the bass lovers). Battery life is excellent as well.,2021,04
Loud and easy to use. Good base,2021,04
Bought for my garage. Used less than 20 times and won't play. Turns on and immediately powers off. Even plugged in. Big waste of money.,2021,04
"this came so safely packaged so it wouldn’t break. recommend getting this, good sound, connects easily, and the battery lasts long. good for listening loud music!",2021,04
Battery life & sound quality are top notch!!,2021,04
"This speaker has amazing sound quality and is such an upgrade from my phone speaker. I use it in my home, but it is also compact enough to be great for travel, taking to the pool, the beach, and more. My only complaint is that the battery life seems a little short, so I often bring a little portable charger for it on the go.",2021,04
I absolutely love everything about this,2021,04
Love it. Never disappointed with sound.,2021,04
LOVE THIS SPEAKER!!,2021,04
Incredible sound.,2021,04
This little box has great sound!!  I love it,2021,04
Very loud,2021,04
"Excellent sound! Great bass and treble, but it doesn't seem possible to change any equalizer settings. Every time the speaker is turned on/off it makes a rather loud noise, it's pleasant, just kind of loud.",2021,04
Great product,2021,04
Good 👍,2021,04
The sound is definitely not that great,2021,04
Sound quality is good. Very good battery life and design. Good speaker to have around the house or while working out in the home gym. However not loud enough for a wind beach day.,2021,04
Good battery life and good quality sound,2021,04
"Loud, with crisp Audio and good bass! Perfect for days at the lake, work shop, and days of cleaning! Definitely worth the buy! Charge lasts a long time, and it travels well.",2021,04
" Absolutely love it!!! I have been wanting this so long and now I can’t stop using it every day😇 I haven’t charged it since I opened the package, it’s been a week already.",2021,04
Love is speaker and the sound quality is awesome  🤘🤘,2021,04
Very good,2021,04
great sound,2021,04
"I had been using a friend's Charge 3 and liked it, so I was looking at the Charge 3 and 4 when I bought mine.  The Charge 4 is a little bit bigger and has a better/louder sound.  I was very happy with my purchase!  I like that it has Aux port and Bluetooth capabilities!  I use both features.  I teach a Zumba class and I don't have to charge it too often.  It's plenty loud and doesn't need to be plugged in for class.",2021,04
Super,2021,04
same as described,2021,04
"Battery lasts less than half the time advertised, not sure if I received defective products or what.  Previous version lasted much longer.",2021,04
Perfect,2021,04
Hopefully mine was the outlier because mine was bricked on arrival. Power button only lit up while plugged in and even then none of the buttons would function and the unit would not play music even when showing full battery. I have a Flip 4 already which I love and am highly disappointed I had to get a refund. I expected better from JBL,2021,04
"Very satisfied with product.  The sound quality, battery life, & extremely durable.",2021,04
Took on a camping trip/boat trip and had no issues.,2021,04
This was used once I thought  was my phone. Will not pair with any device.,2021,04
"Excellent sound quality,  easy bluetooth connection, battery life is great!",2021,04
"It works, but within reason. This review is relative to what you're looking to get out of the speaker. For myself, it's not loud enough and as the battery levels deplete, so does the quality and volume of sound.",2021,04
"It puts out great sound, easy to connect with, battery life is great. It is really hard to say anything bad about this speaker, well worth the price.",2021,04
"Incredible sound, long battery life.",2021,04
"Decent speaker, nothing revelatory, but the form factor is great. It gets the noise out there effectively.Pros: Battery life feels like it’s infinite. Bluetooth connectivity is the best I’ve ever experienced. Handsome unit.Cons: Thuddy sound, but some of that is bluetooth, some of that is streaming, some of that is the fact that it’s not very big.Overall: Effectively fills the sonic gap between my home speakers and my laptop, which is what it was meant for.",2021,04
This speaker has great sound and volume. The battery last a long time with intermittent use. My kids are always borrowing it because it works so well.,2021,04
"Quality of sound is good however volume level compared to previous model sucks, and the Bluetooth changed so now the old models can’t connect to the new models, that’s really dumb to not have back compatible technology. My sister has previous model and it fills a back yard of several acres. I can barely hear this across my warehouse, would say it’s 1/2 to 3/4 as loud as previous. Bought it to hear above the refrigerator units and its disappointing for the price. Oh well I guess that’s the price you pay for buying something online that you can’t hear the exact unit first.",2021,04
Sound doesnt expect as wanted,2021,04
Very good speaker,2021,04
Ok,2021,04
"Good buy, it lisent very good and good quality",2021,04
"Excellent,  very satisfied with this buy!",2021,04
"I use this for my laptop speaker, great sound but the power is not always easy to maintain. I used my docking station and it has been struggling. When I finally move to a real charger it works great.",2021,04
"This product has malfunctioned and been glitchy sine the day I got it. The Bluetooth never worked properly, with the unit automatically disconnecting and shutting off. I kept assuming “operator error”, but that is not the case. I have done factory reset and googled troubleshooting. I have barely used it and it no longer charges; intermittently connects on Bluetooth. For a few days this speaker would work when directly connected to my phone. However, after 20 minutes the unit automatically turns off (while plugged in to power). Troubleshoot on the web revealed many problems. Don’t buy this.",2021,04
"JBL speakers are trash when it comes to battery. I had the JBL xtreme and the battery wouldn't hold a charge, it had to be plugged in to use it. Finally threw that one in the garbage and bought the charge 4. Three weeks in and the speaker won't charge at all. The sound quality isn't that great either, sucky bass and only has one speaker on the right side. It's not worth what it costs. This speaker should be no more than $60. Returning this crap and gonna look into a better speaker. Don't waste your time.",2021,04
Sound quality Great. Excellent batt. life use. Waterproof.?? No Monsoon Yet. Or poolside use.?,2021,04
"Super easy to connect to. It's a really powerful and loud thing. I'm 100% happy with its addition to my patio, my neighbors, not so much.",2021,04
Nun but good vibes 😎,2021,04
"Small, solid, compact, durable, high quality speaker with 'big sound, and long lasting rechargeable batteries.",2021,04
"I bought this specifically for a pool party . It's loud, waterproof, not obnoxiously big and can still fit in a bag, loving my aqua color. I wasn't home so my husband did an unboxing.Idk about everyone else but regardless if this only has 1 internal speaker it's jbl. I go for quality over quantity. The sound is impeccable.",2021,04
It’s great to take music and podcasts with me in whatever room or location I’m at.,2021,04
I think this is a great price-quality product,2021,04
Good sound,2021,04
The sound was great,2021,04
"Had device 5 months and it quit, won't turn on or off, very disappointed, way to much money for 6 months of use!!",2021,04
Sounds great. Excellent quality.,2021,04
Sound quality,2021,04
Great sound!,2021,04
"I’ve had this for 3 years just about and it worked fine up until recently it just stopped working. Power button does nothing, reset does nothing. No response whatsoever. It just died. I don’t know why.",2021,04
"I really did not like it, the battery does not last at all, I think it was a bad purchase, other brands last longer than the battery.",2021,04
I have a charge 3 and when the charge 4 went on sale had to get another one I love these little speakers,2021,04
PURCHASED 2 OF THEM NOT VERY LOUD AT FULL VOLUME . MY OLD MARLEY IS LOUDER.,2021,04
JBL Charge 4 is great product. I didn't disappoint about it. Thanks,2021,03
"I had a Charge 3 prior, got stolen. Picking up the 4 was a no brainer considering the USB C upgrade.",2021,03
"This is by far the best speaker I’ve ever had, I’m sticking with this brand for a while!",2021,03
"It was decent while it lasted, but died on me one month after the warranty expired so I’m very disappointed in this product. Would definitely not recommend it.",2021,03
Great sound and battery life.,2021,03
"Sound quality is very good, better bass response than my Charge 3. Good battery life, rugged, waterproof, good max volume level. Overall, an excellent product. The only downside is it's a bit too large to fit in a bicycle bottle cage. A Charge 3 works well for that purpose.",2021,03
The JBL Charge 4 is definitely a great speaker. Fantastic sound quality the entire battery life. The battery lasts me hours on hours and takes no time to charge.,2021,03
"Does what it claims, good sound, good battery life.",2021,03
"An attractive, high performing speaker that exceeded my expectations. First the bad news: I did have difficulty at first pairing my phone with the speaker. The included instructions were no help and I would have liked to see a bit more detail; it's just a series of what look like comic book panels.  I begrudgingly downloaded the JBL Portable app, found a bit more information and was able to pair. Straight out of the box, the sound is a bit disappointing. The speaker did not produce much bass and was really heavy in the upper midrange and high frequencies. I would highly recommend downloading an equalizer app on your music source device.  Now the good news: The equalizer made this speaker come alive. Volume for days, and more bass that I would have expected for a speaker this size. The fact that it can also charge your music source device is even more reason to select this speaker.",2021,03
Awesome sounds for this little speaker! I also like how you can use it as an external battery to charge other devices. Hopefully it will survive the AZ summer heat next to the pool. Updates to come.,2021,03
"Absolutely love this speaker!! Very loud, durable, and has great battery life.",2021,03
"very good sound. Easy Blue tooth connection. registering this product on the Harmon/JBL website is a nightmare. Dont know, but I'll bet their customer service is the same... just sayin'",2021,03
Money well spent,2021,03
Great sounds  better than my charge 2...,2021,03
Very good sound and very well made,2021,03
Excellent sound quality. Much louder than I expected. Small enough to take just about anywhere. I've gotten it pretty wet several times and still going strong. Great product!,2021,03
The sound quality is amazing,2021,03
"I went from Flip 4 to Charge 4. Awesome bass!!!  This is a mono speaker. The Flip 4 is stereo which if you like hifi sound quality, the Flip 5 is also mono. The Charge is loud and bass hits.",2021,03
"Superb sound quality. Great dynamic range. Crisp highs and deep, deep, bass. Battery lasts for at least 10 hours. Pairing is quick and stable. App is simple and works fine. Can check charge level and play stereo or party mode with additional speakers. Seems durable and I only hope it lasts. Buy 2 and get a ridiculously great mobile stereo for about $300.",2021,03
It's a nice product but I expected better sound.ive looked at them in best buy n they were awesome.had I known this wasn't what I expected I wouldn't have bought it.,2021,03
"Works fantastically. I would just like it to be a bit louder. But, overall a great product.",2021,03
"Someone gave me a Charge 3. I bought a Charge 4, thinking I could pair them. Nope.So I bought another Charge 4. Pairing is difficult if you desire stereo sound, as opposed to two mono speakers. Had to get a second JBL app and attempt to import my music into it, some of which won’t play. When I do get it to play in stereo, it doesn’t stay that way for long. The hardware/software combo has been finicky and temperamental for me.Also, Amazon is not letting me add an informative photo.",2021,03
Amazing,2021,03
"Love it so far. Got it, was basically fully charged and played all day at the pool...barely saw any decrease in power. Love the sound and the good bass. Able to control sound EQ via the settings on my phone (for those recognizing it doesn't seem to have an EQ in an app or something. We are stepping up from the JBL Clip 3 (which is also really great! just doesn't have the volume we wanted for a patio or at the pool). Fills a locker room full of sound easy too. Able to listen at low volume and still have full depth of sound.  Many commented about the mono sound aspect, but honestly, I love this sound. It's full, and the highs/mids are pronounced with clarity, no distortion.My only nit is that it definitely will muffle if like a towel is over it or something... not really worth knocking my rating tho (had it in my sport bag and could notice a decrease in clarity).Solid purchase, very happy with it.",2021,03
AWESOME!!!!,2021,03
Great!!!,2021,03
"My speaker will not accept any additional charge, and turns off within a few minutes of playing music. I have tried the factory reset but think it may be a hardware issue.",2021,03
"The quality of the sound is pretty dope, I use this when I work on stuff and when I walk away from the speaker a good 15 feet I’m still connected to the Bluetooth and the battery life is amazing as well",2021,03
"Just arrive today, so far so good!The black looks so elegant. The bass is heavy and the audio quality it’s perfect.",2021,03
"Never had an issue with refurbished until this one. Was dirty, and won’t turn on. I recommend not getting a used one. It’s worth the time and extra money to get it new.",2021,03
Definitely worth it,2021,03
That’s the first small speaker I bought but I really do like it. It sounds clear and loud!,2021,03
"luv this speaker.  was disappointed when i received it cause it looked small and i thought how such a speaker of this size could satisfy me.  but then i hooked it up and wow.  I downloaded an equalizer app from the google store and now have full control on my listening pleasures and great sounds.  i can control the sounds thru my tablet, the speaker itself and the equalizer app.  all three have volume control.  truly, not sorry i bought this speaker.  I take it with me , hook it up in the trunk of my car and the sound just resonates with the truck door open.  the enclosure of the car trunk makes the sound incredible.  great buy.",2021,03
Took it to work with me a few times and had my job feeling like a club with how much base it pumps out and the sound is crisp and clean.,2021,03
"I am blown away at how poor this product truly is. At first I thought it didn't work at all because there was no sound, but apparently a half charge is not enough for there to be sound but once it was fully charged it worked. Once getting the product working I turned on some music and the amount of bass ruined the music, I had to download an equalizer app just to get the music to even sound decent and not crackle. I took it to work the next day with a full charge and went to use it and again no sound. I turned it off and took it home still with a full battery. Went to try it again a few days later and the battery was drained even though it had been turned off. Overall I am impressed with not one thing about this speaker. And you are proud to charge as much as you do for this product? I'd have better success buying one from the dollar store.  Do not buy.",2021,03
sounds great but battery only lasts about 6 hours at full blast,2021,02
Absolutely love it,2021,02
"Great sound however stopped working with no sound after only over a year. Contacted JBL, only a one year warranty they only offered a discount code to buy another speaker. No thanks.",2021,03
BatteryLife not good,2021,03
Great product,2021,03
Great sound and quality!,2021,03
"well packaged, works well, seemingly good thing",2021,03
"Can beat the sound for the size. This JBL speaker has been a perfect speaker, we just replaced our 3 with this 4 model. Crisp clear and loud if needed! Lasts forever it seems and connects easy with BT.",2021,03
"Bought to replace a Charge 2+Great sound and connection to phone.  Unfortunately, will not chain with older Charge 2+",2021,03
"I’m returning mine after just 6 months.Sound quality is bad, sounds like the the bass is vibrating so crazy I can’t hear what is being said and it is very annoying.",2021,03
the user guide and charge cable did not come. it was supposed to.,2021,03
Like everything about it,2021,03
"Let me start with what everyone is most interested in.  These have great sound quality for the size.  They have better bass than you'd expect but the treble could be a little stronger.  I've turned the volume way up just to see how they handle the power and they hold up well.  You can blast them without worry as long as you have good source material.  I bought 2 so I could output in stereo.  It's a bit quirky trying to get them into stereo mode but it does work.  However, for some reason they glitch occasionally which causes a dropout when playing in stereo.  I think it has to do with the bluetooth communication between speakers.  I'm hoping they can come up with a firmware update to fix it.  I don't have this problem when just using 1 speaker.  All in all I would recommend buying these.",2021,03
Gift for  grandson,2021,03
Great product all the way around. I heard my sons speaker and was sold. I would like a little more bass but what can you expect for a small speaker. Very happy with my purchase.,2021,03
Amazing soubd,2021,03
great speaker. has good bass and loud sound. holds battery for a long time.,2021,03
"Bought it, no regrets. The doin quality is super bomb. Gets loud and the bass is quality. Love the size. The design it solid. Packaging is A1. It really is a win, get it get it get it.",2021,03
Love it!!!,2021,03
Great sound quality and battery life,2021,03
Just love it sound is amazing and battery life phenomenal. Easy to use to pair with your Android phone.,2021,03
I have really enjoyed the sound quality of this Bluetooth device! It is small and portable but sturdy. I love the box it came in to keep it protected and easy to store.,2021,02
"Ya know, for almost $200 I thought I'd be more impressed. Sound quality isn't bad but the bass interferes with the sound quality and makes it wobbly to where I'm scared to play it loud. Ue doesn't do that :/ like others mentioned too it is a mono speaker which isn't great when I'm looking for full directional quality sound",2021,02
I bought this for our wrestling room which is very large and this just isn't quite big enough for that.  I do however like the sound and feel it is a very good speaker.  Just know that it isn't for a large area.,2021,02
This is a great speaker light and easy to work basic controls that get the job done with no confusion  I ordered a carry strap for it from Amazon as well u must get the carry strap for hanging and protection.  I gave it 4 out of 5 for sound quality it delivers more bass than treble great speaker for the money.  Claims to have a 15-20 hr battery based on use and is waterproof can’t touch that plenty loud for the beach or backyard,2021,02
"This speaker is awesome. I was a bit skeptical about the passive radiators, but I was impressed. It doesn't pump bass as much as a wired speaker such as Echo Plus, but the sound is still excellent, and the battery life is great. I usually play music off and on during my workweek and charge it once per week. I gave it 4 stars due to the poor USB-C implementation. The speaker charges through its USB-C port, however it is only able to output power (to act like a powerbank and charge a phone, for example) through its USB-A port. My recommendation to JBL is to ditch the USB-A port entirely, and use the USB-C port for charging and power output.",2021,02
Love this thing. Sounds great. Good bass for a small unit. Very satisfied.,2021,02
"I bought a refurbished one, but it looked brand new and untouched, so I saved a few bucks, and that was good. The green color is cool, much cooler than black, which was my second, more expensive choice. It connected immediately (almost) to my ipad, iphone, macbook. The sound is great. It's very loud, but I don't play it that loud yet. I bought it to use outdoors for music, so I expect it will work well paired with an iphone. It's a simple, compact device, but it delivers great sound. Could not be happier. And it's waterproof, which I hope never to test, but it's nice to know because it will be outside, and might get left outdoors overnight on occasion. Battery life seems fine so far, but I have only used it for a few hours. Time will tell on that one.",2021,02
"I'm an artist, so I like listening to music while I paint. This pairs with my phone and I listen and paint.",2021,02
Love it second purchased first one was so good it walked out of my house on its own lol,2021,02
"Upgraded from the Flip 4. So far, very happy with my purchase. Only now I want bigger and louder speakers! Extreme next? We will see.",2021,02
"its amazing, i love it",2021,02
"This was a pandemic lockdown buy.  My wife and I were spending a lot of time outside on our patio. Our happy hours were missing something... great sounds!  This speaker delivers great sound at low, mid, and high range.  It can also play very loud, although we keep the volume pretty low to be respectful of our neighbors.I would recommend this speaker to a friend.",2021,02
"I've had this speaker for well over a year now.  I use it full volume in the shower while its soaking wet and also outside on the patio.  I've had it connected to my smaller TV that I move between porch and patio but my Sony works better for that due to the Sony app to control the volume via bluetooth being much better than the JBL app.  It still looks and works as good as when I first got it.  Battery lasts a good amount of time and it has incredible bass for its size - especially if its placed against a wall or better yet, in an inside corner.  I have been very happy with its quality and performance.Now some negative aspects.  The battery level indicator lights are placed very low so they are not visible in most cases and then the unit just goes dead with no warning when the charge runs out.  The base is small compared to the speaker so it can easily roll over and off a table if bumped.  Speakers are on the ends so you can't stand it up vertical.  It does make a loud melodic sound when turned off.  It is pretty rugged and waterproof so the addition of a case adds no value, is just another useless item cluttering your life and is environmentally negative.  I suggest getting one without the case.  The current price is much, much more (50 percent more) than when I purchased it - maybe due to Covid price gouging or just rampant inflation.  Never buy a used product that requires a built-in battery as someone is unloading it because its defective or reached its end of life even if it still looks like new.",2021,02
Great sound. Battery lasts all day!,2021,02
Great speaker,2021,02
Great sound for price.,2021,02
We liked the first one so much that we bought a 2nd one for my husband to use for traveling.,2021,02
both sounds and bass are great quality. I was outside the other day listening to music from my phone and I had a neighbor come by from 4 houses down opposite side of the street asking me to turn it up.  I laughed and said it was already on the highest volume. Impressed with how far the sound carried.,2021,02
Powerful little guy. Good bass. Good volume. Looking for a good wireless speaker this will not dissapoint.,2021,02
Basically battery quit taking a charge. Then I had to mail it in to get another. The turn around was quick.,2021,02
"I bought this JBL as a change from our little Bose portable speaker.  I shouldn't have.  The sound is 'meh', is bass-lite,  and certainly not worth the price paid.  I expected more from JBL.  Am sending this unit back and buying another Bose.",2021,02
The best purchase i ever made 👌🏼,2021,02
Lasts for a few hours at close to max volume and obviously longer the lower the volume is. Great over all for the price but the back has an annoying clicking sound like the screws to a panel are lose.,2021,02
Love it!,2021,02
Perfect all-around BTooth speaker.,2021,02
Definitley bigger then the last one we had,2021,02
Everything I Expected,2021,02
The sound is awesome! Very nice speaker for it's size.,2021,02
"This thing rocks! Even took it to the beach. It became sandy, but easy to clean!!",2021,02
I accidentally dropped this thing in the ocean where it floated for two days before I found it ashore.  It still works. Minus the audio (which faces one way) this is a quality speaker.,2021,02
"I have 2 of the JBL GO 2 Bluetooth speakers that produce tremendous sound quality for such a small unit, and the portability is the reason  I bought them. Recently I decided to upgrade to the Charge 4, and I must say I am truly amazed by the incredibly powerful sound quality of this unit. Don't wait, buy it today!",2021,02
"The aux input doesn't work properly. The sound keeps cutting out; this is simply bad design, and when I contacted JBL support about this, here was their official response: ""Our JBL Charge 4 normally goes on standby when there is no sound coming out of the speaker for a while. This feature can't be turned off."" They called their poor design a ""feature,"" much in the same way faulty brakes on a car is a feature.They also solicited me for a 5-star review and incentivized me with a $5 gift card... so 3 stars.",2021,02
Very nice sound.,2021,02
"I am thrilled with the speaker. I use it to play podcasts, mostly, when exercising. Sound is excellent for spoken text, and does a good job with commercial pop, rock, etc. It is NOT suitable for most art music (i.e. classical). Does not handle the wide dynamic range of this type of music, nor the subtle timbres of instrumental ensembles.",2021,02
Plenty loud to play music in my garage while I workout with the door open. No need to spend more for a bigger speaker.,2021,02
I am in love with my speaker.,2021,02
"just Not enough bass.On the flip side, I bought the next step up the JBL boom box and it had to much bass.I chose too much bass over to little bass.",2021,02
Would've given 5 star but not as impressed with battery life as much as I was with the charge 3. Other than that sound is impeccable as expected!,2021,02
Decent good volume and long battery life and little bigger and better then the flips the charge feature is ok i guess but drains the battery quickly other then that it last long and loud great little speaker glad i have it,2021,02
"easy to travel with and use , great fun!",2021,02
i love my speaker i got it 2 days ago i will update yalll,2021,02
Love the sound.,2021,02
The sound quality is great and it’s just plain fun!!!!,2021,02
So far I am very statisfied with it,2021,02
Excellent,2021,02
"Practically all bluetooth speakers are MONO, it has nothing to do with how many drivers/speakers/cones it has.  To get stereo sound you usually need to have two of the same (or typically at least the same brand) bluetooth speaker and send different audio (Right or Left) to each one.The Charge3 had two forward facing mid/high range drivers driven by same signal so they effectively acted as one driver/speaker.  Charge4 replaced the two forward facing drivers with a single larger higher quality forward facing driver that produces better depth and definition, at least in my opinion.  I'll take the Charge4 over the Charge3 (or the Flip5) any day.",2021,02
Sounds really good,2021,02
good,2021,02
I love it’s portability. It’s loud In proximity but not too obnoxiously loud to disturb neighbors when I use it in my open garage. It connects quickly and it’s easy to pair. Battery life lasts much longer than a JBL flip. Lastly purchasing a strap accessory is a good investment so you can carry it around.,2021,02
Buy it.,2021,02
Besides driver totally dropping my package on my door step and I watched him act like he didn'tThis speaker is great the only thing I wish it had like the jbl flip 3 is its own sperate volume instead relying off just solely the phones volume this is great for a 10hr shift,2021,02
Great Speaker great sound,2021,02
"Husband uses in his semi, and it has worked out great for him!",2021,02
ONE OF THE BEST SPEAKERS I HAVE EVER PURCHASED.,2021,02
It works amazing it’s nice for traveling you hear clearly the battery works and last long,2021,02
This speaker is worth every penny.,2021,02
"Keep reading reviews that boast about the bass. Not true at all. Only provides mid bass and not low pass, so it sounds muffled and offbeat when listening to music with very low bass. That was important to me,  and the reviews were misleading.",2021,02
"Good for the beach, back yard or picnic with a 20 hour play time.",2021,02
Not enough bass,2021,02
I had high hopes for this JBL Charge 4. It’s a good name brand with good reviews. I gave it a shot but couldn’t get used the the mono sound and the fact there’s no equalizer. My ears just weren’t happy.The Bluetooth worked great. It’s solid and connected every time with no issues. Battery life seems good though I haven’t kept it long enough to actually confirm this.I am returning it and keeping the Soundcore Motion Boom which I purchased a week later as a comparison. It’s stereo sound far more superior and can be paired with an equalizer phone app. Therefore the Charge 4 is going back.,2021,02
Great speaker sound quality is clear and loud,2021,02
"This speaker is great, it price is worth it especially when it was on sale. Great sound and it can loud enough for outside use too.",2021,01
"So pleased with this device. Have had it for a few years now and am constantly impressed by it. Sound quality is so good, bass is strong when wanted and the battery life is unbelievable. Would highly recommend to others.",2021,01
"Received for Christmas in December and it stopped working in the beginning of February. While it was playing music it stopped and has not turned back on since, despite being charged over night and it being a month later of trying everything to make it work again. No lights or sign of life. Strongly would not recommend.",2021,01
"Bought this for my husband and it was so easy to connect to Bluetooth, no apps required and the sound is terrific, better than expected in this price range.",2021,01
Not good sound,2021,01
Good quality sound Welbilt,2021,01
"Sound quality is decent for the price point in the segment. One complaint is the lowest volume setting is too loud for an office setting, which was the main purpose of my purchase. The drivers are OK for the size but don't expect to hear all the lows from your music. It's better than most but for the money, I'd rather have spent a little more and gotten a larger, more versatile speaker.",2021,01
I love,2021,01
In 2 months this stop working,2021,01
"Excellent sound, Good build quality, Supports aux in.Annoying feature turns sound off if volume low but acceptable workaround turn up volume on device.App is only to connect multiple speakers, no other features.  For me not an issue.",2021,01
It was just what I was looking for,2021,01
"Not sure what to say that others haven't already.  Really great product, rarely do I ever get a chance to turn the volume up to full, it's too loud for conversation even in a large room :-)",2021,01
Love job products battery life is amazing last pretty much 20hours I use it in my home gym no complaints at all,2021,01
Great,2021,01
I use this product all day and the battery only gets down to half! It sounds great and is easy to use.,2021,01
"First of all, the speaker is MONAURAL and you need TWO to get stereo. That's $360! Then you need an app to convince the speakers to play in stereo, and THERE IS NO APP FOR WINDOWS OR MAC, only mobile devices. I tried an Android emulator but you can't get to Bluetooth that way, so forget it. The app is crappy, too. It takes at least two tries each time to convince the speakers to play in stereo and the app has to be left running. After a while something times out, the sound reverts to monaural and the app has to be closed and re-started to make it stereo again. The only reason this speaker gets so many good reviews is that apparently most people don't care about stereo sound! What a waste. So, good sound or not, these are going back. Both of them.",2021,01
"Our Bose died, I bought this as a replacement! Very nice",2021,01
"Decent speaker for its size, but not recommended for larger rooms.",2021,01
"I like the portability of theCharge 4, sound quality, and the easy connect ability to blue tooth.",2021,01
Playing music,2021,01
Good booming sound!!! Love it and the fact I can charge my phone too!,2021,01
"I'm not a fan of frustration. Maddening, trying several times and techniques to get this thing to connect.",2021,01
This is a great speaker but the battery life is no bueno guys! In less then a month my battery life just keep on going down so be aware,2021,01
Amazing speaker. Good price,2021,01
"I’m in love with my speaker. The sound quality is amazing, the battery lasts for a long time, and it’s so easy to connect it to my phone and devices. I connected it to my laptop to watch a movie and it made me feel like I was in a movie theater again. Highly recommended buying this speaker.",2021,01
"We could only use it once, it never charged. What a shame",2021,01
I bought this before Christmas for my husband and he started using it on Christmas. It is now February and the battery just now finally died. He uses it every night and it took over 2 months for the battery to die. The sound is amazing and it connects perfectly.,2021,01
Overall a great product. I really like the feature of connecting another to it. I take this on bike rides and my buddy who has one shares music on both speakers as we ride. It has one speaker but sounds great in small to medium size rooms. This thing holds it charge and a great feature is that it’s also a battery pack for cell phones.,2021,01
I gave this to my wife as a Christmas gift.  The sound is huge and the battery lasts a really long time.  She loves it.,2021,01
Disappointed that can't connect with phone calls otherwise great,2021,01
Bought it as a gift and it was well received.,2021,01
"This thing gets loud! It's the best of both worlds because you get something light and easy to carry, but still get amazing sound. Battery on the beach goes 10+ hours consistently and we like our music loud. I also like that my wife and I can both sync our phones to it at the same time and switch from phone to phone. With my old speaker, we could only have 1 phone synced at a time and we always had to go through the process of disconnecting the current phone then re-sync the new phone by putting the device in ""find new device"" mode.  Now, it's a simple process to turn the BT off on her phone and mine will automatically connect because it's already synced. Vice versa to connect her phone back to it.",2021,01
Great sound! Easy to use & connect plus it has a great battery life.,2021,01
Great speaker. Sound quality is very good connects via Bluetooth easily. Battery last for quite a long time,2021,01
Got this for my father. He loves it! Sounds damnnn good!!!,2021,01
Welll.. it’s gonna be a no from me .. it’s not very loud at all it was kind of a disappointment compared to other cheaper Bluetooth speakers I had. Battery life? It lasted maybe 2 1/2 hours on a full battery charge .. which is also a disappointment.. as far as Bluetooth connectivity I had no issues connecting it to my phone which I guess is the only good thing I can say about it it . I definitely would NOT recommend. Just my two cents :),2021,01
"Absolutely love this speaker. Great sound, clarity. Would highly recommend.",2021,01
Sound quality for entertainment,2021,01
Like it!,2021,01
Great sound fills up my garage/workshop. Easy to set and use.,2021,01
I love this speaker! The bass is ok but it sounds good.,2021,01
I really think the sound is great the battery longevity is the best this is a great product,2021,01
Bought this for my fiancé for Christmas! I ordered the navy blue one. I was greatly surprised how wonderful the sound quality was. Plus it has good bass for a smaller speaker. It’s actually pretty loud we never really have to turn it all the way up inside the house. My fiancé loves that he can charge his phone with it also!I would purchase again!,2021,01
"This is a newer model, I had the first gen, it lasted for a while then it stopped working. I love this because it lasts for a long time and it’s sturdy.",2021,01
Sound is just as good as the smaller charge 3 not good if there is background noise like in a factory. Perfect for in house or backyard!,2021,01
"Highly recommend. This is the 3rd JBL speaker I've purchased. My kids are hard on them and leave these in the shower, take to practice, sleepovers and throw around in our golf cart. I got a great deal- no complaints! Great sound quality and durable. I recommend.",2021,01
"JBL speakers are great but I 10/10 recommend this one! The color is so cute, the sound quality is amazing and I’ve had it for a month & I’ve never charged it (to be fair I don’t use it constantly, just here and there)",2021,01
Great sound,2021,01
"Bought us a Christmas gift for a 49-year-old. Rarely does he put it down, and when he does he puts it back in the box so nothing happens to it he absolutely loves it!",2021,01
"Kicks ass. Booming bass. Best I've ever had as a portable, water-resistant, outdoor speaker. (Works great indoors too) Volume gets loud and not seemingly throttled like other speakers.At a small, distanced, campfire among pod sharers, we linked 3 speakers and it was incredible. The 2nd and 3rd speaker occasionally cut for a second but came back on, in sync too. (Believe it was in relation to distance or blockages from phone-to-speaker, rather than speaker-to-speaker. In other words, speakers around the phone can make a larger circle. Opposed to 'repeating' to go one further from the 'master' speaker in a line. )Recommend getting a case to extend the life of this awesome addition.  Enjoy!",2021,01
My first portable speaker. I love how long the battery can for for. It can charge my phone from 0 - 100 at least 3 time. I only wish it was louder for the size,2021,01
"This is one of the best speakers I've ever bought. It has great sound quality, easy Bluetooth connectivity and has great battery life.",2021,01
The bass is super cool.. I like playing it in a close room.,2021,01
Owned a JBL for 6-7 years before it died - and I played it full volume hours each day. Didn’t even think about a different brand.,2021,01
"This thing works better than I expected. So many complaints about the bass, but it seems very good for what it is... after all, it’s not a DJ speaker at a club. I had this out for no more than 15 minutes before I accidentally dropped it in a hot tub. I panicked at first but then remembered it is waterproof. After the water wicked off, it kept bumping. Very impressed so far.",2021,01
Amazing sound!,2021,01
I Love this speaker use it in my home gym. Sound quality is great !,2021,01
Very disappointed with the price of this item. I thought it would have been alit louder for the price. I probably could have gotten the same item at Best But for $40. It was purchased for an outdoor speaker,2021,01
It’s nice product for watching movies!!!,2021,01
"battery life is great was on all day full 8 hrs came back next day played again all day then I plug it in over night didn't want it to go down during the day so that's super compared to my Bose speaker barely ran 6 hrs.volume levels are huge vary lowed on high setting and again much better then my Bose speaker. I will be coming back for another one of these they connect to each other for multi room function. also the blue tooth connectivity is great I can go any were in the house with my phone and it does not loose connection or get broken up, and again this is a better speaker than my Bose hands down out of my last several speakers this one is the best.",2021,01
"Really great, to connect well, sounds great",2021,01
It's a Good speaker don't get me wrong but the JBL Flip 5 is better in sound quality and louder. You can save money if you get the Flip 5.,2021,01
This little guy is amazing! I take it everywhere. Very Durable. Worth the extra money! Awesome sound quality!,2021,01
Love this Bluetooth speaker.,2021,01
Good rich sound and plenty loud if you want.,2021,01
Very nice product. Little did I know JBL was coming out with Charge 5 so soon.,2021,01
I know it is better to give than to receive.  And I am so happy my mother-in-law loved this gift. (She was used to staticky radio broadcasts of her favorite programs.)  This speaker sounds so much better than mine; now I want one.The battery life is impressive and the sound quality is great.  Hard to believe this thing is splash-proof.,2021,01
I bought this speaker for my boyfriend for Christmas and the Bluetooth button is already broken.,2021,01
Great sound and bass! Easy to connect.,2021,01
"This speaker sounds better than my surround sound. It has a very long battery life. I use mine a few times a week and it sounds great no matter how loud I have it. My iPhone connects faster to the Bluetooth in this speaker than in my car, and I have a 2017 car so it’s pretty up to date.I’d say I would buy another one, but one is plenty for my needs. Also, it’s such good quality that I don’t think I’ll need to buy another one anytime soon. However, will recommend this speaker to everyone.",2021,01
Haven’t really used it much yet.,2021,01
Price is bit higher,2021,01
"The charge 4 does not give the same bass and sound quality as the ""BOOMBOX"" but is really quite awesome in its own respect!  When you consider it is only the size of a small thermos this ""baby"" really puts out!  Great for picnics, poolside, and anywhere you want a compact source of music.  I was really impressed with the sound...ain't your Grandpa's radio, that's for sure!!",2021,01
Love it!,2021,01
"The battery lasts a really long time, hours, while playing at a medium volume.",2021,01
My son n law LOVES IT!,2021,01
Great!!,2020,12
Bought it for my wife as a present and she wanted and loves it,2020,12
The sound on this speaker is absolutely great for its size.  Long battery life and being able to plug my phone into it is a very nice option.,2020,12
"If you want to rock out to a heavy base beat this is your speaker, but for the spoken word it isn't as good as much less expensive speakers.",2020,12
Good as expected,2020,12
I love the JBL speaker brand and this speaker lives up to the name and brand of JBL.,2020,12
Easy to pack and go!,2020,12
Totally amazing sound battery lasts forever,2020,12
"There isn't a whole lot not to like about this product. The sound quality is impressive to say the least. I have yet to find a circumstance where it is necessary to even hit half volume haha. The bass is damn near as nice as the speakers in my car (which I guess isn't saying much, I just have an H&K set up). The battery life is another very impressive part of this buy. I play my speaker probably a good 10hrs+ a day and generally don't have to charge it until the third day of doing this. I have yet to play with EQ functions on the app as out of the box the audio balance was pretty on point. All in all I can say I am extremely pleased with the product.",2020,12
"I couldn't be more pleased!  I had been looking to purchase a Bluetooth speaker for my work studio for awhile.  I've seen lots of them and was considering the purchase of a few others.  My son recommended this one when he found out what I was about to spend for the other brand.I must say, this was a GREAT recommendation.  The sound is top-notch very good quality sound.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone looking for one.  Easy to use.......Connectivity is easy.......Battery life is good!I will say, the use instructions and power cord were ""hidden"" in the box.  Nice packaging, but, I kept wondering why something like this didn't come with instructions or a charger.  Well, I had to go back and really look to find them in the box.  So, yes, it DOES have instructions and a power cord, just break down the inside of the pretty packaging.  All in all DEFINITELY a 10 out of 10!!!",2020,12
"connectivity keeps skipping out.....have even had other people try to link up and the same thing keeps happening...sound is sub-par , at best",2020,12
I started with the JBL Charge 1 and was surprised how long it survived before I had to retire it and upgrade to the JBL Charge 4. These speakers are built to last and have amazing sound quality as well as battery life. I will be an owner of this line of bluetooth speaker for life.,2020,12
This speaker is great. My husband uses it almost daily. The sound quality is superb and the charge lasts a long time. We took it on a camping trip and it lasted through the weekend on top of charging our phones,2020,12
Listen to music from you tube good Bluetooth speakers sound very good on the beaches quality is very good so far recommend for use anytime any were sounds good at beach and park buy it if you love music like like me.🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴💃💃💃☺️🙂 new comment does not last 20 hrs as stated dies after an hour of use I was charging it every night still does not work after an hour .,2020,12
"the easy ""on and off' buttons, quality of sound, color (black).  a bit heavier than anticipated but that is ok.",2020,12
"Incredibly loud, connects quickly",2020,12
"JBL has always put out fabulous sounding speakers.  I bought two - one on each side of the room on a shelf - and they sound awesome, unbelievable quality for such a small speaker. I would recommend to anyone shopping around for a d*** good sounding portable speaker to purchase at least two - more if you'd like - of these.It took me a moment or two to figure out the JBL connect app, but once I got through it (wasn't super hard), the speakers and app take care of connectivity themselves, all I have to do is jam!!",2020,12
"Why does this always happen with bluetooth speakers? I've tried multiple power sources (computer, computer charger, wall) and several usb-c cables, no charge. I can't even factory reset. I bought a $180 paper weight. Furious.",2020,12
All sound etc good,2020,12
The speaker wont stay connected for more than a minute without having to reconnect,2020,12
great sound.  i have two.  I managed to turn them into a stereo pair once but have problems since then.  they are independently stereo of course.,2020,12
"These are fantastic! The sound quality is amazing, better than our multi-thousand dollar home system of decades-old high end speakers. For those (few) who complain that the speaker is mono, I say ""Of course."" How much stereo separation would you expect out of an 8 inch system. We're getting two more, one for stereo separation in the great room. The other to bring great sound to the master bath area.",2020,12
Loved it!,2020,12
Bought it for my husband. It's great. Sound is good.,2020,12
Sound is clear and volume is loud,2020,12
the sound quality is amazing. i rarely do have the issue of my phone disconnecting & all i have to do to fix it is turn the speaker on & off,2020,12
Bbbsbdv,2020,12
It lives up to my expectation. I have used it almost everyday. It has made my life better. Love it!,2020,12
"Very clean sound, better than expected",2020,12
Grandson loves it,2020,12
Worked fine for about 3 months than died - this is the 2nd JBL speaker that did this for meI won't be buying any more JBL products.  Shoddy workmanship.Lemon * 2,2020,12
"Great sound, long battery life.",2020,12
Its a nice long lasting portable speaker.,2020,12
JBL Charge 4 - Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Gray. Best speaker ever.,2020,12
Highly recommend,2020,12
"Great for the boat, camping, apartment, etc. Connection via bluetooth is easy. Not much to say besides you get what they advertise.",2020,12
Like the size and ease of using it to travel with.  Took it to Broken Bow and it worked great on the outdoor patio.  Sound does break up some the more bass you have.  It really depends on what room you are in for the sound of this thing.  Some environments are better then other.  Easy connectivity and we have enjoyed it.  I would recommend it!,2020,12
I love it,2020,12
Great sound and volume for a small speaker,2020,12
"I don't dislike anything. I bought it to play music, esp when I leave the house but since I'm not leaving, I'm playing on the patio and basement.",2020,12
Best Bluetooth speaker on the market!,2020,12
i’ve had this speaker for years and the battery life is unreal. i left this speaker on the lowest battery possible at a friends house in his shed and then he went to college and i couldn’t get the speaker for literally a year and a half. after sitting in the freezing cold for nearly two years on the lowest battery left it still connected and played great quality for over an hour. 10/10 speaker.,2020,12
"This speaker has stellar sound quality for the money. The base is fantastic for the size of the speaker. I actually didn’t expect it to sound as good as it did. It is waterproof which was just what we were looking for. It’s hard to finda good waterproof speaker that will truly withstand more than a sprinkle of water, but this one passes the test.Our teenage kids love using it to Bluetooth the music from their phones out by the pool so you know it has seen it’s fair share of water.It also comes partially charged which was nice. We had music within minutes of taking it out of the box. It lasts about a week on a charge if we use it intermittently. I’ve never left it on for more than 4 hours at a time so I can’t speak to how long it would last continually off of a single charge.",2020,12
"overall i liked this speaker, bought it for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift, I never looked at the dimensions, its fairly small but he loved it",2020,12
I like the quality of the sound. Is is amazing. I have not tested the water proof ability of the speaker yet but I am sure it is workink:)The battery could be improved.,2020,12
Love it,2020,12
Great sound for unit size!  Bluetooth connectivity is flawless 👍,2020,12
the Battery wont fully charge and takes 2 day to charge when it should only take 5 hours. the charging system dosent work and it disconnects random sometimes while watching a movie. ive only had it for a month and used it very little. very disappointed.,2020,12
This is my first JBL product and I’m impressed!  Excellent quality and sound.  I will buy again.,2020,12
Excellent battery life and sound. Very happy with this purchase.,2020,12
this thing rocks.,2020,12
"Good quality, easy set up, the sound is perfect for my home gym.",2020,12
"I bought it a couple of weeks ago and I couldn’t be happier so far. I just have to charge it one time per week because the battery life is excellent. It’s loud and powerful. I’m obsessed with my white choice. Aesthetically, it’s very cool.",2020,12
"Problem with item and seller. Buyer beware ,scam items being sold as working good or like new.. No where did it say reduction in refund it item returned. I first contacted seller and it was broken English and wrong words being used in chat. He told me to turn off item and reset. Well it wouldn't hold a charge and we couldn't  turn item on. We could no do what he was asking. Then he got angry with me and said just return it then. Very unprofessional.  We had item before brand new no problems . This seller sold a damaged item (like new)  and knowingly did.  I feel he did because of how he acted in chat. no excuse do not buy from this man/woman.",2020,12
I love this speaker! The battery usage last so long!,2020,12
have used this speaker both indoors and outside.  great sound in both cases.  supper easy to connect to.,2020,12
Great !,2020,12
"I feel like I see this speaker everywhere, and it's a great speaker. Super loud and great quality for the size/price. No complaints there. I have 2 main issues:1: Too much bass. I think it's crazy to say for a speaker like this but it's true. Sounds great for some songs, too muddy in others. I don't need EQ settings, but a bass boost on/off would be nice.2: There's no way to go back one song with the speaker controls. This is legitimately frustrating. I've read the manual and googled it, but the controls let you adjust volume, play/pause, and skip to the next song. I can't go back and replay a song without going back to my phone to control it.",2020,12
Sound was not as bold as I had hoped.,2020,12
"I bought two of these speakers and was quite satisfied at first. My first would not hold the charge after quite a bit of use. I bought a second one and the battery would not hold a charge. I contacted the company and I was never contacted. The speaker is good, battery and customer service is quite questionable.",2020,12
Have been eyeball this one for years! Love the pink color! Looks exactly as it does in the picture.,2020,11
"The sound quality is pretty good, could not turn up volume past about halfway without getting distortion and bass was bottoming. Battery is great. Too much mid range. A little large and heavy, no handles or convenient way to carry. I like the sound of my old Bose mini sound link slightly better but will not get as loud of course.",2020,12
Love it. Great sound and good base.,2020,12
🥰,2020,12
"I love these JBL speakers. Everything I want, portable, loud enough, easy to use. Make sure you purchase the 2 year protection plan as they always stop charging external devices in that tine",2020,12
Perfect for filling space with sound and blocking out ambient noise.,2020,12
Love it. Such good sound and works everywhere,2020,12
Love this JBL speaker. The sound quality is amazing and Bluetooth connectivity easy.,2020,12
Very good product. Sound quality is amazing,2020,12
3rd JBL bluetooth speaker I've owned over the years. Solid quality and sound. Battery is good but not going to wow with longevity.,2020,12
Great speaker and sound quality. Use it every weekend golfing.,2020,12
"Great speaker, I feel like it was worth the money",2020,12
i bought this for my brother and tried it out before i gave it to him.  it has amazing sound quality!  almost kept it for myself.,2020,12
Work,2020,12
Sounds really good and gets louder than you could expect out of its size. Makes a great outdoor shop speaker or bbq speaker.,2020,12
"I love this speaker! The battery lasts for days and days. I m can use this for at least six hrs a day for 5 days before I have to charge it. I never had an issue connecting with Bluetooth to my laptop, phone or TV. It's a little larger than my old JBL but that's fine, I don't travel with it too often and when I do, it fits neatly into a backpack.",2020,12
"Sound quality, Bluetooth & size is amazing!",2020,12
"Happy I purchased this product.  The sound quality is good and it's perfect for just daily listening in your office or living room.  I sometimes connect it to my laptop when I stream shows.  Has the power to fill up a large living room with good quality sound.  I haven't used it outdoors, but I am confident that it can provide all the power you need for a backyard BBQ.Battery life is also very good.  This device is pretty easy to connect to and use.  I would recommend this for someone who is looking for an easy to use sound system who wants to casually listen to music while doing other things.",2020,12
"It’s perfect, I love it",2020,12
"I had it for two Months. From the first day, it kept turning on and off  and it became more frequent as time goes by. Also it connects with my devices randomly while all the devices bluetooth connection are disconnected. Now it turns on and off every 15 sec. I drove me crazy. I had to leave it in the basement until I return.  I read that some costumers had the same problem on JBL web site.  it seems like a common problems for this product. I tried to reset but it did not work. I asked for the technical help to JBL support but they asked all the  photo of proof of purchase, serial number, shipping address.... why? What if, I got as gift? I did not like how they treats. I decided to return while I can (3 mos). I did not like the sound either compare with my beats speaker. the sound if more like a boom box, not delicate.",2020,12
"Good sound quality, reliable connectivity, nice weight. I love taking my music to any room in the house, and outside!",2020,12
Sound quality is excellent. We play it for more than 6 hours a day and the battery life is great.,2020,12
Good product very nice,2020,12
"The bluetooth crackles and disconnects constantly, I think it came defective from the factory. Also sound quality isn't very crisp. Overall wouldn't buy this again. Looking into swapping the product out, or getting a refund if possible.",2020,12
No depth. Annoying to listen to.,2020,12
Excellent product. Very easy to setup and use,2020,11
Battery won't hold charge. The first one failed within 90 days and was replaced. The second one failed one week after 90 days and out of the support period.,2020,11
My teenage son loved this.,2020,11
Great bass and Rich and amazing sound,2020,11
Can't think of anything that I don't like about this unit. Sound is very good for it's size. Easy to pack around too.,2020,11
Sounds good so far,2020,11
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and it turned out excellent! The sound is as good or better than her old, clunky Bose that was twice the size of this. I highly recommend this product; it's great. The design, the buttons, and the performance have been awesome so far.",2020,11
Kids love this item,2020,11
"This is - hands down -  the BEST Bluetooth speaker I’ve ever owned. Do not even hesitate, buy it, it’s awesome. Just be sure to check where it’s coming from because there are a lot of fraudulent knock-offs out there.  Amazing speaker. I’d buy it again in a heartbeat...",2020,11
slim style with a punch of quality sound,2020,11
Not as loud as I would like it to be but sounds great and only sometime disconnects from my phone.* update sound quality has gotten worse a lot of static *,2020,11
The sound quality is A+! Battery life is awesome and is easy to connect to bluetooth! It's also easy to pack up and take trips with. I got the red one and the color is beautiful! The pictures does not do it justice. Overall great product by a great company!,2020,11
I used it in a warehouse while we were assembling Christmas Food Boxes for families in need and it made that Christmas music fill the whole warehouse.,2020,11
"Bought this over the summer and it was awesome, until it stopped working a week ago.  Not charging, not turning on, no connectivity....nada.  Nothing has helped get it working again and I'm sickened to be throwing away almost $200 on this piece of junk.",2020,11
Great! Amazing  sound,2020,11
"Does NOT come with a case, do your research so you don't have to spend alot more money for one!!",2020,11
Bought for Christmas gift — sounds great! Easy connectivity!Con: a little heavy but the good out weighs the one con.,2020,11
It was perfect my girl uses it everyday,2020,11
"Unfortunately, Bluetooth cuts out the audio high frequencies.  For a portable Bluetooth speaker, this is great.  My daughter enjoys listening to her music while in the shower (speaker outside the shower but isn't harmed by the humidity).",2020,11
The sound is amazing. A surprising amount of base. Love it!,2020,11
"Very loud and sounds super clear , bought this as a gift for my dad and he’s obsessed with it",2020,11
I needed a stereo for my boat. what I got is not only great sound but I can move it anywhere I want music,2020,11
Sounds great!,2020,11
This things awesome! No complaints at all.,2020,11
i love this speaker i had it for 2 years and its like its still new,2020,11
Great,2020,11
I am very impressed with the resolution of these speakers. I bought two of them. I highly recommend these speakers.,2020,11

No power supply included.  Disappointed children on Christmas.,2020,11
Love this speaker.  Made my daughter soo happy,2020,11
"So my JBL I've owned for about less than a month now and now the speaker itself doesn't charge at all the cords work with other devices just not the speaker... I assume JBL uses bad batteries for their devices, regardless this is unacceptable for a portable speaker at that price. TLDR; Just bought the speaker this month battery already having issues charging",2020,11
"To listen to music from different outlets. In my case from a MacPro, an iPad and an iPhone.",2020,11
Was good while it lasted - not even a year and the thing doesn’t charge anymore.,2020,11
This speaker has great sound quality and connects so quickly to my phone. I have used it a lot and haven’t had to charge it yet.,2020,11
"Everything perfect , arrived on time in perfect condition",2020,11
"ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I kinda bought this last year black Friday and it was 80 bucks when I did, but the bass is deep, I dropped it pretty hard once, but no problem. The battery lasts for a good but if you don't use it constantly.",2020,11
Speaker is constantly cutting in and out and makes it impossible to use. Very disappointed in the quality for the money!,2020,11
Great product,2020,11
"Big bang for your buck.Durable, waterproof and great battery life",2020,11
"i never dropped the speaker or put it in water, i dont know why the speaker does not charge anymore. i only had this speaker for about 3 weeks.",2020,11
sound is just OKAY. and yes the sound only comes out of the right side .. i initially thought one speaker wasn't working but after reading reviews it is correct that the main sound is only on one side.  Probably sending it back.,2020,11
I bought it for my husbands Christmas present but he cannot wait to open it and he is happy with it!,2020,11
JBL always a great product ..this is the 3rd one of their products we bought and love them. Great sound even in the smaller ones..always priced right.,2020,11
"The pairing between speakers is easily interrupted and interferes with.  They are constantly cutting out. Probably really only good for single speaker use and not pairing 100 of them together as advertised.Everything else about this speaker is awesome!  I through it in a snowbank last weekend after having it for several months, and it sounded great and continued working.  I figured if the pairing sucked, then I would start testing out the other features they advertise.  Water resistance was a successful test.",2020,11
"Depth of sound it’s just a notch below the Bose speaker I bought four years ago, but Bose quality has now gone down so I am happy with this JBL  one, although it is a bit bulky. It has a very long battery life, and gets very loud when needed.",2020,11
Best Bluetooth speaker I ever had!,2020,10
"Great speaker, lasts about 12 hours on full volume",2020,10
I love my JBL bluetooth speaker. I use it daily and really enjoy the music. It's a significant upgrade over my tablet speaker.,2020,10
"This was a gift for someone who is as familiar with the product as I am! I have used this speaker in a small ""public address"" capacity (as well as a personal listening device) and it performs wonderfully! Best ""bang"" for the buck! Highly recommended!",2020,10
"Great sound,  adequate volume.",2020,10
This is a replacement from an older style - love it!,2020,10

"I decided to start write reviews because of these speakers, literally when you get something from internet based on people reviews you should take this one seriously,  Base, Very load without losing quality,  the sound is incredible, fast connection, and very very long battery life and real waterproof",2020,10
Sounds great. Holds a charge for a very long time. Bluetooth connection was very easy.,2020,10
"plays loud enough to have a mini outdoor party, take it with me everywhere I go.",2020,10
great portable speaker that sounds great.,2020,10
This is by far the BEST portable speaker that I have ever purchased . I have another speaker that I thought was a good one but it was lacking volume and clarity once I compared it to this one !!! This unit keeps a long charge and can charge my phone also .,2020,10
Bought for a special gift. It was well received. .,2020,10
"SO FAR IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING WELL. Hard to connect with the blue tooth, I have to fuss. I wish the base was better. It's ok, but I would like more!!!",2020,10
"Very nice new JBL packaging with directions. It's normal size not small not huge. Looks just like the picture color is accurate. Comes with charger, takes a long time to charge. Overall JBL is my favorite portable speaker.",2020,10
My speaker is Not performing to it’s fullest Ability it’s too low.,2020,10
Works well but there is no way to adjust treble or base - sound quality isn't what we expected it to be. Used it 2 days with a variety of music and returned it.,2020,10
"I have owned this speaker for a year now and still love it.Pros:- Great volume and sound. Some of the best bass I have experienced from a Bluetooth portable speaker.- Very durable. I forgot the speaker on the top of my car at one point and this device finally fell off at around 40 mph onto blacktop and bounced down the road. I thought I had just completely ruined my JBL, but other than some superficial scuffing nothing was damaged!- I have used the speaker to play music in the rain and there were no issues.- The battery typically lasts over 12 hours with easeCons:- The volume tends to be to loud. The volume makes big jumps when clicked so occasionally I just can't hit that sweet spot. It also doesn't go low enough for quiet study music (at least for me).",2020,10
"Didn't like not receiving a charger cord which happens to be different from charge3,which I have two of &the charge2 I have 1 also no pamphlet or other paperwork! Seems like might not be new! Speaker itself works fine so far.",2020,10
My teenage son loves it.,2020,10
Great Christmas Gift,2020,10
Bought this for my daughter she really loves it. It can be very loud even when it's not at 100 percent.,2020,10
I was surprised about the great sound. It connected almost by itself with my computer. It makes my computer sound system sort of portable. Disappointed that the receiver sound stops as soon as I connect the JBL. Computer cannot send a bluetooth signal and a hard wired signal (to the receiver) at the same time. Maybe I need a new computer.,2020,10
Extremely satisfied!!! Awesome sound...pure quality!  This is my second purchase!,2020,10
"I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find out the charging adapter didn’t come with this speaker. It’s expensive enough, you’d think they’d include like they did for my charge 3. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and one of the things he loved about the aesthetics of my charge 3 was the vibrant charger! An adapter is something +90% of users will need.. why omit that? Great quality but I give this a 4 star for skimping on the charger.",2020,10
"The sound quality and bass is better than any Bluetooth speaker I have purchased before. I have had zero problems. A long battery life is key for a Bluetooth speaker. It says 20hours on the box but I felt like it went longer before I finally had to charge. I’m glad I spent a little more for a better quality speaker, this was worth it.",2020,10
"JBL as you know prides itself on high-quality sound. This company far exceeds anyone's expectations when it comes to great-sounding audio, and solid build quality. The JBL Charge 4 is a very rugged and tough water proof speaker that really delivers on high-quality sound.This portable speaker is great for any party no matter the type and it works great with any genre of music. When I purchased this speaker, I already knew what I was getting because I had heard this speaker inside a church where they had 3 of them going all connected together, and quite frankly, they sounded like a very expensive sound system. And due to the wide expanse of the church's sancturary, the bass resonated very well from the music, and all the mids and highs were also there. There isn't a bit of speaker hiss or distortion from these speakers no matter how many are connected.Oh, let me tell you about stereo mode. Now that is really sweet! JBL really knew what they were doing when they implemented stereo mode for these speakers because let me tell you. The stereo mode makes the music quite emerssive and realistic. JBL's sound signature is great, and it definitely deserves a 5 star reward for excellence and quality.The fact that you can connect 100 of these together means that you can have sound all around you if you like. Believe me, you'll be amazed at the bass that these little guys put out, and the great stereo mode when connecting two of them together. I listen to all genres of music, but my favorites are EDM, House and Trance, as well as Country, 80s, and  Soft Rock. EDM music really bangs on these. You will have your own version of the clubs when you use these speakers. Other genres of music sound great on them as well thanks to JBL's signature sound which is extremely clear and detailed without any distortion whatsoever. And, since today's music is all digital, you need that kind of sound because nothing else will do. The JBL Charge 4 speakers are definitely a 5 star in my book, and I urge everybody to get 1, a pair, or 100 of them if you can afford it haha!As far as a comparison between other similar speakers, these put Bose to shame. A matter of fact, they blow Bose clear out of the water! Bose ain't got nothing on these speakers guaranteed!Now Sony is a good runner up, but Sony has a small problem with sounding a little muffled in my opinion. I actually own the JBL boombox, and that monster really cranks out the bass and it is very loud! The Charge 4 speakers are also very loud too for their size which is why I am so impressed with them. I also love the fact that they have an IPX7 rating which means that you can put them in the water. Yes you can use these speakers in your shower. You could take a shower in stereo! Yep, a totally water proof stereo. Now isn't that something? Hey if you had a smart phone that was also water proof, the entire stereo system could go in the shower with you. haha! Hmmm! a new adult pool toy, your water proof stereo!So, if I were you, I would get these bad boys today, and let the party begin!",2020,10
Good speaker,2020,10
"It worked fine for the first two weeks, now it just stops playing music randomly, doesn't puase the music because the music on the phone is still going but you can't hear anything, I have to press play on the speaker. Hasn't been dropped or even exposed to any water even though its water proof.",2020,10
"i will avoid JBL from now on. sound was great until it broke, now dead, refund was no problem thats why i shop amazon!",2020,10
"great all around speakers.  Pack a punch, battery life long, great bass",2020,08
This speaker rocks!  You will not be disappointed.  Perfect size.  Charge last all day even at max volume.  JBL procts are the best.,2020,10
I GOT MY JBL CHARGE 4 AND IT WORKED WELL UNTIL THE BATTERY DIED AND THEN IT WOULD NOT LET ME CHARGE! DO NOT BUY!,2020,10
"What can I say? This is hands down the best waterproof portable Bluetooth speaker I’ve ever owned, and I’ve had a few. JBL has a household name for a reason, and rightly so. The sound is amazing, especially the bass. Great range, and even better battery life. The fact that you can charge your device from it is awesome, but the link feature has to be my favorite aspect. Link with your friends who have the same family of speakers with one button for multi source audio- I’ve got a few friends with them and it always enhances the experience. Also more than one device can pair simultaneously which is super neat. Highly recommended!",2020,10
I thoroughly enjoy this LBJ Bluetooth speaker,2020,10
Amazing sound quality - Battery life is horrible. Takes forever to charge. Might as well get a wired speaker. Great bass sound but that fact the the speaker is unusable due to battery life I give this a 3 star.,2020,10
The sound quality is awesome. So clear no matter how high the volume is!!,2020,10
"AMAZING Speaker! Honestly, my ONLY beef with it is that it doesn’t get quiet enough 😂😂",2020,10
Works great,2020,10
Lacks full sounding bass,2020,10
Really good speaker. Battery life is pretty good as well. Super easy to connect via Bluetooth and also to connect to other charge 4 speakers,2020,10
"Great sound. However, it didn't come with a charging cable! For $120 I expected a charging cable. But, it does sound great and it has an aux input.",2020,10
I love this thing. I live on cal fire center and all my buddies here love this thing. Definitely would recommend the sound on this thing bumps!! Battery life is great as well and best part about it is it charges your phone too if you connect it through usb!,2020,10
"just what i expected.  better than most cheap (under $50) portable bluetooth speakers.  As far as sound quality goes, its just ok.  honestly i was hoping it had better sound quality but it doesnt, but for a portable battery powered bluetooth speakers it meets expectations for the price.  low frequencies (bass) is ""OK"", mid frequencies are ""OK"" and high frequencies (treble) are also just ""OK"".  I would have preferred they made it not waterproof and had better sound quality - i don't really care if it's waterproof or not - especially if that feature is going to sacrifice the sound quality",2020,10
"Bought this to replace a little UE that i had.This speaker has NO bass, No mids, its loudest volume is nothing compared to my much smaller speaker.Returning this after one day.",2020,10
"Charge 4 has been great so far. Sounds great, Battery life after full charge is very good (2-3 days until recharge if that), Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, portable.",2020,10
Excellent music box for both sound quality and product quality. Nice looking too. Easy to carry around.,2020,10
Very fine bluetooth speaker.  Once again JBL builds a quality product.,2020,10
"The Aux on the JBL Charge 4 is poorly designed - the speaker will turn off between songs or podcasts if there is a delay, extended silence, or short period of low volume section, causing parts of the song to missed for a few seconds while it tries to turn back on. This creates interruptions if you are trying to listen to yoga or meditative music or podcasts. I have two of them with the latest firmware 3.0.0 and they both have this issue.It appears many others have already commented on this issue. Apparently, this was an intentional design by JBL to save power, but it defeats the purpose of the Aux port.The bluetooth range and party range is mediocre. You can't leave the room with your phone or it will cut out.",2020,10
Its great !Good sound quality and style !,2020,10
I’ve had this speaker for about 5 months and everything is great with it but I’m really irritated because one of the sub speakers have blown. This was a pretty expensive speaker and now that that blew it sounds really bad,2020,10
Great quality and good bass for a speaker it's size,2020,10
"everything about rhis speaker I love. You get what you pay for is true here. I bought a few different ones and borrows a few friends speakers and compared them all and this one is well worth the cost. The volume and sound range and clarity was noticeably better with this speaker compared to all the others. The battery life is great, I've had it at 25-50% of max volume for about 16 hours and it shows 4 of 5 LEDs lit. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for powerful portable speaker",2020,10
Seemed to work well and not muffled compared to my old speaker. I think most if not all of the reviewed have been accurate about the functionality. Able to connect well with any phone and no problems so far. Only had for a short time.,2020,10
Bella!,2020,10
Love it,2020,10
"Battery and charge functions step up from next model down in the JBL bluetooth speakers, sound appears to be same quality as model below this one. Heavier than lower model, bigger because of battery. If you don't need the features of the battery and charge options go with next model down in the JBL bluetooth speakers and save $ and less bulky",2020,09
over all is very good if you ask I love stereo sound.,2020,07
The JBL charge 4 is awesome! The sound is incredible. The battery life is amazing.,2020,07
"I have had the JBL Charge 3 for a while.  The sound is good, and what you would expect from a portable, waterproof, battery powered, bluetooth speaker.  Anyone who expects studio quality sound from the aforementioned probably truly believes the president they voted for in 2016 is as great as he thinks he is.HOWEVER, there is one flaw in the Charge 3 & 4 that no matter the sound quality or anything else will end the usefulness of this device. The charging port for the Charge is a type 3 and if you don't get the cable in the port perfectly EVERY time, it becomes damaged to the point of being useless.  You are then left with 3.3 pounds of useless junk.  JBL, for this type of product, how about a more substantial charging port.  BTW, what will you give me for 3.3 Lbs. of junk?",2020,10
JBL OVER PRICED BY FAR,2020,10
"Would totally recommend, can be used for personal listening or with a bigger group for chill hangouts/parties",2020,10
Love my JBL blue tooth speaker. I use it in my jet ski.,2020,10
"I LOVE JBL speakers. My wife has had a JBL clip for the past 4 years and I got this as a birthday present to replace it and let me tell you the audio quality is phenomenal. I use it in the kitchen while I cook and she uses it when choreographing dances. It is a great speaker and well priced. A JBL speaker will last a long time too, we still have the clip.",2020,10
Too Quality Sound and functionality from a reputable company at a reasonable price!,2020,10
Good sound,2020,10
"Battery life is great. Being able to use it as a charger for other devices, like to charge a cell phone, also a major plus. But where it suffers is the sound quality. As others have mentioned the mono speaker is definitely a weak point. Though the bass output is decent; for its size the speaker barely seems to get as loud as our flip 3. Also when connected via Bluetooth to our Samsung TV for is a quite noticeable lag in audio once again in comparison to the Flip 3.",2020,10
Very happy with item! All of our teens have this speaker and they all love them,2020,10
"It is a great product.Much larger then the flip from JBL, about 2 times the size",2020,10
"I have never dropped it or damaged it in any way, it barely leaves its shelf, I never listen on full volume- yet the quality turned to absolute poopoo within the past year. I noticed it actually after 3 months and it's been getting worse, the highs and mids sound sooo muddled and it hurts my ears because I listen to rock, metal, electronic, edm and others which are heavy on the percussion and need really good quality sound or it can be heavy on the ears. I'm literally appalled. I'm going to try to get it fixed by JBL hopefully they'll pull through and fix it because I'm really sad and I can't return it anymore ahh.",2020,10
Sound quality is completely garbage. DO NOT BUY. I don't understand why this product is estimated so high level.,2020,10
Excellent speaker,2020,09
It’s good for the price the sound it’s great and I like the party connectivity,2020,09
I purchased two JBL Charge 3 speakers one of them quit working within a month I do like the sound out of the smaller JBL Charge 3 better than the charge 4 also the charge 3 has a microphone so you can use it as a speakerphone.  The charge 4 only has one speaker so it is not even stereo.  JBL is very difficult to work with they sent me a charge 4 claiming it was better than the charge 3 for the replacement but it is not and you don't even get a charger to charge the battery on the charge 4.  If I was to do it again I believe I would stay away from JBL.,2020,09
"I've only used a couple of times so far, but the sound is great and the battery life is great! It was easy to connect with bluetooth, but I couldn't take my phone very far from it, maybe 20 feet.",2020,09
Speaker stopped accepting charge after two weeks. Continuously shutdown after a minute of use. Returned accordingly.,2020,09
"The photo compares the flip 4 (smaller) and charge 4 (larger). The charge 4 is well worth the extra $. It’s Louder, more bass and much much crisper sound. The Flip 4 sounds just like the WONDERBOOM - which is fine but not for really enjoying the range of sound of your music.  I haven’t purchased any other Bluetooth speakers so I can’t speak on how these compare to BOSE or other more expensive brands. For my needs in a 1 bedroom apartment— 1 of these in the bedroom, kitchen and bathroom works nicely ! Very easy to connect. Battery life is amazing. Does take time to charge but plays and charges at the same time. They connected to one another easily.",2020,09
"I listen to everything from podcasts to classical, rock, and metal on this speaker. It has a great full range including an impressive bass response. The treble is pretty directional and the sound isn't hi-fi for critical listening. I'm very happy with the small size and portability. I can carry this thing around the house or back yard and have my music wherever I go. Overall, I'm very satisfied!",2020,09
Not as good as the Charge 3 I have. Can’t get my two to sync. The 4 is not as loud as the 3.,2020,09
As expected sounds great.,2020,09
A+,2020,09
"This small speaker has just as good quality sound as my professional speaker I purchased for hundreds of dollars, easy to use and Bluetooth connect is rapid.",2020,09
Just received it and Love it already. Great sounds 👌 👍,2020,09
Very happy with this purchase and delivery,2020,09
"This is a fine speaker, but none of your USB-C chargers will work with it. That brings the score down to a 2 for me, it's pretty useless.",2020,09
"This speaker doesn't have a built-in microphone, so you cannot pair it with a phone. This is pants-on-head retarded.",2020,09
I used two charge 4 speakers in my workshop; wish JBL could make it so both speakers will turn off and on when one turns Bluetooth back on from the same device. It appears the JBL speaker does not remember after being turned off or disconnected that it was paired with another JBL device.,2020,09
"We are really enjoying our JBL Charge 4 speaker. We use it all the time, especially in the golf cart and hot tub. It stays charged for a long time and is easy to Bluetooth to my phone. We are very glad that we bought it.",2020,09
"Excellent quality, nice presentation, size very portable.",2020,09
Light weight but sturdy. Great sound indoors and out.,2020,09
"I seldom come back and write reviews. I've had a DOSS speaker for a while which is quite decent for its price, but this is just an amazing speaker. Really good sound quality!",2020,09
Love it!!!!!,2020,09
"The charge 4 is awesome! Great sound. Awesome bass. And w jbl connect, u can link up to 100 speakers!!!! And that's any model jbl speaker that has the jbl connect. Waterproof is really nice. I bump tunes in the shower and not worry bout messing up my speaker! I also purchased a silicone case that has a strap and now I can carry it over my shoulder. Really convienent for when ur out and about like the beach, outdoor event etc.  The only problem I have is that it doesn't have a microphone. microphone. Have the charge 3. It has a microphone. I use the charge 3 on calls all the time. I can be doing other work in a room and still have a fluent conversation with no hearing issues. That's a big deal for me. The 4 sounds a hair better. Now if it only had a mic.....",2020,09
"It charges very fast, battery lasts a long time. They still haven't designed a better charging port. The flap pushes on the cable causing weakness in the charge. I replaced my 3 for the 4 after the sound started getting strange, the 4 has the same issue.",2020,09
"Great looking speaker and the MONO sound is clear and loud. If you're looking for STEREO don't bother with the Charge 4. I'm unable to get my two speakers to play in stereo -- mono party mode only. I contacted JBL Support who said ""I'm sorry, but the Charge 4 is unable to play in stereo at this time. Our engineers are working on it."" And yet, they are still advertising as the ability to pair two speakers to stereo, with no timeline from the engineering department as to when. Looking for stereo speakers? Don't buy these!",2020,09
Discounted fornthe urine complexion but this speaks gets it,2020,09
Bring the party literally everywhere. I love thus thing. It's small but powerful so easy to cary and bring music to any situation.,2020,09
"Great unit, lasted 11 months before the battery suddenly wouldn’t hold a charge anymore. Still under the limited warranty so JBL will be sending me another unit",2020,09
"Fits in my golfcart cubby.  Sounds great.  Great for beach,  camping,  or anywhere inside or outside. JBL is the best name brand hands down.",2020,09
Gift,2020,09
"As I said before, I got this for my mom for her birthday because she always uses my grey charge 3 and loves it!",2020,09
The color was great!!Better than I expected,2020,09
This product is amazing,2020,09
"I have a smaller JBL speaker and really enjoy it, so decided to get the JBL Charge 4 as an upgrade.  This speaker was surprisingly disappointing!  The Bluetooth function was terrible.  I couldn't get a consistent listening experience.  It would cut out, despite updating firmware, switching Wi-Fi networks, forgetting and reconnecting the Bluetooth.  I ended up returning the product.",2020,09
"Awesome speaker, the base is great!!",2020,09
"First one sold me. Great sound, easy connectivity, great look.",2020,09
"Love love LOVE this thing! Even at low volumes it has a full range of sound. I own an older Bose sound link mini, whose sound it also superb, but this Charge 4 has a far louder range. Bought it for around the home use and our annual trips to the Philippines where things tend to get wet on the beach. Being quite waterproof, that shouldn’t be an issue with the Charge. The Bluetooth connects easily and quickly (no toggling on and off to get it to work as with some older Bluetooth speakers). I haven’t used it long enough, but the battery shouldn’t be any sort of problem at all since it’s a 7500mah (which means it’s allowed on planes!). Overall, extremely pleased.",2020,09
Just great sound for such a small speaker!  Haven't tested the waterproofness.,2020,09
"I read so many reviews and went back and forth on whether to get this speaker.  Now that I've heard it's sound quality, I'm so glad I decided to go with this Charge speaker.  The sound is amazing and the battery last forever.  I take it with me on the golf course and people wonder how this speaker can generate such great sound.  It's a little bigger than others but so worth the extra punch you get from the sound it generates",2020,09
this is the best speaker ive ever had. its super good.,2020,09
Good job,2020,09
I love this Jbl speaker!! It has really good sound and it plays super loud!!,2020,09
With in 2 months battery die,2020,09
This speaker sounds fantastic and has a great look.  I thought it didn’t come with a charging cable but it is actually in the back of the box in a thin cardboard sleeve.,2020,08
This speaker is great. The sound is so crystal clear we were in disbelief the first time we used it. We love taking it to the beach and my fiance always takes it golfing with his friends. The only thing I would change is to make it lighter. It is somewhat heavy and bulky. I wish it was thinner and lighter.,2020,08
"Has deep bass, but wouldn't mind a bit more treble. It sounds great outdoors and that's without turning the volume all the way up. I did have some trouble setting up the stereo mode but I figured it out. We play this whenever we shower, plus when we're getting ready, and we charge it like every three weeks or so. It only takes an hour or two to fully chargeFor Stereo mode: Pause the music and make sure only ONE speaker is connected via bluetooth. Press the connect button on both with the app open. It'll show both speakers together and you can tap stereo below it.  It will NOT work if both speakers are connected via bluetooth - it has to be just one and leave the other unpaired",2020,09
I purchased this speaker because it if the name and thought they made great sounding speakers.  That is not the case with this speaker.  I guess I should spend more money to get the quality of sound I want.,2020,09
Woke awesome. Very loud,2020,09
"I love the sound of this speaker deeply! But the connection range is weak as hell. 12 feet away you start to lose connection. Volume wise between 70% and 100% it’s the same sound it doesn’t get louder. I love how it looks a lot, i love the sound but the quality of the sound isn’t there for me. I’m a little disappointed but it’s a solid speaker all around.",2020,09
Very nice color.  Best speaker I ever owned. Sounds very nice.,2020,09
Amazing sound and great portability!!,2020,09
It looks & feels like a top quality product.The sound is very good.,2020,09
No speaker better,2020,09
This is the second JBL Bluetooth speaker I have bought. I used to buy Bose but the JBL sound quality and battery life are awesome. Bose is a great product but JBL is the way to go for the money,2020,09
Sounds great!l long battery,2020,09
great sound,2020,09
Love it!,2020,09
Long lasting battery; good sound quality; always connects to Bluetooth!,2020,09
I love this this thing! Take it with me where ever I go. And it can charge my phone. I recommend.,2020,09
I wanted something to take when playing sports seeing how big it was I was expecting it to be at least a little louder has the loudness of speakers half the size and a quarter the price,2020,09
It has wonderful sound and a very long battery life,2020,09
I had the JBL charger 3  So I thought that The 4 would be even better because longer batter life. But I was wrong the charge 3 had better sound quality clear sound and great bass not so with the charge 4 so I sent it back. And bought something else. ☹️,2020,09
"This speaker has a really good sound quality, it’s very easy to use and you can carry it everywhere",2020,09
"Love this. I take it on my paddle board, bring it outside when I have people over and bring it all around my apartment. The sound quality is amazing. It can get pretty loud too. Love that it’s waterproof sine I spend a lot of time on the lake.",2020,09
Love it,2020,08
Bought as an upgrade for my flip 4.Same volume level. Maybe a tad more bass and battery life. Returned item and kept flip 4.,2020,08
Love this speaker.,2020,08
"The sound quality is amazing. It’s perfect for all the activities I do outdoors. Within 24 hrs of its arrival I took it along on a hay ride and had it playing while out grilling, outdoor chores and bonfire. Love it.",2020,08
"I bought the JBL speaker May 27, 2020 and have listened to it daily for hours. The sound out of the box was waaay heavy on the base. I found a sound mix app online and used the app to adjust the bass down for a more realistic range. It sounds good.  Now for the impressive part...I perched it on the top of my shower enclosure listening to my fav Pandora station. When you guessed it the speaker dropped 7 feet to the shower pan.. bounced a good foot and landed getting drenched. It was amazing.. never missed a beat. But it gets better.. I didn't learn from that experience and did the same thing, AGAIN (ops)! Second 7 foot fall, bounced, did four 360 degree flips in the shower, and keep on playing.I will definitely buy another one when I destroy this one!! JBL sounds great and indestructible. Chris",2020,08
10/10 its awesome,2020,08
Good sound! Exactly like pictured! A little pricey!,2020,08
Great replacement for the small Bose portable speaker that I had. Easy to link with Bluetooth and the sound is excellent. Highly recommend.,2020,08
"I bought this as a birthday gift for my mom, she said she wanted a portable speaker with great sound. I found this gem and I’m very impressed. It arrived quickly and my mom tried it out right away (so glad it came charged btw) Connectivity was fast and easy. Sound is AMAZING!! She’s in love with it and I’m thinking of getting myself one as well!",2020,08
I’ve had this for about a year or two now and this thing is sick. Sound quality is amazing and I couldn’t be happier. I didn’t want anything too small or too big and this is perfect for taking out and about. It comes with a sling but I’ve never used it. Before getting this speaker I’ve never owned a JBL product and was somewhat apprehensive. I have the blue color because I couldn’t find the green camo. At some point I’d like to get the next size up but for now this will work just fine. I’ve seen JBL products range from $50-$500 and depending on what speaker it is I would totally buy it because I have fallen in love with the brand now.* I bought this at my local Best Buy - not on Amazon.,2020,08
"Love the size, feel and color of this speaker. It was very easy to connect to my phone and I've been quite impressed with the sound quality. Even more impressive is the battery life of this speaker. I can go days to weeks without charging depending on how much I play music. Like that you can charge your phone off of it too!",2020,08
"Perfect, about 3 years with this and still having the same quality",2020,08
"Broke in two months, purchased new from Amazon. Wouldn't power on. Amazon can't return it because it was month over expiration. Should of had a 6 month/ year warrenty. Great product when it worked.",2020,08
Signal works at great distance!!!,2020,08
This has been awesome for sitting around the pool area. Not having to worry about it getting a little wet. The sound is fantastic. Highly recommend.,2020,08
"I live in the country and host or go to a lot of bonfires and outdoor gatherings. We discovered a while ago that having a radio wasn't good enough, between a lack of music selection and constant commercials. The JBL Charge 4 is a perfect party speaker solution, and I'm going to leave my impressions based on that use.The speaker is plenty loud if you're on a deck/patio and it's placed several feet away. You'll even need to turn it down to have normal conversation. It doesn't do as well at our large outdoor fire pit, because of the bigger distances and lack of surroundings to close sound in. That space is about 20 feet from a bench on one side of the fire pit to the other, and in an open yard. The speaker is still good, just not great if you like loud, commanding music as I do. If there is a larger group of people (like 8-10+) speaking at once, for example, it will not be able to overtake their voices, and will be reduced to background music. It will also be affected by a big bonfire - the waves of heat will actually distort the sound on the opposite side of the fire.The sound clarity is good. Bass is nothing crazy, but tight and does not distort or sound hollow. As noted earlier, volume really depends on how small a space you're using it in and how many people are talking, but even in the big, open outdoor area, it's perfectly loud with only a few people. Most importantly, when turned all the way up, it maintains a clear, clean sound and does not get distorted like other sound systems/speakers do when you push them. I see some complaints about it being a mono speaker but it sounds fine to me for what it is. If I want unparalleled sound, EQ customization, and other features, I'll buy true audiophile equipment.Bluetooth is easy to connect and a lifesaver technology in general. If you have a cellphone with enough bars and this speaker, you can play as much music as you want. Bluetooth will stay connected at a good distance. I've walked about 30-40 feet from the speaker and had no issues. Not many people would be streaming music very far away from the speaker, I imagine, but it will tolerate a reasonable distance.Charge time is definitely optimistic. It's advertised as being 20 hours but I've not gotten close to that. Fully charged and playing continuously, at full volume, connected via Bluetooth, I've squeezed probably 4-5 hours out of it, which is still plenty. I often just let it charge from an outdoor outlet while playing music.The speaker is definitely waterproof. I've left it outside in the rain a couple of times. I also let it sit on a plastic chair with a recess on the bottom. It rained overnight and I came out the next morning to find it submerged about an inch or so in a puddle of water where it had sat for hours. Powered right up with no issues. I'm glad I tested its abilities, but hate to abuse/neglect any of my stuff like that.If you're doing something similar to me - gathering several friends around a chimenea on the patio, or sitting out back by the fire pit - this speaker is awesome and will be louder than you want when cranked up. If you're looking to entertain a large group of people who are going to be noisy, it's not the best choice but who's really listening at that point anyway.",2020,08
"I upgraded to the Charge 4 and I must say, the Charge 2+ sounds way better. Thinking about returning my Charge 4 in favor of the Charge 3 due to it not being a stereo speaker, but mono like everyone is saying. Also, the Charge 2+ has crisper sound.",2020,08
This charge 4 is really great in terms of sound quality and battery life.... I'm glad I got it for my traveling back to Nigeria.,2020,08
"These speakers worked well for a couple of months. I play a lot of music so I had to charge them (I have 2) at least once a week. Last week one of them would not power down no matter what troubleshooting I did. Today, the 2nd one wouldn't power up no matter what I did. After doing some research, apparently the power button is an ongoing flaw with this product. My speakers are still under warranty so I am going through the process of having them evaluated and hopefully replaced. However, being my first experience with JBL speakers, which I thought would be bulletproof, I'm sadly disappointed.",2020,08
As soon as I got it1. Never would shut off2. Was barely louder then my jbl flip 53. Noticed awhile ago that no sound comes from the right side of the speakerIdk if this is just a faulty system or if its every speaker but for the money paid definitely not worth it,2020,08
"Love the red, it won’t get dirty easily. I purchased a white before that, and realized the plastic on the sides and bottom will turn yellow over time, so ended up returning the white.",2020,08
The sound quality is perfect and the battery life is efficient for a small speaker. Bluetooth connectivity was great.,2020,08
I had one and had to get another,2020,08
"Love, love, love this speaker!! Great sound and battery lasts forever!",2020,08
"Perfect for a day at the beach or river or anywhere. .A bit bass heavy, but I am partial to that. SURPRISING bass response for such a small unit. Charge your phones and still bump all day?!?!? Who made such witchcraft!",2020,08
This JBL is great when sitting around the campfire.,2020,08
Greatest sound and durable,2020,08
Great quality and sound for the price,2020,08
This speaker is OUTSTANDING! Sound is GREAT! Very well built! I am gonna buy another one for sure! Highly recommend this product!,2020,08
Easy to use! Has great sound quality and battery life! The blue tooth is also easy to connect and use.,2020,08
Have had multiple JBL speakers. Never disappointed.,2020,08
We got this for my son's birthday and it has been a great speaker. He uses it with his friends all the time on the back of his truck and we have used several times around the pool. The speaker is plenty loud enough to hear over the equipment and it has great bass response for such a small package the battery seems to stay charged forever and we have not had one single issue with Bluetooth connectivity. I also like the fact that you compare this with other speakers to have a true surroundsound when you're out with your buddies or at a party.,2020,08
Great product! The sound is amazing and the battery last all day. Would recommend,2020,08
I was skeptical about buying this given its price. But I got a discount during Black Friday and bought it. The sound quality is amazing. And connectivity is easy.,2020,08
great product used it on the beach all summer long never failed load clear and crisp. loved it. we now have 2 one for me and one for me Daughter.,2020,08
"For the price, not so great. I’m disappointed seeing the good reviews and not hearing the delivery. I apologize for a bad review but I expected better than this for the price. Size is good to take anywhere.",2020,08
I love it! could be a tad louder tho,2020,08
The sound is amazing. For such a smaller product it produces a lot of sound.,2020,08
"Easy to use, easy to transport, amazing sound (both quality and volume)",2020,08
"I want to start with, i have owned many many many portable speakers in my life because im pretty rough on them, i go racing with them and they get kicked around and covered in dirt and mud and get thrown and all kinds of stuff, but this speaker is by far the best sounding and best quality Bluetooth speaker ive ever had. Its been run through the mill and used every day for multiple months and its still just as good as day one. Very nice battery life also. If you’re in the market, buy this one.",2020,08
Used them all summer in stereo operation with the JBL App. WOrks well. sounds great.,2020,08
Sounds is perfect,2020,06
"I love the speaker and have  one already.  In this case I  had to get one for a friend with AMZN for a specific reason, but the price charged $179 is grossly over priced.  I could have gotten one at Walmart for $130 all day long, but had to use AMZN for a friend.  Why does AMZN allow this level of gouging?  Other wise, perfect speaker for my purposes.",2020,08
Very loud for such a small speaker. Clear sound.,2020,08
"Got this on sale, great value",2020,08
mine would not charge so once it died that was it i had to return it,2020,08
The speaker is clear and has great sound quality. iPhone connectivity is a big plus.,2020,08
"I rarely ever give a poor review on anything but I am very disappointed in this product. The internal battery will not take a charge. I have tried other cables and charging boxes. For the price I paid for this we should expect that it last for years, not months. I purchased the speaker on May 23, 2020 and its now Sept 26, 2020.",2020,08
"Great for the first month. I got 3, now one of them sounds like crap, buzzing on the bass even at moderate volume. I don't blast it, either, so I figure it must be build quality.Update: a second one has gotten flaky after running the power to zero *once*. It is usually plugged in all the time as a speaker for my Amazon Echo, and got unplugged when furniture got moved.Disappointed that a ""flagship"" company like JBL would have such poor quality.",2020,08
"As described, great product",2020,08
The JBL is a good speaker but when you have the audio go up more than 75% the bass levels start to fade out. That is a common problem for JBLs but it still works good,2020,08
"I’ve had this baby for about a year, probably more. Sounds as good as day one. Perfectly water proof in the shower, battery life feels infinite. Bluetooth connectivity is smooth and fast. I adore this thing. Only thing to note is that when you charge your phone with it the battery is drained pretty quick, but it charges surprisingly fast.It’s not gonna be enough volume for a large party, but for a get-together with friends its more than plenty. You can hook up additional speakers if you need extra juice anyway so it’s not even a problem.The mono speaker doesn’t feel mono at all. Everything sounds on point",2020,08
Light weight with great sound and battery life.  Don't expect reference series sound but for a portable speaker to use with a cellphone or tablet it provides great sound.,2020,08
I play it 8 hours a day at work and charge it once a week👍,2020,08
This is a powerful little speaker.  It easily connects to so many of our devices.  The battery life is long and the sound is great!  Very happy with this purchase!,2020,08
My fav speaker ever!!!,2020,08
"This was a gift for my boyfriend and might be stealing it from him xDIt sounds really good indoors, we haven't tried outdoors yet. The sound is clear and the bass sounds great. I was worried because of the comments saying that is mono, trust me that is not even perceptible, it sounds great.We are not party persons so we have not thrown a party using this speaker, we connect it to the tv, laptop or mobile and watch movies, tv shows or listen music. For these type of uses is perfect.",2020,08
Great sound,2020,08
Great  quality sound easy  to connected to devices,2020,08
"Very poor sound, little to zero bass, poor app support, and a miserablr battery life. If you are using this for outdoor or warehouse usage, it will disappoint. Full charge this morning granted 6.5 hours of play at 80% to 90% volume. Quite far beneath the 20 hours promised. If it had lasted 10 hours I might keep it, but the sound just isn't worth $180. Metal music sounds terrible and you have to put your ear up to the speaker to hear it at 100% volume. How does this garbage get passed off as premium stuff? Returning it immediately and taking the leap to Bose.",2020,08
I link it up to my for TV box while streaming movies.  I use it in my car because my stock stereo is horrible.  I love it more than any other speaker I have ever used,2020,08
I really enjoyed listening to the Audible Booktrack books on this speaker.  The background music and sounds are so clear yet not overwhelming the reading of the books.,2020,08
"I'm a professional musician and spend a lot of time listening to music with a critical ear. I didn't expect much from the JBL, but I was surprised at the sound quality pumped out by this compact unit. Connected to my phone effortlessly. Good bass tones and definition in the highs. Gets pretty loud, too. Highly recommend for when you want music away from your home base.",2020,08
Best Speaker ever,2020,08
"still cant figure out the connect feature, but super great speaker on its own. The power bank is sick.",2020,08
Decent bass good battery life not quite as loud as I was expecting but over all a quality speaker just don’t make the same mistake I did and get a white one they get dirty easy.,2020,08
"My husband uses this all the time. We have used this almost daily, inside and outside. It's quite loud! No weenie tin box here!! I'd actually like to get one more so we can sync them up and use them in two different areas! Hopefully soon! I hear that the new version won't sync with the older model so please keep this one available!! :)",2020,08
I bought the Fli4 a few years ago to take with me when I travel for work. I wanted something a little bigger for use around the house and this speaker was a great choice. Great sound quality and great volume for around the house. Easily pairs with other JBL products also.,2020,08
Works great and has great sound.,2020,08
Disappointed for the 3rd time!,2020,08
I absolutely loved my speaker the sound of my music gets me pumped when I’m doing work so I definitely recommend it,2020,08
"I have a Charge 3 that I use on a daily basis and loved it so I decided to purchase the latest version (Charge 4) as a birthday gift since it was on sale for the same price as the Charge 3. That, unfortunately, was a big mistake. I read the reviews about the mono speaker issues and they were spot on. We played the Charge 3 and 4 right next to each other and the Charge 3 had a much richer and more immersive sound.Do not spend the extra $60 for the Charge 4, save your money and get the Charge 3. I promise you won’t regret it.",2020,08
"Great speaker for my teenager. Buy the custom case for it.  Great sound. Better than smaller, more expensive speakers.",2020,08
Battery only last 6 hours ....and not really that loud,2020,08
The sound is amazing!! You can even charge your phone. Its incredible,2020,08
I cant believe how amazing and loud this speaker is.  We use it outside on our pool deck and the music carries incredibly far and its not even turned up all the way,2020,08
Very good speaker with exelent sound quality,2020,08
We are really enjoying this speaker! The connectivity and sound are great!,2020,08
Sounds great! Even better in a drywall corner. I have had it about two months and the deep ness of the sound is unparalleled.,2020,08
Superior sound quality well worth the price! It rocks out the fire pit area in my backyard perfectly!,2020,08
Great,2020,08
"Junk.....ordered 2 of these. At no time did I have more than 1 that worked. Returned twice hoping for replacements that actually worked. In the end I returned both, suffered the restocking fee and bought Bose.",2020,08
Not only does it sound awesome but the one thing I like about it is when you leave the range of the Bluetooth and come back it turns back on. Just an awesome unit,2020,08
"This speaker is the best ever! I had the smaller version of this speaker prior and the battery life was basically nonexistent even with a full charge so I needed to upgrade. I decided to go with this speaker and I'm so happy I did. The batter life lasts FOREVER. I literarily never charge it, or very rarely do, and have yet to have it die on me. The sound quality is outstanding, it gets super loud without compromising quality AND you can even charge your phone with it. Amazing speaker.",2020,08
Quality sound easy to set up great speaker,2020,08
Love!,2020,08
Very good sound for its size. Loud enough and at top volume it still has clear sound.,2020,08
I only had this speaker for less than a year and it stopped charging. This is my second (and last) JBL speaker. I am staying with Bose for now on.,2020,08
This speaker is a great purchase it sounds wonderful charges easily and has a Great Sound,2020,08
"I have bought the clips speaker 2 & 4 for working in the yard and to put on my golf bag. I also purchased JBL big 3 and JBL charge 4, all are excellent speakers. I can connect 3 &  and 4 large speakers not available for clips.",2020,08
Excelente,2020,08
"I love this speaker. So many good things to say, battery life is great, sound quality is awesome and the think I like the most is the Bluetooth range. I have not seen any other device with such an impressive range. I am now building an ABS pipe mount for my atv so that I can just stop the jbl in and ride away.",2020,08
Gave my husband this for his birthday & he loves it!!!,2020,08
Absolutely love everything about this speaker.  Great sound and connects well.  It even says waterproof.  Well we accidentally dropped it on our hot tub and it still works amazing.  So I give it 5 stars for a very good speaker,2020,08
"This speaker is perfect for outdoor or inside parties. The bass is good, the sound quality is excellent. Very good portable speaker.",2020,08
"I’ve owned the Beats by Dr Dre, and it’s bigger, heavier but cannot compare in any way to the JBL Charge 4.  The bass sound is excellent, the size is perfect and convenient to carry from room to room when you’re doing Housework. Bluetooth is strong too. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because it doesn’t have a remote.  But I’m totally blown away by the sound quality.",2020,08
"Very skeptical at the beginning. Did Lots of research on competitors. Let's be honest--this is not going to replace a total sound system (if that's what you are dreaming of), but this speaker goes from room to room (and outside) and gives sound that is of high enough quality for you not to feel like you are missing out on something better. I bought this for a family member first, saw how good it was, then bought one for myself within the same week. Battery life is great. I would definitely recommend this.",2020,08
Yep works excellent love it would not trade it for nothing,2020,08
I’m no audiophile but I have been amazed by the sound quality of this speaker. I’m hearing subtle sounds from my classic rock tracks that I have never noticed and this compares to both Bose wave and their portable brick. A friend has the 3 version and I think this has a better sound. The range is superior to any of the bluetooth speakers I have used and I just realized I can keep the phone close because of the 4s charging capabilities. I don’t know if these other reviewers were expecting live philharmonic sound quality because this speaker is awesome.,2020,08
"Love it - battery life is awesome - as is sound quality!! Thought about buying something bigger, especially for the price, but glad we didn’t!!",2020,08
Its nice and loud but some times I have a bit of static in my music could just be my phone,2020,07
"This is based on this exact unit, I was going to return it but was to busy in the time frame. I have the same unit purchased from someone else and the sound quality is better and the way it runs is better. This unit cuts out often out of nowhere with a full charge and the sound quality is worse than the other charge 4 green that we own",2020,08
"I’m obsessed with this speaker. Not only is it the perfect size, but also I didn’t have to compromise the quality of volume or sound. It gets so loud, and it’s still clear. I have recommended this speaker to lots of my friends! Also, the grey is such a good color. I love it!",2020,08
"I literally have 0 complaints. I use this at work, at half volume both the kitchen I work in and the kitchen connected to mine can hear the music. The reason we put it at half volume is because at full volume, you can hear it all the way throughout the lobby from the back door of the kitchen even over all the sounds of the ovens, timers and customers talking. Hands down would recommend this to anyone.",2020,08
"The quality of the sound pleasantly surprised me.  We were going to use it just for camping but because of the option to recharge my phone, I take this everywhere.",2020,08
I was slightly reluctant to buy because of the price but it was worth every penny. Even hooked it up to my 70” TV and it completely changes any movie to near movie theater quality right in your home without the expensive set ups. Love how portable it iswith a long battery life to boot. It’s a daily use for the warehouse I work in for all the music we play at work.,2020,08
"Great product, very happy with it’s performance. Blue tooth connects flawlessly. You can pump it up to a Strong loud sound,  clear and crisp",2020,07
Great sound,2020,07
Speaker After a week it has sound problems not satisfy with the product,2020,07
Really good sound and also charge your phone,2020,07
Sounds great and is very portable,2020,07
I loved this speaker as long as it worked but I’ve had it only for one year and the speaker is blown. Is there a warranty?,2020,07
"Gift for family. The love it. Pool party, camping, and outdoor fun.They love the fact that they can charge their mobile devices from the speakers",2020,07
This speaker worst speaker I have ever bought and I took it in the water once and it broke and I’m pissed that this is 200$ and it’s already broken,2020,07
"It works better than the Bose SoundLink Revolve I used to have.  Better sound quality, to include more bass.  I can hear the music throughout my backyard.  Glad I purchased it.  Recommend you do as well.",2020,07
Nice speaker and good sound. Uses usb c to charge but only cord provided not the plug. My wife bought a tribit same time this has much better sound,2020,07
"I just received my charge 4,  but no usb charger came with it.  Do this supposed to come with a charger or just the speaker itself? It’s ridiculous if it’s just sold for the speaker only and you have to to buy a charger separately.",2020,07
It broke? Only had it a month and rarely used it. The hell!!,2020,07
"Charger not included. It’s a good speaker, but I wish the battery life lasted a bit longer.",2020,07
"Arrived in a broken package that was ripped, wet, etc. The amount of money I spent on it, should warrant a decent product. Not thrilled that I waited a week to receive a garbage product. Very irritating, and very disappointed overall.",2020,07
"Great sound quality for the medium size speaker, if you want more bass and louder sound go with the xtreme series and smaller get the flip. I returned my flip for this one because I wanted a louder sound.",2020,07
"I find the JBL Charge 4 to be exceptional in all respects and recommend it highly. I am somewhat baffled, however, by the wild jump in price surrounding my purchase. I bought it for $119.95. It was not on sale. Three days later the price had jumped to $179.95.  I don't think the original price was a mistake because that was the price for the product in all the different colors offered. A 50% jump in price seems extraordinary. Is it worth $179.95? In my opinion probably but that is for you to decide.",2020,07
"The absolute best Blue Tooth speaker money can buy!Crisp clear sound with hard-hitting bass, can charge your smart phone and can withstand being submerged in water.I got a great deal on this bad boy and bought the coolest color available. So much power in a small body, JBL continues to deliver!",2020,07
Jbl speakers are the best in terms of Quality/money. It's my 3rd speaker and they are great!,2020,07
I’ve had the flip 1 for 6 years just started going out so I hope the longevity is the same for this one. Obviously the sound quality between flip and charge 4 is way different but instantly impressed. Love that now I’m able to charge in the truck now. Definitely makes some great sound in about 400 sq ft. We use these as a kitchen speaker while we cook. It’s amazing have had this for about 2 hrs. If any severe inconveniences come along I will update this. Jbl has been a long favorite of mine.  Btw I’m an audiophile and have installed at least 25 car audio systems.,2020,07
This product is amazing. The color looks great and stands out. Battery life is impressive. Only problem and reason not to give 5 atar is the fact this product doesn’t include the plug in ac USB port only the cable.,2020,07
"The sound isn't as good as I had hoped, but the awful range of the bluetooth was the absolute deal-breaker.  Fully charged, it can't keep a solid bluetooth connection to my computer that's literally 20 feet across the living room.  It breaks up so bad that it was unbearable to listen to.  Wondering if the problem was actually my computer, I switched to a little JBL Clip 3 that I have, and it worked flawlessly.  The Charge 4 was a total failure and is being returned to Best Buy.",2020,07
"Love it, I been use it at the pool, riding my motorcycle, for bbq, connected for mo it’s outdoor of my patio... love it!!The only cons is the JBL app, no equalizer, option to add play list... the app is useless.But the espeaker it’s amazing, waterproof!!! Love it love it.",2020,07
wish it was a bit louder works amazing though,2020,07
Outstanding speaker with amazing base for the size. Linking to a second or more speakers is a fun party favor.,2020,07
Compact and extremely loud when needed,2020,07
We love love love this speaker! Great sound! Great battery life! I love that it’s water proof so no worries at the beach or pool.,2020,07
"I have a smaller JBL and loved it so much, so I decided to purchase this one as well. I love, love, love this JBL. It has just the right bass too.",2020,07
"A fantastic speaker for my laptop which I use to watch movies. I can also have it in the rain, but have not tested that yet. Good price excellent sound, and the battery life is amazing.",2020,07
Love my Jbl they make awesome speakers for any occasions take it everywhere and battery life last 20 hours n some 😀,2020,07
"My new go to for great sound quality at all volumes, portability, and nice design. Bought with the silicon holster and the travel case. Using it indoors with my tv and to stream music, at outdoor events, and camping.",2020,07
Product seemed to have been previously opened. The plastic bag that is usually covering it was missing . There were no manuals included in the box. Other than that it seems to work alright. I expected new and properly packagedRay,2020,07
Worth all the praise and the moneyEdit:  battery does now,2020,07
"I'm in a small space so this thing is REALLY loud which is great. Lots of bass, also great. Not so much if you're looking for quality highs and such. I'm really happy about this purchase. Unless you're a music sound quality critic you'll be happy too.",2020,07
I would’ve liked it to be a little crisper sounding,2020,07
Only lasted 7 hours when fully charged. Quite disappointed with this product overall.,2020,07
"portabe, durable in all types of weather conditions, nice balance of high, mid, and low end frequency",2020,07
"Only way I listen to my music now, other than when I walk.Easy to use. Great sound.",2020,07
"I don’t see where they get 20 hour battery life, thing didn’t even give me 7 hours, good sound quality though",2020,07
sc,2020,07
"This thing works great if you keep it plugged in. My speaker has sat on the charger for over a week now and is less than half charged! I think I got a lemon, my brother has this same speaker and his charges full overnight.",2020,07
"I am so happy with this purchase. I can't believe what a great sounding portable speaker this is. I love this speaker so much that I even just got a case to protect it. Not that it needs, but it's built like a tank. And the other great thing is that it can even charge your phone if you need to. But man; awesome sound! I think it's a good price for it.",2020,07
We can now enjoy great music while swimming in our pool! Just what we were looking for,2020,07
I dislike that the volume doesn’t increase according to the Bluetooth device. I would like if the UBL Volume could increase in sounds.,2020,07
Got this for my son he likes it,2020,07
"Great sound and work well in the party mode with 2 or more speakers. Battery life is good, but if you like your music loud, don't expect more than 4 hours of play time.",2020,07
I like everything about  it,2020,07
This is a very good little system for the price holds a charge for a long time and sounds really good at reasonable volume,2020,07
"I bought a ""like new"" speaker, but before I made my purchase, I contacted the seller and basically asked why the product was classified as ""like new."" Their response: ""Item is inspected and 100% functional. There's a 30 day return period."" I took a chance; the only reason I didn't give a 5-star rating is because my speaker arrived VERY POORLY PACKED; I consider myself lucky the speaker is of such superior quality/durability, because delivery people don't make a habit of handling packages carefully, and the ""protection"" provided amounted to some shredded foam (from an original box) thrown-in a regular shipping box with the packing bubble wrap. EVERYTHING had shifted in shipping; there was no effort to secure the bits of packing material to protect the unit. And, it arrived with NO user manual or operating instructions of any kind. I had to go on YouTube for a tutorial, and to JBL's site for a manual download. So, 5-stars for the product itself; actually, I'd give the shipper 3 stars, but I don't want the overall rating to reflect poorly on the product itself. JBL is THE TRUTH!",2020,07
powerful speaker great sound,2020,07
Doesn’t hold a charge. Lasted however long the battery was charged for initially and that was it.,2020,07
I LITERALLY just pulled this speaker out of the box. Turned it on and paired it to my iPhone. Sounded amazing then I went to charge it and it turned off and it won’t turn on at all. Tried all the troubleshooting steps and it’s still dead. WHAT THE HELL???,2020,07
"I bought this speaker 2 days ago from this comment date, I used it with its initial charge worked well. Then I tried to charge it it never charged. I saw many similar problems about this speaker on reviews, some faced this issue after a month and they can't return it.I'm happy that it happened within 2 days.Won't trust this brand anymore.",2020,07
"In my opinion, if you dive too deep into YouTube reviews regarding decibel comparisons etc. etc. you'll never end up buying any speaker...  Keeping it simple; I can tell you this is an awesome portable speaker for it's price range.  I take it to the community pool, BBQ's, outdoor family events and it's perfect!  Long lasting battery, good bluetooth connectivity and packs a pretty good punch in both volume and bass.  I would maybe consider the larger JBL Xtreme 2 if it goes on sale, but in all honesty this Charge 4 is perfect for what I use it for.  Portability to me is more important that a little higher volume and bass.  Love the speaker!  Well done JBL.",2020,07
I’ve had my speaker for about 3 months now. The cord got really messed up and stopped charging the speaker and it would take 2 days to get it to 2 of the charging bubbles fully.I had it charging the whole day and it only got to 1 bubble icon fully.,2020,07
HS Grad gift.  She says she loves it.  Great sound range and quality.  The one to have.,2020,07
The seal was Brocken already It was supposed to be used? It looks really new,2020,07
Awesome product good sound and appearance as to be expected,2020,07
I love the sound quality,2020,07
Sounds great. The sound is well balanced. The single speaker instead of stereo is not an issue at all. Great build quality also.,2020,07
Great,2020,07
I am not impressed which is odd because I’ve owned a few JBL products and they have been nothing shy of amazing. I have 2 JBL 3rd generation now that have far better sounds quality than the 4th gen. It won’t stay connected to blue tooth when the 3’s never have that problem. There is a feature with JBL that allows you to hook up to 100 JBLs together. Guess who’s won’t stay connected? Mine!!!! It’s so annoying and I put in a return for the item but got very sick and now can’t return it at all. In my opinion it’s a waste of money. You are better off get something else.,2020,07
We use this on the boat and the beach.  Brother has one too and they will connect wirelessly with no problem.  Waterproof but will not float without an extra buoy.,2020,07
 I love it for the pool and parties. I love the colour and the quality of the sound. Previously I got a Bose but I preferred to give it to my mother and keep this green one.,2020,07
" My first JBL speaker, I was surprised and pleased at the sound quality. Clear sound with great bass. Battery life is incredible, I charged it once and took me the entire week with great sound.",2020,07
I have owned MANY JBL speakers..... THIS one is the worst! It cuts out ALL the time I love my JBL Charge 3....I wish I would have bought another 3.......,2020,07
This was what I needed for my backyard get together’s .,2020,07
Great speaker!,2020,07
We really enjoy this speaker for outdoor dining on the patio,2020,07
"Always loved these speakers and always will. This one you're paying for more vocals than bass, still maginifico!  Only problem was my connectivity issues.  When I first got this speaker, I could walk through my house with no problems.  Now, 5 months later I cant go 10 steps (literally) out of range from the speaker without it skipping.  Overall still a great speaker",2020,07
Can't pair any device because the Bluetooth button is not working.,2020,07
"This is a great speaker with great battery life, and great Bluetooth connectivity to our Samsung S10 and a Chromebook. And the JBL app does firmware updates over Bluetooth. Love it.The reason for losing one star is its charging behavior. I bought this to have it in one location, constantly connected to a charger and to only carry it around from time to time running on battery. For some reason, the speaker charges fully, the 5 LEDs indicating the battery level go out to indicate that it's fully charged, but then after some time, the LEDs turn on again and the 5th LED starts blinking to indicate that it's charging, and stays that way. All this while the speaker sits there connected to the charger without being turned on. The LEDs are very bright, which makes it more annoying.",2020,07
Love it,2020,07
I got this speaker as a gift and he loves it. The sound is incredible!,2020,07
Awesome quality,2020,07
"I love it, just like the description!",2020,07
Just love it!! Well worth the money!,2020,07
Works great and is easy to connect to.,2020,07
"I got the Vifa Reykjavik and although I would say at the mid level, the sound quality is identical: clear, bold, and good bass, this JBL blows the competition out of the park at the higher volume settings. No distortion or loss in quality. The speaker is built well and looks great, too. Worth the money, I think.",2020,07
"I generally don’t give five stars unless it’s something I extremely love. But this little bar of sound is totally awesome, amazing, extremely worth the money! This tiny little Bluetooth speaker is amazing. It’s super small but the sound is pretty loud. It’s very portable and you don’t have to constantly be charging it even at max volume. We have two big Sony speakers that can light up a party. They’re also wireless, but they’re extremely heavy and take up a lot of space and they are way too loud for public reunions. So we decided to get this JBL portable speaker and it was the best thing we did. It’s portable because we could take it camping, to the beach or pool or lake and the sound is great! And even if you drop it in water or juice it continues to work amazingly!",2020,07
Bought for my son as a present. It fit the bill and was actually more than he expected. Did price comparison and it beat the competition hands down.,2020,07
The speaker skips so much that you can’t listen to the music. Extremely frustrating. I am a major JBL fan so this is heartbreaking!,2020,07
"I love it!! I bought this for my mom because I already have one of this brand so I know it has a really good sound quality. The battery lasts for long and you can be using it while charging and the quality still the same. Really easy to connect to your phone by the way, it only takes a few seconds. Hope you enjoy this product as much as we do.",2020,07
"I use this guy all day every, literally. I work in remodel and I have it playing from 7:30-5:30 and then use it at the weekend to for grilling out, on the boat or riding my bike. Sound is great, good bass for a little guy and gets loud enough for what you'd need from a speaker this size. Easy to charge and last a long time, I only wish it would tell you when the battery was low with a noise and not just die on me.",2020,07
Last weekend I took this speaker on a floating trip down the river. I know it said it was waterproof but let me tell you..... our tube flipped over and the speaker was MIA. 45mins later we found it floating down the river. Picked it up and started playing music again. I was Stunned!!!! Awesome speaker.,2020,07
This is top quality and the sound is very good. Battery last long and charging other devices is easy,2020,07
"When I paired with my iPhone 11 pro max with 1 speakers ok but when I tried to paired to speaker the connectivity or bluetooth fail some time, this happened with Samsung and its worst.",2020,07
Decent speaker. Way better upgrade than my other “ihome” speaker. The ihome speaker lasted me about 5-6 years and still works so let’s see how long this one will last.,2020,07
"This speaker gets surprisingly loud and has decent bass frequency response for its compact size. Overall, the highs, lows, and mids are all very well balanced for all music styles. Definitely waterproof on account of it being near my pool with kids. Very pleased with this product.",2020,07
Very good product,2020,07
The style is nice and the sound quality is great!!,2020,07
Really like this speaker. I use it in my house and outside and the sound is great. I love that it’s waterproof (resistant or whatever) because I use it on a shelf above my shower and don’t have to worry about the steam ruining it.,2020,07
Bought this for my husband’s birthday.  He loves it!,2020,07
Great quality! Waterproof and very durable!,2020,07
"Sound quality is great and so is the waterproofness, but I have two JBL Xtremes and they cannot connect via JBL connect with the Charge 4, apparently the Xtreme is connect and the Charge 4 is connect+",2020,07
DOES NOT PAIR WELL AT ALL WITH JBL CONNECT.I bought this to connect to my jbl boombox. It paired and did the whole JBL CONNECT. WHICH JBL SPECIFICALLY OFFERS. It worked for about a month then started having problems. Connection was lost in a minute. Distortion. I even had them just a foot apart and still dissapointing. Buy it for solo use. Not for JBL CONNECT!!!!!,2020,07
This is well worth the money.,2020,07
The JBL speaker is excellent--everything I hoped it would be.,2020,07
"Overrated, definitely can tell it's mono sound quality. I would get the sony with fuller sound and Ldac quality. I regret choosing this over Sony due to a deal. Not worth it.",2020,07
Works great! Would buy again,2020,07
Not loud enough,2020,07
"perfect timming, price and comm!",2020,07
"I use it to teach classroom music.In some performing venues the volume is loud enough.Great feel in the hand, convenient.Attractive, unobtrusive design.Beautiful sound.One drawback:  JBL stopped providing charging cube, so you have to own one already or charge through USB.",2020,07
"Loud and clear outdoors up to 150' away but don't expect a lot of bass. Its there but not deep. The speakers are on the ends and just aren't large enough to move that much air. However, the SQ is very good. Love that the battery lasts 20hours. Its light weight and easy to transport. Great addition to our camping trips.",2020,07
"As expected, great sound, easy to use",2020,07
Love these products. Super good brand,2020,07
Like being able to keep phone charge while using speaker,2020,07
No charger cord? For what we pay there should be,2020,07
Great quality,2020,07
It is amazing I’m buying the boombox,2020,07
I like this because it’s loud enough for me to listen to the music,2020,07
It's kinda heavy but very durable.  Sounds fantastic.  Love it.,2020,07
First off I would like to say I love this speaker. It's sounds amazing for the price. And battery life is very good..sit has a 1 year warranty to which I had to use on my first one and have no complaints. The battery quit charging so I looked up the warranty and email them had no problems getting it replaced. So my gripe is with the battery longevity life. I use mine everyday where I work and I'm getting about 3 years out of this product. But what do I know I'm not a battery expert. So for the price of this ..you can't go wrong.,2020,07
So.  I’m at work and my buddy has the FLIP 5 $99.00I have the CHARGE 4 $299.99THEYRE THE SAME IN VOLUME.  I’m upset because this scheme cost me $200 more. AND I HAD O BUY THE CASE SEPARATELY.  BUCOCKY!!!,2020,07
"This item exceeded my expectations! It is a good size but not too large to handle easily. The sound loudness and clarity is excellent. We own the smaller version that we have been pleased with, but this one is great for outdoor use. I would purchase this again.",2020,07
"Dope! Brought it for my girl and she loves it. Its super clear and loud, not much bass (but what do u expect for the size and price point) id recommend it, great for pool and beach days",2020,07
Not sure yet if the price justifies the product.,2020,07
We use it in our RV great sound.,2020,07
Nice product at a fair price. I like it loud and it is plenty loud.,2020,07
"My Granddaughter and I picked this out for her 20th birthday.  She wanted simple, great sound, to use at college and didn't want to be afraid to take it to a beach.  This speaker provides all of that.  Bluetooth pairing of her iphone with the speaker was simple and quick.  The speaker's sound is incredible and doesn't disappoint even when the volume is at the highest level.  Already took the speaker to the beach without a worry about water or sand.  There is 1 charging port on the speaker to charge a cell phone.  One comment on color.  The color Pink comes in many shades, and we weren't too sure where this Pink would land on the spectrum; however, the color is beautiful.  It's a soft shade, kind of a ""powder pink"", and even nicer than its picture!!",2020,07
"Excellent device. Very good sound quality, battery life and Bluetooth connectivity. Quick delivery to Colombia.",2020,07
Fantastic sound and small enough to take anywhere,2020,07
We have 2 speakers for stereo.  We love them.  Good quality product.,2020,07
"I love this product its quality, it came in really fast. And I love the sound I take it on my paddle board all the time ❤❤❤",2020,07
Great little speaker for outside.  We take this speaker with us to the beach and camping. The sound is decent and i love how rugged it is is plus I don’t have to worry about leaving it out in the rain.  I know that there are speakers out there with better sound but the price of them is also a lot higher.  As for camper and beach life this will do just fine for me.,2020,07
"I use it for my iPhone, Toshiba TV, & my projector so I can have movie night outside but I haven’t hooked it up yet to my projector so far it’s worked great with my TV and iPhone. 👍👍",2020,07
"We have the JBL Flip 4 and the Charge 4 that are able to sync together and provide coverage over the whole apartment, so that we can listen to the same thing in the kitchen, in the study, in the living room, in the bathroom or on the deck. Syncing is easy and intuitive, volume control on the secondary speakers is controlled individually, and you can ""pause"" them without interrupting anyone else's listening. Or, we can individually Bluetooth to a speaker, and listen to different things. Or, we use the speakers to amplify laptop sounds.These are perfect, simple to use, and easy to understand. We are so happy with them!!",2020,07
Live this speaker! Got it brand new for $130 and has great sound. Live that I can charge phone on it too.,2020,07
I use this listening to music and broadcasts in my back yard and for podcasts from my phone.  I like it so much I am considering getting a second one so that I can enjoy true stereophonic sound.,2020,07
It’s only played for 4 hours today at the beach I was so disappointedEspecially after it says it runs 20 hoursThat’s a lie,2020,07
"Bought for my wife, she loves it. She sets it in the driveway for working out, volleyball courts, the pool, and everywhere else. Sounds great and is loud enough for any situation.",2020,07
Sounds great and charge lasts longer than other speakers I've owned. Awesome has built in phone charger as well,2020,07
Great speaker,2020,07
Sound is very good for a single speaker with excellent bass response. An adjustable EQ vis phone app would be nice but still sounds great. Where this thing shines is battery life. I’ve had it for a few months and am still working on the first chafe and I use this speaker daily.,2020,07
"Love our new speaker but 2 downsides. It’s not as loud as we figured it would be. Good sound indoors but not nearly loud enough outdoors. Also, sometimes it connects to a phone first try, but other times it takes much longer and is very hard to connect (same with pairing it to another JBL speaker).",2020,07
I love sound,2020,07
"Replaced an old JBL speaker which only lasted 2 hours. The battery and sound quality of this JBL Charge 4 speaker is outstanding, and highly recommend it! Battery lasts for 20 hours.",2020,07
"Great speaker...cost, waterproof, battery, audio....great speaker.",2020,07
Awesome,2020,07
My 5 year old Bose Sound Link sounds better than this. Battery life is all this speaker has going. It’s a single speaker that comes out on one side only...POS!,2020,07
The sound quality is excellent. Charge capacity is incredible.,2020,07
I love this speaker and use it everyday.  Its my second one as the first one only last 1-1/2 years and then died.  Got extend warranty with this one.  Bought the same exact one as my last one.,2020,07
I like the size of this speaker and quality of sound. It also holds a charge so well! Pleased with the pricing for a great product. We Bluetooth from our phone & enjoy streamed music for hours!,2020,07
Absolutely Love this speaker. Quality product!,2020,06
"I realized I was spending more money on cheaper, less effective speakers. Finally invested in a JBL, honestly I don't regret the $$ cost. Its by far the best speaker I've ever owned. I bike a lot and love to use hammocks at the beach I always have it hanging on a strap. you can hear it from a long distance in a loud environment. DO IT! PURCHASE it!",2020,06
"Like that this product is waterproof & camouflage, that’s about it. The JBL Charge 3 is a better product I thought the 4 would be an upgrade but in my experience in less than a year the speaker now won’t hold a charge. My Charge 3 I had had excellent sound & long battery life & only crocked because the charge port became loose after years of hefty use. Very displeased by the fact I have to constantly charge the 4 & the sound quality doesn’t seem better either. I’ve only used the charger the 4 came with too & with the 3 I was able to use the universal android which was handy.",2020,07
Love this in every way! I didn't expect it to be so clear and have such nice bass. It holds a charge pretty much all day. It's perfect!,2020,07
Love!! It came several days early and I am so pleased!! My only grievance is that it didn’t come with a charger box -_-,2020,07
Bought this to replace my 7 year old bose soundlink portable speaker.  The bose speaker seems like it has an overall better sound quality but battery life if far better on the jvc and the jvc is much louder.,2020,07
Great sound !!!! Perfect size !!!! Excellent bass !! Easy access to blue tooth !!!,2020,07
"Battery life is incredible (12+ hours for sure), speak has nice sound quality and can get very loud. Plus it's waterproof which comes in handy just in case or when out on the boat",2020,07
The sound is amazingly good. Did not believe good sound could come from this sized speaker.,2020,07
Super speaker - love it!,2020,07
"My husband has one, son two, and mom one. These are best quality ever. And are very versatile in that you can connect them all to each other or just use one or two. Highly recommended if you are looking for a portable speaker. You will not be disappointed.",2020,06
"This speaker is built so horribly. Ive had it less than a month and since the second it was delivered it was broken. The speaker will not turn at all unless its plugged in. Once on, none of the buttons work and you CANNOT turn the device off unless you hold the power button for a minute. And even then, it randomly makes noises. But then once its off again, you CANNOT turn it on unless plugged in. Eveything about it is broken and frustrating, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. and no they will not offer to fix/send a new one. TERRIBLE",2020,06
"We should have saved our money spent on cheaper speakers, and just bought this first.  Great sound quality!",2020,06
"LOVE!!! small, easy to take along and the sound is great!",2020,06
"Works great. Only cons: what that had handle or space for hands to go when carrying, wish they had more bass, and Bluetooth connection to connected speakers goes in and out. With that being said, 4/5 stars",2020,06
This speaker really sounds great - good battery life as well.,2020,06
It’s boom like a crackhead hittin the pipe!,2020,06
I was not given a charging cord with this speaker,2020,06
"Cleanest bass in the $100-$200 Bluetooth speaker out of 5 I tried. I tried the doss $80, Bose SoundLink 2, jbl flip 5, jbl charge 3, and megaboom 3. Out of all these, the jbl charge 4 had the cleanest bass and clearest vocals without distortion at large volumes.",2020,06
I bought this as a gift for my son and he loves it.,2020,06
"Where to start! I purchased this to use at an upcoming BBQ/pool party we were having with approximately 15 guest. When it first arrived I fully charged it (no wall charger included) connected to bluetooth, it was working fine for the short time I used it. The day of our party it would play for a short time and stop, but was showing it was connected to bluetooth. It was very frustrating having to stop what we were doing to try to figure out the cause, never figured it out. The sound quality was subpar, lacked in bass, and at times distorted. The overall sound was mono, not what you would expect for the price and an upgraded model. Also, you will not receive any of your phone notifications when using the speaker, so you need to keep your phone with you. We ended up having to use an old bose speaker so our guest would have continuous music without the constant interruption. Would not recommend the charge 4! A couple of our friends own the charge 3 and it sounds and preforms much better than the 4. Returned",2020,06
"So far, a great sounding speaker. Very well balanced sound, most of the middle that comes out of it is crisp and clear. Good, punchy bass. Clear treble. Well defined mix for most music styles.",2020,06
Great sound,2020,06
No dislike love it,2020,06
Sound is amazing 😉 love it,2020,06
"Super Great sound, and durable, great for the beach, any family outing. We love this speaker!!!",2020,06
Love it!!,2020,06
Perfect size and most of all excellent sound!,2020,06
Excellent all the way around. So happy I ordered another one. It is great as well.,2020,06
Love this speaker it’s the best portable one I’ve had yet and I have bought many speakers,2020,06
Excellent,2020,06
"This speaker works great, good sound quality and it’s overall looks are very pleasing. Would recommend to anybody interested.",2020,06
Excellent sound,2020,06
Obsessed with this speaker. Great sound quality & volume level! Charges my iPhone fast and still maintains plenty of battery life! I’ve taken this speaker on a kayak and still works perfectly after getting wet and bumped around.,2020,06
"So far this has been an impressive speaker. I use by the pool, in the garage, on patio. Anytime we want some music outside. The battery hasn’t dropped below two lights out of 5. I have used for up to 5 hours and recharged an iPhone 8 from 10% to 65% and still had three lights on. The time I got it to 2 lights when I had it playing close to 10 hours on and off outside. The bass is good when you are a short distance away and the volume moderately high. When you are right next to it, the bass response is a little odd with the bass expander or resonators sounding a little rubbery.  Once you get a a little distance it sounds great. Especially next to structures. It makes the bass sound better. Bluetooth range is fantastic. Easily 20-30 feet outdoors with no obstructions. Also the splash proof features makes it safe for the splash zone next to pool. In the garage it’s really good while working. BT connects within seconds. I recommend.",2020,06
Great sound. Easy to use. Happy with our choice!,2020,06
I used this product to listen to music,2020,06
"It's just great in everything! Good sound, waterproof, great bluetooth connection. I definitely recommend it!!!",2020,06
Love JBL products. This is a great speaker good size nice to look at very stable. Nice sound output,2020,06
The mid and high range is a bit lower than expected however the bass levels help compensate to deliver a good sound. This is fantastic for the back patio and beach.  Battery life span ha snot been fully tested but in uses has thus far drained my cell phone faster than the speaker. The port in back can help charge as well,2020,06
Love it!!!,2020,06
Amazing!! My father loved it for the poolside! Easy to connect and has a long range so it doesn’t cut out when people the music player walks inside with their phone to use the bathroom!! Ten out of ten!!,2020,06
"This speaker is great! Wonderful sound, easy connectivity to Bluetooth, mostly long lasting battery life.",2020,06
Perfect just perfect,2020,06
"Perfect speaker! Loud, clear and it sure bumps for the size.",2020,06
We brought this to the beach with us and we use it outside while we are swimming.  Perfect for us.  Sound is great we love it.,2020,06
"Absolute great product. Sound, ease of use and portability is amazing.",2020,06
"Portable and long battery life, we’ve used on float trips, parties, in garage, Fir the size it sounds good and base is good too. Sold my big speaker and stereo system in garage it’s plenty loud. Will be buying another one soon when they go back on sale. Bought mine in Dec 2019 for $99.99.",2020,06
I've owned JBL speakers since the 70's and have always been totally satisfied.,2020,06
Great sound and battery life. Definitely worth the purchase!,2020,06
"I love this speaker, so glad I purchased it. Highly recommend!",2020,06
"My husband and I purchased two of these speakers and are thrilled with them.  The sound quality is fantastic and when they say they are waterproof, you can believe it!  We took one of our speakers out on the boat with us and wouldn't you know it, a passing wake toppled it right into the water!  We had to turn the boat around to go grab out of the water and the speaker never lost sound nor suffered any damage whatsoever!  The entire time it was in the water (about 2-3 minutes), it never stopped playing the song as it was floating !  Although an unfortunate incident, the speakers held up, continue to operate, and needless to say, we highly recommend them!",2020,06
I bought this item a few weeks ago and it was disappointing to find out the battery does not even last 30 min at full volume. But the worst part is that even if plugged to the charger the battery will die if speaker is in use which will cause for it to shut off.,2020,06
Was going back and forth trying to figure out which JBL speaker to purchase. Finally “settled” on the Charge 4 (because all the JBL products are great) and it has been the best purchase that I have made. The sound is great and it’s a very loud speaker for its size. Would recommend to anybody in the market for a travel speaker!,2020,06
My husbands bday present he loves it the sound is amazing,2020,06
Product is easy to use and has great sound quality,2020,06
Ok all,2020,06
"I've had this for a year. Just took it to the beach for a second time. Got it wet. Got sand on it. Works perfectly. It can bump as well but the mids aren't super clear if you care about that. My guess is most of you dont, but I do, so I took off a star. All together, this is a 5 star device and if you want to annoy your roommate or put it in a backpack and ride downtown with the volume all the way up you totally can and your phone will probably die first. unless you rode the bike. 5/5 would purchase again.",2020,06
"Works great, especially like that you can have two Bluetooth devices connected  simultaneously",2020,06
Love this speaker. Great quality sound and battery life. Worth every penny. My only small complaint is I wish there was some type of hook to secure it when on the river.,2020,06
"2nd time is the charm.  1st one wouldn't turn on if not plugged in.  Even when plugged in, turned on and paired, no sound comes from it.  It was a paperweight.  I  requested a replacement and it works great.",2020,06
It serves the purpose of playing loud clear sounding music,2020,02
great sound,2020,02
I'm not going to lie this is probably the most awesome portable speaker I have ever had in my Life.  The battery lasts like 20 hours and at links with other speakers which is awesome.  My only problem is I don't Li had it 2 months and it already stopped taking a charge.  This is my 2nd jbl speaker to do that.  So I don't know if it's just a product problem or what but if it wasn't for that I would have given this 10 out of 5 stars.,2020,06
"I bought my charge 4 May 24th, used it about 4 times and the speaker won't respond it won't turn off or play. Not worth it.",2020,06
This speaker is amazing. Well worth it’s price!,2020,06
"Nice little speaker. Worked right away, still haven’t had to charge it after unboxing and playing 4hra so far.",2020,06
Well worth the money a little bigger so it is louder and links up easily with other jbl speakers,2020,06
An awesome speaker!,2020,06
Very impressed overall,2020,06
Sound is not as pure and clear as I’d like,2020,06
Banging speaker. Great sound and loud.,2020,06
I researched a lot before buying this speaker and honeslty jbl did quite a spectacular job . The bass is satisfying ( even more than its rivals ) the distortion is not not present at all . The outdoor compatibility is too good to be true . Just be careful not to puncture a hoke in the side radiators (though its quite hard to ) .,2020,06
"Slight upgrade from the charge 3, it’s actually noticeable. It was a present for my brother in law and he really enjoyed it. I might have to get myself a charge 4 now.",2020,06
Sick sound,2020,06
Not great battery life and not for loud listening.,2020,06
This Portable Bluetooth Speaker is really great for outdoors. Very loud and great sound quality. You can charge your phone from it. The Bluetooth connection has a wide range. I would definitely buy again.,2020,06
Perfect size. Perfect sound. (for its size). I take mine everywhere and have been using the JBL portable speakers for many years now. Never been disappointed! Will continue to buy them. And I recommend them.,2020,06
I am enjoying my speaker,2020,06
Drain batt.very fast,2020,06
I love it,2020,06
Muy nice,2020,06
Excellent blue tooth speaker,2020,06
So loud! Love it! Worth the money. Connects easily,2020,06
Great,2020,06
Great speaker for indoors and outdoors.,2020,06
This is a complete upgrade from the Flip 4 and the battery life is so much longer,2020,06
Sound quality is not very full. Thought this thing would be louder with more thump. Not impressed. Durable and battery life is great. 2 stars.,2020,06
"Very nice Bluetooth speaker with fantastic battery life. The sound is clear though I would appreciate a bit more bass to balance the sound. Overall a very good, high quality speaker.",2020,06
"Love this speaker, would definitely recommend buying this one.",2020,06
"I was on the fence about purchasing a portable speaker as I'm typically underwhelmed with the sound quality, but this I dig. Out of the box it was lacking a little, but after EQing with my phone it is punchy and exactly what I am looking for. Large enough to carry the tech needed to produce quality sound, small enough to carry around or even throw in my bicycle bag to listen while riding. Not much I can complain about here. If I save up the cash I might buy a second one to get stereo sound, but I haven't honestly missed it that much. Buy one!",2020,06
The Sound And the bass quality is better than beats pill+.,2020,06
Really underwhelmed by this and the Charge 3. Not a lot of clarity and Bass seemed too heavy. I was far more impressed by the Flip 5,2020,06
Awesome.  Great bass and sound.,2020,06
Awesome superquick,2020,06
This speaker is very worth it. I had it in our family room and it sounded like we had surround sound. I highly recommend this speaker over any other speaker. Very good base as well.,2020,06
I absolutely love it!,2020,06
"Incredible speaker! I am having some Bluetooth problems, not sure if it’s my phone or the speaker itself but it’s amazing! You won’t be unsatisfied!",2020,06
"I have both of these speakers, and I like them both. Here's the long and short of it so you don't have to research a million reviews.The Charge 4 is larger, louder, and has more bass. I like this one because I don't care about the miniscule differences in quality of mid/high/low that won't be noticed anyways since this is a speaker for pools, parties, etc.The Charge 3 is smaller, less expensive, and has a ""truer"" sound where the quality comes across as slightly, but noticeably, higher. It's not as loud and doesn't have as much bass as the Charge 4, which sounds noticeably less authentic than the Charge 3.Unless you're a tech guy, the deal with drivers, mono vs. stereo, etc. doesn't matter all that much.Do you want a louder, bassier speaker that can be heard from a further distance, on a bike ride, around a campfire, etc.? Get the Charge 4Do you want a truer, more authentic sound at a lesser price? Get the Charge 3.",2020,05
Great sound. Take anywhere weather proof.,2020,02
"I originally gave this product only 2 Stars due to difficult Bluetooth connection with my laptop. There's a learning curve. I figured out how to change settings and am now using it regularly.I like it. I use it in the backyard in a remote area without cell service or internet.*end of changed review*My music collection is largely on my HP laptop. iTunes does not interface with BlueStacks. So I can't use the speaker for all my music.JBL Connect uses a new Bluetooth that requires Location Access.I bought the Charge 4 to use on a wooded property that I build Mountain Bike trails upon. There is no cell service in the woods.I can't interface with iTunes.I can't use this product without internet if I want to use JBL Connect with the new ""BLE"" (which I was not familiar with prior to purchasing).This is clearly an urban, Android related, cell service or internet service reliant device. It's worthless to me because of my unique desire to go use it outdoors without these services.I imagine it's great for streaming services but I'm extremely disappointed with its limitations.Other people have left very bad reviews for the JBL Connect app.Nice idea that will probably work well with your cell phone in an urban setting but then I've plenty of other options when I'm not outdoors.The product is both under thought and over thought and I find myself in the middle with a very limited functionality.",2020,06
Its not big but has big sound. Great to take anywhere to listen to music.,2020,05
It exceeded my expectation. We love it and could practically take it with us whenever we travel..,2020,05
The volume output of this speaker is disappointing.  Even at max volume it seems quiet.,2020,05
It didn’t work for more than 5 minutes after I tooo it out the box.,2020,05
1 star just for the misleading title.Maybe the public is too ignorant to realize that waterproof and water resistant are not even the same discussion.,2020,05
"Update: May 2021 - The speaker started crackling and became unusable.  Fortunately it was still under warranty and JBL was very responsive in handling the return and repair.  I just hope it lasts!This is my second JBL Bluetooth speaker.  I also have the Charge 2+ which I am very happy with, however,  after 3 years, the battery no longer holds a charge.The Charge 4 has excellent sound quality at the high, mid and low ranges. I bought both the Charge4 and UE Megaboom 3 for comparison purposes.  No contest... JBL was the superior speaker for sound in my opinion.  The UE speaker wins for features as it comes with a great App that allows for a more customized sound and user experience.Sound quality is what I care about most so I kept the JBL and returned the UE.",2020,05
"My brand new jbl doesn’t charge even once. A hard reset didn’t work, getting a new charging cable didn’t work either. I had it replaced for another one, and faced the same problem again. Not worth replacing again especially given the unreliability of the battery. I’ll probably get a Bose or Beats.",2020,05
If you dont own any go with the charge 4 its super reliable sounds amazing the bass is incredible also last a long time even while charging your phone. Really impressed with the product. And yes its loud!😂,2020,05
The sound quality is awesome!! Worth the money. Love it!!,2020,05
This speaker sounded awesome until it didn’t.  Started turning off on its own.  Spent tons of hours troubleshooting.  Called the company and they couldn’t even find my device by serial number.  They were completely useless.  Offered me a 10% off coupon to buy another piece of crap speaker.  This speaker was a gift.  I will never purchase a JBL product.  There are too many other products on the market to deal with defective equipment and piss poor service.  Don’t believe me.... google reviews for JBL pulse.  Tons of issues. Buy another brand.,2020,05
"It’s a great product and easy to use, and also very portable and reliable",2020,05
"It has the charging cable, but where is the plug for the outlet?",2020,05
"Was my daughter's birthday present, she is extremely pleased. Thank you very much.",2020,05
"Use the charger cable in edge of the box (inside thin black box that looks like a spacer). Do not use an Apple MacBook charger with its USB-C cable!  Does not charge when connected to Apple MacBook charger with its USB-C cable.Sound quality and volume are great.  This speaker does barely squeeze into my bicycle bag that mounts to the handbag on my bike.BUT, after I put the speaker, then I pack extra bubble wrap inside the bag, because the speaker to round, and tends to rotate while I ride my bicycle. When the speaker moves so the buttons are in the down position, and I hit a bump on the trail, then the speaker turns OFF.",2020,05
"There si not the product that i bougth. Is  not a JBL is a MegaBlast, and i Cant use for my other JBL speakers.",2020,05
"I read A LOT of reviews across many sites as I was trying to select a portable bluetooth speaker for pool days in our back yard and also for our river camping trips.  The Charge 4 is waterproof so even better for our two primary uses.I was originally going to go with Ultimate Ears Megaboom speaker until I read about the JBL Charge products and I'm so glad I did.I'm pretty particular about getting quality sound our of my home speakers, computer speakers and headphones and I'm very happy with what I hear from the JBL Charge 4.  For it's size the sounds is amazing and very ""full"" with good bass, but not overpoweringly so.If you have an Amazon Echo of Google smart speaker the sound from the Charge 4 blows those away.The Bluetooth syncing is super easy too.  If you've ever had bluetooth syncing issues with other devices you know the irritation I'm talking about that comes from that.  The Charge 4 sync'd to 3 of our phones with ease.Definitely worth your consideration if you're looking for a portable bluetooth speaker.",2020,05
"Exactly what I was looking for Lake side, bike rides",2020,05
"this is my second charge speaker, they have nice sound, portable and water resistant.",2020,05
"Solid speaker, and sounds fantastic, but doesn't sound all that far off from the great sound of its predecessor. Only upgraded only because I had thought the sound would be improved by a considerable margin. Waterproof feature was also a big reason why I needed one, as this sounds incredible in pool scenarios. Asides form that, not upset that I bought this speaker.",2020,05
"Several years ago, I purchased a pair of JBL Charge 3 speakers to use around our pool and was immediately in love.  I would connect one to my phone and then link the pair and have nice even sound all across our pool.  The range was great, the sound was great, and the batteries lasted a long time.  We eventually wore the batteries out and decided to replace them with a pair of JBLs latest ""Charge"" speakers, the Charge 4.  The sound quality and other features are the same, but the instability and sensitivity of the bluetooth connection and ""link"" feature are so bad, they are unusable.  I have to have my phone within 6 feed of the speaker for the bluetooth to connect, and they constantly cut out, loose their connection to each other, or pick up static.  It is so persistent, we are not using them anymore.  I deeply regret buying these speakers and wish I would have spent less money to but the far superior Charge 3 speakers again.  If you plan to connect two or more speakers together, stay away from these because they just don't work.",2020,05
This is a great device. Easy to setup and use right out of the box. Excellent sound. I am using it outside as I work on a big construction project - makes the work go much easier!,2020,05
"Great speaker, provides good sound and lasts a long time. The reason for the star deduction is because the battery didn’t last as long as advertised. I took it on a float trip and it died about  8 hours in. Granted I had it turned up max the entire time and it was a hot day but I think it should have lasted longer. Also the sound on the float wasn’t as loud as I would have liked. It was incredibly sturdy and portable. No complaints there.",2020,05
Solid design and sound to fill a variety of spaces.,2020,05
The speaker sounds amazing it looks amazing I brought it to the beach the other day said it on the beach and went out into the water and could still hear it for quite a ways. My boyfriend has two that we have a Velcro mounted to our boat and honestly I think two is too many because it is super loud.But all around if you were looking for a small portable loudspeaker this is exactly what you’re looking for.,2020,05
Perfect portable speaker for your back yard & going on trips! The sound is great!,2020,05
Greatest decision I made selecting a portable speaker. You will NOT be disappointed please purchase.!!!,2020,05
"One of the better Bluetooth speakers on the market, great sound, easy use and it will charge your phone. It also has great battery life.",2020,05
"Your telephone sound quality is better then this speaker,Before you do a mistake and waste your time, think to get something else",2020,05
works great but I wish it came with mounting straps,2020,05
"This unit pumps out enough base to fill my patio or job-site.  The battery lasts forever, charges quickly enough and sound quality is solid.  The sound is a bit on the warm side but easily adjusted with my phone's equalizer.  I will definitely be getting another if it ever dies.  We have dropped this thing and left it outside a few times more than I should admit but it just keeps on performing.  It is AWESOME!",2020,05
It's been almost an year since I bought this product. This is the one of best bluetooth speaker I have ever bought. Amazing sound output and battery life is fantastic.,2020,05
For someone who listens to bass heavy music this is the perfect speaker! I can feel the bass with the volume half up.,2020,05
Perfect,2020,05
If your looking for a loud speaker don’t buy this buy the wonderboom it’s cheaper in price and better sound quality.,2020,05
"We both 2 of these and truly loved them both. Great sound quality, long battery life and perfect portable size too.",2020,05
"I have flip 4's and this charge 4. Ive played both and im a little disappointed with the charge 4, My flip 4 has stereo speakers and frankly sounds just as good if not even better then my charge 4. its weird. the flip 4 sounds amazing from low volume to almost highest volume. where the charge 4 doesn't sound as nice at low volume but will keep up at higher levels, almost pushing out about the same volume as its smaller sibling flip 4. the only thing i consider the charge 4 to have over the flip 4 is it doesn't get too distorted at max volume like the flip 4. but the flip 4 just sounds great almost at any level but at max, maybe a little less bass on the flip 4 too, but not by much. im beginning to regret my charge 4 purchase. i wish i just went with a new flip 5 and see how that works out.BTW i used the charge 4 for a hotel room Bluetooth soundbar. since i live in hotels while working each month. so good sound means a lot to me, especially when i get noise complaints from the host.",2020,05
"I’ve owned several speakers from several different brands but this is the best one yet. The sound quality is phenomenal for its size. The battery life is great, too. I took it out of the box on between 50-75% battery and played it for over 12 hours before it finally died. I’ll be buying another to utilize stereo mode with the JBL app, another great feature.",2020,05
I had already buy one for myself and this one was a gift to my best friend! He really enjoy it and still thinks that was one of the best presents ever!,2020,05
"Love the way the music or a movie sounds through this speaker. The best I ever bought, very happy!",2020,05
Great,2020,05
It is not sound the way I expectedAnd it’s came whitout the charger,2020,05
I bought this 2 month ago and taken care of it and now it can't turn off. You try to turn it off it turns on right way. What a waste of money. Don't recommend buying JBL products.,2020,05
"Has Good sound but tuned more on bass side(boom boom), it makes hard to listen to minute details in musicIt would be great if JBL provides equalizer feature in App, so user can customize bass & treble according to their own preference.",2020,05
"We purchased this product because we heard good things about it.  However, the battery stopped taking a charge after about 8 months.  We filed a warranty claim and after many emails and several hours of our time sorting things out we were told there was nothing they could do because the item was manufactured the prior year, and they do not go by the date of purchase- ridiculous.  The offered a 10% coupon to buy something else from them, but obviously we will not be buying their products in the future.  Very disappointed.",2020,05
Great  product,2020,05
I Love it ......Drounds out my Neighbors Yelling at me,2020,05
"Crystal clear separation between instruments. A little tinny and heavy on the bass. For the money, I love it. Highly recommend.",2020,05
This speaker was a great addition to my back deck. It provides just enough volume and bass to make music enjoyable without being too overpowering. The charge port is great for friends who need to charge their phone while it plays our audio. I love it!,2020,05
Sick piece,2020,05
Great little wireless speaker.  Would recommend buying it,2020,05
Great sound easy to connect and long lasting battery.,2020,05
This is one of the better speakers ive ever owned. And i love how you can charge your phone off of it,2020,05
Not as good as the charge 3.,2020,05
Sound quality is great.,2020,05
Great buy ! More than I hoped for at this price,2020,05
Im so inlove with this one.. Not too small and not too big just perfect and the sound is so loud. My kids loves the color.,2020,05
"Great speaker! Exactly as described, new/sealed from factory, super fast shipping!",2020,05
"Excellent Bluetooth Speaker. Well built and also great sound quality. Links to Harman Kardon speakers and also other Jbl speakers. Definitely recommend purchasing if you’re looking for a great sounding, long lasting battery Bluetooth speaker.",2020,05
I rarely write reviews but this little bluetooth speaker from JBL is a gem. I've got a high end setup in the family room and picky about sound. It's hard to believe the depth and bass from this little guy. It actually projects a decent soundstage too. It's on my desk and improving the quality of my days at work. Crank it up between calls. Bluetooth connect is instant and battery life very long. I take it out when grilling and hanging the yard. Very portable and gets loud without distortion. How did JBL do this?,2020,05
"I bought 2 JBL speakers which had high reviews. Did not know I needed to install an APP to get them in stereo. ""Installed"" the app (confirmed by Google Play store and cant find it on my computer. Went to JBL video on Youtube for help and they want me to watch TWO video ads first?! No thank you. This is WAY too complicated.Update- I dont know how this product averages 5 stars. I have two units that I no longer use as I went back to wired speakers. aaaaaaaaaaaahhhh. Hear that? That is the sound of me no longer being frustrated by wireless speakers.The bluetooth lag is simply unacceptable. Once you figure how to pair the speakers in stereo then you have to press a button on each speaker every time you want stereo. There is only one active speaker in each unit. The battery on one of the units never fully charges. Takes a very long time to charge them.If you lived close to me then I would give them to you for free. I no longer want them.",2020,05
One of the best speakers in the market right now.,2020,05
It sounds a lot more boosted than most of the jbl’s .. fast shipment and definitely worth the money. It came well packaged and no damage from the looks and sound of it. Will update after a couple months to give its life durability and charging device,2020,05
"Update: downgrading from 2 stars to 1.  Jbl has terrible customer service at best.  If you have questions, no one will help.This comes with usb cord only.  Nothing to charge to wall outlet.  If you want to hear a text message sound notification through your speaker, forget it. The original jbl charge does allow message sound notifications.  You have to have your phone next to you constantly which totally defeats the purpose. It’s a step back. Will be returning this. Very disappointed.",2020,05
i did so much research and ended up with this model and i could not be happier. the sound quality is amazing and it could get so loud. it could fill up the whole downstairs if i wanted. i got the white color and it looks so good.,2020,05
Agree with what other reviewers said about the flat mono tone of iteration 4.  Stick with the 3 version. I returned and went straight to the B*SE website and bucked up for the revolving sound. You get what you pay for!,2020,05
"The sound quality on this is wonderful. It is directional so it won't do 360° sound but music sounds beautiful with rich and full bass. The battery life is fantastic, perfect for an all night party or all day event. It comes with the capability to charge any USB devices you may have. It is a little on the heavier side but still is portable enough to put in your backpack or  basket on your bike. Very satisfied!",2020,05
no charger included!!!! wow that's something.... sound is ok . not sure if I should keep it or return it. I'll give couple of days will try charge 3 for decision,2020,05
"I was debating between this speaker and the ultimate ears megaboom 3. My friend actually bought the UE megaboom 3 at the same time I bought the JBL charge 4. I can say this speaker has more bass and is louder in volume. I prefer the directional speakers on this (there is a front [where sound is clearer and louder] and a back).Don't love how there isn't a strap or loop or something to grip, but I did buy a REALLY cool silicone case (for $15) that has a strap and doesn't alter the sound.",2020,05
PortableDecent WeightStrong BassGreat upgrade from Flip 4Pairs well with Flip 4 to Balance a strong sound,2020,04
"Fantastic sound and perfectly sized to be conveniant and the play time goes on longer than what is advertized, Ive got the JBL charge 3 as well and in party mode they are incredible!! JBL you guys are ""killen it!"" with the bluetooth portable speakers, what can I say except JBL ROCKS!!! Thanks to you and Amazon!! Above and beyond all expectations!!!",2020,05
my JBL 4 sounds awesome.  So far it has the best sound then any other blue tooth speaker I have ever had.  I absolutely love it!,2020,05
I would give it 10 stars ⭐ if I could. My husband loves it. Very loud and great for outside at the lake. We lost it in the lake for 2 weeks and found it at the neighbors by their dock. Best part is it still works no sound quality loss or anything.  Would highly recommend.,2020,05
"Product was great. The only thing JBL could of did was add the power brick and not just the usb c cable. Also ppl to turn on the lower bass setting, Hold - and bluetooth button for 10 secs until the circle around the buttons light up WY...",2020,05
The bass definitely leaves something to be desired. Definitely proves why I've been a fan of Bose for so long. I bought this speaker for a change of pace. It's a no-go for me personally.,2020,05
 First of all the price of this speaker is cheap for the quality sound that your getting! This speaker sounds amazing! The build quality is great and the fact that is waterproof and you can charge your phone from it is an added bonus! So happy I got it! The only downside to me and this is just me being picky and annoying is that I can’t see the battery percentage on my iPhone but it does show it on the bottom of the speakers with little LED dots. GET THIS SPEAKER YOU WONT REGRET IT!!,2020,05
Bought this speaker for my dad who is an expert in car audio and he was impressed in the quality and volume this speaker has.,2020,05
I like this speaker. Crisp clear sound with nice bass. The only misleading part for me was the 20 hr playtime. After 6 hours on moderate volume it was down to the 2nd to last light and it also says you can have something charging as well thru the USB.  I highly doubt I would have a lot of battery in doing so. Nothing different in battery longevity compared to my other non JBL speakers except a better sound.,2020,05
"Best portable speaker I’ve ever bought or heard! I take this thing everywhere, perfect for camping, fishing, in the backpack hiking, in the bathroom showering. I’d recommend and purchase again.",2020,05
This is a portable powerhouse of a speaker. Excellent sound quality.  This was a birthday gift.  I already own one and recommend it highly!  5 stars,2020,05
Great product,2020,05
"Bass is weak.  Volume is low.  No way to adjust.  This was $100 more than the OontZ Angle BT speaker that I got three years ago and it's NOT better... at all.Holding down the BT button with the + button simply causes the speaker to unpair and power down.  These are not helpful.  Don't waste your money on this if you're looking for anything other that very poor bass.AND it overheats like a snowflake in the sun.  So if you want to take it to the beach, don't.  Just don't buy this.",2020,04
"(i bought this on sale at target because i needed it at that moment) great sound quality, just disappointed it’s MONO and not stereo.",2020,04
"This is over a year old, however used intermittently and recently continuously disconnects from multiple sources making it worthless to have to keep re setting every 5 minutes and sometimes seconds.  Our last JBL was amazing and had amazing sound for only 2 years when power source broke. We replaced power source and still working, but should NOT have quit after 2 years of occassional use!  Great product  TOO SHORT OF LIFE SPAN FOR $100 products!",2020,04
Great sound quality and perfect size. The green is a matte finish and blends in well with my boat.,2020,04
thankyou,2020,04
"Nothing to say, its so perfect.",2020,04
Battery life is not 20 hours. Dies after playing at the pool for 6 hours. Everyone once in a while the sound cuts in and out like my phone is too far away except it will be within range. I’d recommend getting something similar at a lower price point because I am not 100% satisfied. Also what’s with these companies assuming that we have extra charging blocks to plug in cords??,2020,04
"I am looking for a more than decent little camping speaker. I haven't run the battery down completely, only listening to it for about 3 hours. First thing I noticed listening to a few different types of music, is that it's got little to no low end.  You start to lose everything at around 50hz. I'm not looking to blow the doors off of anything, but I want a little more than this can give.The build quality feels super sturdy, and it gets pretty loud for its size. It can definitely fill my studio apartment.",2020,04
Really good sound quality for its price point. Has very decent bass and great treble.,2020,04
This one sound so good had to buy a second one.. I'm always outside grilling/ relaxing and this is perfect for my little carport  set-up. Carrie's good bass but still doesn't fall flat when you want to play some rock like Queen or Led Zeppelin. It's so well rounded second one is for surround sound..,2020,04
"jbl charge 4 pros/conspros....nothing...cons--  price is crazy hi...because there harmon/kardon backed????--volume is TRUMPED by bugani m83 for exactly half the price---battery life---is AWFUL---fully charged this up...went to work on a 10 hour shift...battery died TWICE....charged first time at lunch for 30 minutes died again.....2 hours later expected but initial OVERNIGHT 5 BAR CHARGE DID NOT LAST 5 HOURS????

"great sound,,",2020,02
"I’m really upset about this ! I had gotten this as a gift and it stopped working on the 3rd month I had it . It won’t charge anymore , I purchased a few charger cords and still won’t charge . Now ima just have to purchase a new one from somewhere else because I’m not gona take it in somewhere to get fixed and pay the same amount to fix it like I paid to buy this speaker ...",2020,04
After owning for less than 2 months the battery will not charge. What a crock of💩,2020,04
Great all around speaker. I was impressed with the volume on this! Great bass and highs!,2020,04
I love it !!!,2020,04
"Great sounding speaker. We use it at the beach so we needed a speaker that was loud enough to hear over the wind and the crashing waves. Plus, we can listen to it all day without having to recharge it.Love it.",2020,04
"AWESOME speaker that I plan on purchasing again for myself (the one I bought was for my girlfriend) but 20 hours battery life is a straight up lie. Did I mention the speaker sounds great, with a great Bluetooth range and controls. I love this thing so much. Also, my girlfriend probably doesn't know the best practices of maintaining a the longest battery life possible.",2020,04
"Meh. It’s a speaker. It’s a mono speaker and not an overly good one. 2/10 for bass, 4/10 for loudness. I think for $140 I should be getting something a bit awesome. I had an Anker $40 speaker that is similar in regards to output",2020,04
I love my speaker it my best friend.,2020,04
"The size is perfect for me. It is portable, so I can listen wherever I am.",2020,04
I love it! Sounds great portable and easy set up!,2020,04
"Great speaker.  We use it on the lanai for “pool music”.  A bit much on the bass out of the box, but adjustable via the app.  Can be paired with additional speakers for a large area.",2020,04
long lasting battery one speaker isn’t bad instead of two like charge 3 pink best choice just a little heavy,2020,04
"This speaker broke less than a month after purchase. Normal, medium-volume usage only. Not pleased",2020,04
"Very good service, good quality.",2020,04
love this and use it all the time!,2020,04
My JBL SPEAKER. I didn’t receive the charging cord or the carrying case that was suppose to come with it. Could and would you please send those two these to me.Thank you!,2020,04
This speaker has amazing sound and I love the fact that if you have multiple JBL speakers you can sync them all. A little heavier than I would have liked for a beach bag but no too heavy at all. I’ve already taken this speaker on three trips with me and it’s been a hit.,2020,04
Is great!!,2020,04
Not as loud as I expected but quality of sound is excellent.,2020,04
Received speaker in April.  I am having problems with the battery not lasting.  I put battery charging and it doesn't go any further than 3 bars. (gets stuck on 4th bar blinking)  Not sure what is the next step.,2020,04
This speaker is perfect for taking anywhere. Sounds great & you can connect multiple devises via Bluetooth at the same time.,2020,04
"We bought one of these for our week at the beach and man, what sound! Connecting it to my phone was a breeze and the controls were simple to use. Battery life is insane too. Definitely recommend.",2020,04
"This speaker has been a nice upgrade from the standard 30-40 dollar speaker you can get anywhere. The sound is rich, and it does have good bass. I can why others stated some of the voice gets drowned out at times but enough to deter me from not buying this speaker. Overall the sound is great and can get decently loud. The color I got was SAND and it looks great. One thing that does not make sense to me is they dont give a power cord. I dont recall the last time I've spent this much on an electronic that didnt come with a accessory that is as important as that. All in all, I like it and very pleased with my purchase.",2020,04
Quality is Great!,2020,04
Was ready to use right out of the box.  Great sound quality.,2020,04
"Great sound!  Solid design, easily portable. Should be able to enjoy it for years.",2020,04
Perfect,2020,04
Love it. Its way better then the beats pill.,2020,04
WORTH IT 🤩🤩,2020,03
Good for pool listening,2020,03
Awesome speaker. Loud as you want it to go. We use it outside and it’s an amazing little guy. Get it wet keeps on going,2020,03
"I have had it for almost a month and it sounds great. I was nervous because other reviews stated that what they received was not real. Well, this one was and it sounds great. Plenty of sound to do the job. Charges quick and is very portable.",2020,03
I love the color looks kinda gold tbh,2020,03
Charging is a little bit of a pain. It changes really slow. Love it though. And for some reason I have to keep connecting to it and I thought it would just remember my device.,2020,03
"Portable. Loud! Cool to look at (ordered the black camo) Battery life is really good, we spend HOURS in our backyard chilling by the pool and its never disappointed.  Very happy with my decision to buy the JBL Charge.",2020,02
Speaker sounds great battery last forever,2019,12
"I have a small Bluetooth speaker and I was looking for one a bit bigger for an upcoming trip. I wanted something that could fill a living room and kitchen with some decent sound. I first bought the Soundcore Flare+ and while I liked the 360 sound and EQ settings on the app, it just didn’t fill the room with full sound. The JBL might be a bit narrower on the soundstage, the overall quality and low end were enough to seal the deal. I also like you can connect two devices at once. The Charge 4 has a nice heft to it and the construction is solid. Definitely feel like I got my money’s worth.PROS: Solid bass, Even sound, quality construction, connect two devices at once, battery life seems good, USB-C port for charging the speakerCONS: Soundstage a bit narrow, app has no EQ settings",2020,03
"The product was a toy, Junk. False advertisment",2020,03
"Great sound quality, amazing battery, and lightweight!",2020,03
"While the overall sound is decent for the price, I bought two speakers specifically for the ""Party"" feature, which is supposed to allow two or more of the same speakers to connect and play together. I've had nothing but problems with that feature. I've tried resetting per company instructions. I even sent them back and got two new speakers but the same problems exist. If you want one speaker, go right ahead, but I would advise against getting more than one.",2020,03
"Whereas on the Charge 3 the bass gets a bit overwhelming, on the Charge 4 the bass feels non-existant by comparison. Further, sound on the Charge 4 is less clear than on the Charge 3, details in your music get off, faint notes disappear. Although the bass on the Charge 3 could be overwhelming, the overall sound quality was much better.Further, the Charge 4 is heavier, bulkier than the Charge 3 despite less functionality. On the Charge 3 I could make phone calls, but there is no calling ability on the Charge 4.If the Charge 3 upgraded its bluetooth to be better compatible with more modern devices, I would trash the Charge 4 and go back to the Charge 3.The only improvement on the Charge 4 over the Charge 3 is that the power button is a bit easier to press.",2020,03
Fantastic sound! Got this to bring to the beach and around the yard.,2020,03
"Hands down, best speaker out there. It’s water proof & yucky dirt resistant. Can take it anywhere in the world! It’s the best.",2020,03
Love the sound system...Great buy,2020,03
"Great sound in a small and portable unit. EZ to operate. I use it more than either of my Bose Wave units, or my Techniques and Harman/Kardon receiver.",2020,03
"this is my fourth JBL speaker. My very first one was the little to go that lasted forever. I've had it for 5 years now and my daughter still uses it. My second one was a charge three it lasted a year and a half before the battery stopped working, my second charge three year and a half as well battery stopped working now I just ordered a charge four I've had it for a little over a week now and it glitches. It's staticky and it's horrible. I don't I will ever buy another JBL. I am very disappointed with the charge 4!Edit: I've had it a couple weeks and the battery only stays charged for 1 day. Do not waste your money!!",2020,03
The song volume is acceptable but is not like the ads or the pay rewinding people show.Pd: Thx of god i buy in discount price,2020,03
"This is loud.  Louder than VTIN b2 OR R7, louder than Aomais Life.Bass is good.  Miss and highs kind of muffled.  Some distortion when over 80% volume.  But very good speaker.Overpriced some, but good speaker.",2020,03
Best speakersout there,2020,03
Like it so much.  I bought a second one.,2020,03
Loud and long lasting I use it at work and it it’s plenty loud enough,2020,03
"Great brand. Speaker has a lot of bass.Perfect for home or on the go!  In my opinion,  this speak tops ""The beats pill""!!",2020,03
these compact portable speakers kick your ear buds. Love them.  Great sounds,2020,03
"Can't respond to battery life haven't had it but 1 day , but sounds great seems like a great speaker...been listening to all evening if it has a good battery life would definitely buy again..update...05/25/20...I made sure battery was fully charged today..lasted 6hrs playing at about half volume..still had over 1/2 of battery life left...I'm thinking I'm gonna love this speaker...if it has any durability",2020,03
"I have now purchased two JBL bluetooth speakers. I wrote to JBL about the first one not holding a charge for even half of the advertised time. I never heard back. My second purchase does not hold a charge for half the time advertised either :-(My JBL Flip 4 purchased from Amazon in July 2018 have only ever held a 3–4 hour charge. It's supposed to hold a charge for 12 hours.I reluctantly purchased another one, but figured my Flip was a dud—I have friends that say their Charges hold charges for a long time: JBL Charge 4 from Amazon in April 2020. My Charge 4 only hold a charge for about 7 hours. It's supposed to hold a charge up to 20 hours.The fact that these speakers do not hold charger for as long as they are supposed defeats the purpose. I can't use them on trips or in the woods like I should be able to as they need to be charged frequently.I bring my charge outside when I garden and it dies before my day is over and I have to connect it to a power source.I was wondering why my Charge 4 didn't sound as good or was as loud as some I had heard before and now I realize it's because it's not built the same as the Charge 3.",2020,03
"Great sound and size, my Grandson trying to steal mine so I just ordered him one for his birthday:)",2020,03
The sound of these speakers are mediocre to poor. The Bluetooth connection continually misfires and sound dissolves into static.I was surprised that this kind of speaker gets good marks.,2020,03
"Sounds terrible with the mono speaker , returning",2020,03
Great speaker until it completely died on me a year after purchase. Will not hold a charge or play sound now but will turn on. Wish I had bought the warranty.,2020,02
The smaller flip 4 is not only louder but sounds better due to 2 speakers instead of the mono speaker in the charge 4,2020,01
"I got this speaker to ""upgrade"" from my old UE boom 2. Well, I would say the only things it does better is battery life and a little more volume. When you turn the jbl up to higher volumes while at work you can hear the low end effecting the highs and the speaker is very directional so it very difficult to find a location for the speaker that doesn't turn it into a shrill little squeak box. The ue I have is a much smaller speaker but it has nearly 360 degrees of speakers so it sounds really great from all angles. All in all the jbl definitely wasn't worth the money. I'm sticking with UE.",2020,03
This thing is loud and sounds awesome! I had the jbl 2 version of this and one day it just got really quite. I have only used the jbl 4 once but I love the sound and volume. I will probably use it over the stereo system in my boat which is pretty nice because this thing sounds so good.,2020,03
"Smashing sparking clear undistorted sound from 50 hertz all the way to 20,000 hertz. And loud without distortion.",2020,03
"I love this it is very portable, waterproof and awesome..",2020,03
Excellent sound and portability and battery life highly recommended for a portable sound quality,2020,03
"Right out of the box this thing has some weight to it, feed very sturdy. Sound gets loud with really good low end bass.",2020,03
You get what you pay for! It's worth it. The base is great.  Sound quality flawless. 1-2-3 Bluetooth connected.  We're ordering another one to balance out the sound in our large pool area.,2020,03
Best  jbl speaker very good sound . Color are greats. Many hours of baterry charge.,2020,03
The best!,2020,03
"I was tired of buying little cheap speakers that weren't worth the money, didn't last very long and had terrible sound.  So, I decided to spend a lot more for a quality speaker.  I got this for use by the pool.  It linked very easily to my phone.  The sound is great with plenty of bass.  I can use it for several hours a few days in a row without worrying about the battery running down.  It seems to charge back up fairly fast too.  So glad I spent the money on this, totally pleased with my purchase.",2020,03
"I originally heard this thing at Christmas (someone else got one as a gift)... Listening to them test it out, it put out some amazing sound from such a small device. It does sound great... But there are technical glitches that are really irritating...The first second of sound cuts out until it ""wakes up"" from its bluetooth soft-sleep-like-state (i'm guessing it's to save battery life)... It's supposed to have an app to tailor all kinds of controls, but after installing it, it refused to recognize the speaker no matter what I did. (It paired fine, I can play music to it from my phone, but communication with the app? Nope.)A little bit of user-oriented testing would've gone a long way here.",2020,03
"v4 was ok...slightly bigger, kinda cooler looking... BUT they've had time to dial in the planned obsolescence...Battery died 1 year and 1 week after purchase. Thumbs waaaay down. I bought v1, v2, v3 and v4. Done with JBL.:-)",2020,03
This thing knocks! Great sound quality. This is the 2nd one I've purchased and I love it!,2020,03
Best purchase I made on amazon! Highly recommended!,2020,03
Fast shipping & great product,2020,03
The sound had great quality. I would recommend it,2020,03
"Great outdoor speaker to keep on the patio or take to the beach. It is a mono speaker, so better for portable or outdoor use. Great color!",2020,03
I spent A LOT of time trying to find a good portable speaker that sounded great and didn’t cost $200.  This is it.  It was worth the wait.  I’ll be getting a second one as well.,2020,03
Not satisfied with the sound quality. I was expecting for this to be a little louder,2020,03
"Great sound, compact, durable, great value for the quality",2020,03
Dam this is a loudspeaker,2020,03
Excellent,2020,03
My husband loves his pre-Fathers Day speaker! He plans to use when he is in his shop/man cave! Sounded great! He also liked how he could charge his phone while he listens to his music!,2020,03
Won't charge,2020,03
"I had used one of these in my place of work a while back, and just wanted one for home. The only complaint I have is mostly that due to the layout of my apartment, sometimes it just kinda jumps a little depending where my phone is.",2020,02
I had different models was time for new one since going out town. Ship was fast but the thing would not stay connected to any phone for music or call. Sent back and had to go purchase from store and pay little more. But no issues and sounds great. Sent back got refund for broken one. Understand that’s not seller fault they can’t test new equipment and not all will function out box correctly. So for the hassle gave 3 stars,2020,02
"Happy with this speaker.  Not too heavy and the bass is just about right for me... similar in sound to Sony's old ""Mega-Bass"" option.",2020,02
These units do not last and customer service is non existent.. unit was working fine then I charged it and nothing .. zero sound and factory reset does nothing .. wrote email no response .. called factory support and no working telephone .. kind of hard to get warranty when no one is home !!’ This is the 2nd one to do this won’t be a third !’,2020,02
"I acknowledge that this isn't the loudest speaker JBL has to offer, but with that being said, let me just say that for the size of this thing, there is -no- better speaker available, PERIOD.",2020,02
"I didn’t even have it for a day a it stoped working, it connects just fine but it doesn’t turn on and doesn’t play music at all.",2020,02
Amazing sound. I play it from the kitchen and can hear it in the bathroom. Light weight. very portable,2020,01
"I purchased this speaker over other portable options specifically because it had an AUX input. When using this input, the speaker has the brilliant design of shutting off when the signal falls below a certain threshold. This threshold is very high, and the the shut off happens basically immediately. The result is a continuous stuttering of whatever you're listening to, which is absolutely unbearable.Searching online, many people experience this. Some are able to solve it by cranking up the volume all the way up. This didn't work for me. Apparently you can remove a resistor on the circuit board to disable this built in ""feature"", but I just returned my unit instead. JBL was useless when it came to customer support. I won't be purchasing any products from them in the future, and I don't recommend you do either.",2020,02
"After having the JBL Flip 4 for several years and loving it, I decided to upgrade and purchase the JBL Charge 4. I bought it new and once it came in tested it out. However, the sound quality was extremely distorted and sounded like the speaker was already blown because the bass was so scratchy even at 25% volume. I am not sure if this is an issue with the JBL Charge 4 or the individual speaker I received. Either way I will be returning this product and am very disappointed.",2020,02
Picked up Bluetooth fast and sound quality is amazing,2020,02
Love it! Have had many portable speakers knowing full well that portability would sacrifice sound quality. Not so with my JBL Charge 4. Great sound! So easy to connect. Works great in the yard and on my boat. Got a great deal on it as well. Definitely would like to try out the Connect+ feature when I pick up another one.,2020,02
"The speaker connected to my phone right away. However, it was very difficult to connect it to Alexa and it didn't work very smoothly.... I had to go into the app to reconnect every time I wanted to use it! The main problem, however, is that it wouldn't connect at all to the JBL app! I contacted customer service and they suggested resetting the speaker and explained how to do this. I followed the directions and the speaker behaved exactly as they said it would and then turned off! Success!! Except, not so much. Now the speaker won't turn on at all!! I'm hoping this is just a defective device and when I return it and receive my new one it will work much better. If so, I will rate it again in a more positive light.Added note: I once again was able to contact JBL customer service and they got the device working again! It works perfectly, except it still won't connect to the JBL app! After reading reviews of the app, this is clearly a failure of the app, not the speaker! I love the speaker! I gave a4 instead of 5 only because of the problem with the JBL app!",2020,02
👍,2020,02
"Terrible, just received it. Charged it, I didn't leave it plugged in after charging. When i tried it the next day it gliched on and turn off. Does not turn on now. I've read some other reviews, and this is apparently happening alot with JBL products coming from Amazon.",2020,02
"Great speaker. Use it everyday when working out, haven’t plugged it in to charge for over a week, great battery life. Sounds is awesome! Worth the money",2020,02
Awesome Speaker!!!,2020,02
My niece loves it!!!,2020,02
this speaker is great. everyone in the family loves it.,2020,02
Bought this for my wife (that is not techie) for her birthday and she loves it. She is playing music from her iPhone all the time. I can't believe how good the sound is.,2020,02
Omg I've my speaker it better the cheapest speaker I have in my backpack 🎒 that cheap one whack and the jbl speaker is way beyond better I've it so much thanks Amazon 👍,2020,02

My new speaker was received a day early and works perfectly couldnt be more happier :),2020,02
Thy send me JBL with out charger I paid 150 for it I don’t Understand sending something very Expensive-with out of charger,2020,02
"Clear sound, bass is deep. Worth the price and delivery was on time!",2020,02
I don't like the way its been sound. When music is on it skip some small parts of the music. It sounds like the fake once. What I like about is the style and how its super loud.,2020,02
"Dear JBL, next model update, it would be nice to have a strap or a lanyard. I have 2 Flip 4's and an Extreme and they all have either a strap or a lanyard, which I use often, both for work and play. Otherwise, no complaints!",2020,02
Great sound!!! love it,2020,02
"Just got my JBL Charge 4 today and so far so good. I will give it a 4 stars right now, will update later....",2020,02
"Bought  one and liked it. Bought another for Stereo sound. The second came factory refurbished, No Notice or mentioning on the amazon page about refurb. I believed I was buying new. Not Cool,  At least let the consumer choose weather or not to pay full price for a refurb",2020,02
"I has purchased one of this items but unfortunately it just stop working without a reason, it still looks on and connect to my bluetooth device but it doesn't make any sound, and unfortunately it looks like there is not a way to fix or to be replace from the seller",2020,02
Love this lil speaker. Sounds great,2020,02
"Bought it 6 months ago, works perfectly.",2020,02
"Nice sound love the bass, not too loud but loud for its size",2020,02
Love everything about it,2020,02
"I was thrifty up until now not wanting to spend too much, should have bought this first. Great inside and outside. Good battery life.",2020,02
"We were very excited to get this speaker. We have the JBL boom box connect + . When we turned it on and played music there was static and the music would speed up. We updated the app and tried several things but the static, etc. stayed. It’s very disappointing.",2020,02
why there's no lights or showing if it's charged or not have to turn it on to see the lights to see if it's charge do you have to do that all the time turn it on to see if it's charged or can you just plug it in and the lights will show if it's when it's going to be fully chargeYou have to turn it on to see the lights to see if it's charge do you have to do that all the time turn it on to see if it's charged or can you just plug it in and the lights will show maybe  something wrong with mine please let me know,2020,02
Absolutely fell in love with it. The sound is very rich and fills the room with beautiful music. Will definitely be purchasing another one.,2020,02
I like the look and design of the product love it sounds great,2020,02
lousy product in less than 2 months doesn't work anymoreyou already discounted 2 months in my account the amount of 13.85 I was never a prime member if you do not return my money I will file a case I I never registered as prime,2020,02
Husband got this to replace an OLD portable Bose speaker. He loves this new speaker! Easy to tote around outside for spending time grilling or throwing some corn hole. Great sound quality and range!,2020,02
"I set it up to my phone and when I let it play the sound was really bad , it wasn’t playing the song clearly. That’s why I would like to return it",2020,02
I like music batter,2020,02
"Tried to return it today . Will not hold a charge , requires different charging cord than iPhone . Cost to much for how bad product is plus I ordered protective carrying case separate . Would not ever purchase again . Just ordered new Bose waterproof speaker .",2020,02
It was just OK,2020,02
Fantastic!!! Sounds great and perfect size!,2020,02
Over priced,2020,02
"Bought one for my girlfriends birthday and bought one for myself. We are able to pair to each others portable sound system, the battery life was my concern for her and so fare its been phenomenal. And the  music is like you are at a live concert..!",2020,02
"If i could put ZERO stars i would!!! My order came with the correct packaging but as soon as i opened it, it was NOT the speaker that is advertised. Someone replaced the speaker with a used, black speaker that isn’t even the same brand! Completely ridiculous!!!",2020,02
Awesome Bluetooth JBL speaker listening to music while being in quarantined thank you JBL,2020,02
Awesome speaker,2020,02
"I've had this speaker for less than a year and have, for the most part, absolutely loved it! I use it in my car for long road trips and when the speakers in my laptop blew out, I started using it every day for podcasts, etc from my laptop. Unfortunately, the battery is just not holding a charge. It flashes red (indicating low battery) and then reads fully charged when I plug it in -- after less than a minute. Totally inaccurate, as it reverts to flashing red again in about 10 minutes.Very frustrating. And ridiculously hard to change the battery myself (I don't own the right tools), so I'm now in the market for a new speaker.",2020,02
"Positives: Excellent speaker for portability and battery life.  Great for worry free music at the beach or around a pool and they are loud.  Great looking speakers that are small and very portable. Negatives: sound lacks quality.  If you just want loud good sound this speaker will make u happy.  If you’re looking for quality, you will need to step it up to a bigger JBL or a different product.",2020,02
"Finally decided to buy a portable speaker and I'm not disappointed with my decision. First time playing impressed me.Update: after using the speaker for some time, it's not the best. Would I recommend? Depends on the purpose. The BT range is pretty incredible. It gets the job done for being portable. Like others stated, it's mono with the two woofers. Battery seems to drain on me a little quicker so I make sure I keep it charged after or during use.",2020,02
Great speaker I’m just butt hurt that they advertise a yellow speaker when in reality it’s like ugly faded goldish. Just a head up for people who want yellow.,2020,02
"I even bought a replacement plan and I still haven't gotten a new one. One day it was fine, then the next it just stopped working.",2020,02
"Maybe this is just personal preference but the single offset speaker is very distracting. If you hold it in front of you, you can immediately notice that there’s no sound coming from the left side. I initially thought maybe mine was defective as why would such an expensive device be mono. I did more research and learned it was designed that way. The sound quality is still excellent, I just personally can’t look past the unequal sound distribution.",2020,02
Excellent!!,2020,02
"I got this for the bass, which delivers as promised.  It may be a mono speaker but It doesn’t sound like one - and you can always get a second and pair it.  Clear sound, plenty loud, amazing bass for its size.  Very happy w this product.",2020,02
"I bought a second speaker to have it in Stereo but I notice while having it that the other speaker cut off a few seconds. Other then that it feels like a brand new speaker. If I want true stereo I need to by a splitter and connect both as normal speakers for my laptop. Plus the syncing with Youtube is pretty bad with videos. It sounds clear and loud. Oh and one last thing about in stereo mode on and iphone it works with one app at a time so use it on Youtube for one day with the JBL Connect and then use it with Google Music another day when you sync the stereo mode with the audio app you that you want to use it. On Windows 10 its basically party mode and no real stereo mode. I did this with my laptop and one speaker sync in and the other sync in a a bit slower of 2 seconds to sync in. This is why I give it 4 stars but over rall I can charge my phone or use each one as a speaker louder then my phone, I cant use it as a Google or Alexa voice activator or even siri but as two speakers in stereo is good on IOS on my iphone 8 but cant do it 100% on Windows.",2020,02
I had the jbl charge 2 and the Xtreme. The sound quality is equal to the charge 2 and didn’t sound any better at all. The style changed but other then that it did not impress. Besides being smaller it’s not better then the extreme in any way. I ended up returning it.,2020,02
Is better,2020,02
"Great sound quality, love being able to pair with more Charge 4s for surround or amplified sound.",2020,02
The item stopped working only 2 months after receiving. Won’t hold charge and turns off immediately.,2020,02
Right channel only.  Evident playing dark side of the moon. I'm very disappointed and it's getting returned tomorrow.,2020,02
"I had a JBL portable speaker like this and it developed problems after 18 months, well past the warranty. The company offered me a 20% off coupon on the purchase of my next one but unfortunately it still came out more cost effective to buy a new one from Amazon! So I bought from Amazon. Great sound, easy to charge! Can’t knock it! Just wish company would have replaced it for less than the projected cost for me!",2020,02
It stopped charging when plugged in. It's out of battery and I can no longer use it.,2020,02
I just purchased (4) JBL Charger 4 Speakers.Àmazon chargers me $179.95 Each.They are priced on Àmazon at $139.95 Each.Please reconfigure my Bill.Shelley,2020,02
needs to be louder - 30rms lol also only last around 8 to 9 hours - 75% to full volume - and if u use bass mode - Speaker cant handle it - at full volume,2020,02
My mother loved it,2020,02
This speaker is easy to use. It also has EXCELLENT sound quality!,2020,02
Speaker sounds realy good clear with good bass.,2020,02
Basically it’s not charging I have connected  three or four different chargers but there is no any reactionIts working since 2019 December until nowThe sound was good not greatAnd am very very sad about chargingDont recomend,2020,02
Its great,2020,02
Just love it 😆 I 🎸 all the time,2020,02
Good sound quality and battery life,2020,02
"I love it, the sound quality was great. I love the battery life. I rarely need the water proof part but I bring into the shower almost everyday. If you are looking for a good speaker this one is a good one.",2020,02
My man love his speaker,2020,02
Love it,2020,02
I am so happy with my pick. The battery life is great. The sound quality is unbelievable. Sounds like a big boom box.,2020,02
Awesome. And only $100! Unreal.,2020,02
Extremely great speaker with great portability. Sound quality doesnt miss a beat and has great volume. Awesome bonus to sync up other jbls for surround,2020,02
Loudness good,2020,02
"My wife and I spend a lot of time in the outdoors and were looking to upgrade out speaker. The most important things that we were looking for were: 1) sound quality 2) needed to be waterproof and 3) something that would be durable and last a long time. This speaker has certainly delivered on all of these things! One of the biggest complaints that I saw while during research was the mono speaker. There are some users out there that severely dislike this design and, honestly, it almost swayed me away from buying it. That said, I could not be happier with this speaker! Mono speaker works great, produces amazing sound (really loud) , and it truly is water proof - trust me, we've tested!I would definitely buy this speaker again!",2020,02
Awesome,2020,02
Great,2020,02
Great item to carry with you,2020,02
Great speaker. Great sound.,2020,02
Bought 4 of these bad boys to spread around the house. They work great!,2020,02
Best portable speaker I’ve ever purchased. This thing BOOMS!,2020,02
Great product for the price !,2020,02
"This thing is nuts!!! The sound, looks, material, everything was so worth it!!!",2020,02
I love it,2020,02
Love this speaker! It’s lightweight enough to carry around the house and to travel with. Can’t wait to use it at the beach and pool this summer.,2020,02
Great sound,2020,02
Super loud! Plug in cover flap to make it water proof. Love it!,2020,02
"Big loud, very good. I dance to clear and audible music.",2020,02
I got it for my wife and she loved it,2020,02
I had a flip 4; this is flip4 on STEROIDS. Great base for a relatively small speaker,2020,02
All in all a great product. Seller was amazing. Fast shipping. Speaker has been great.,2020,02
Wish it was a little louder...... expecteda Lot more from James B Lancing,2020,02
"I really enjoy this product.  Such a big sound out of a small device.  Hooks up very easy and battery lasts a long it, you can even charge your phone with it.  I love mine",2020,02
I assumed this speaker had bump and more than 1 speaker inside. Well I was wrong big time it’s 1 speaker on the right and it only gets loud with volume cranked all the way up. I had a aomias speaker that bumped louder and was for only $50. This speaker is overpriced for what it offers. Only goo thing Is the charge port is a usb-c which doesn’t break as easy as the standard android port.,2020,02
love it,2020,02
My first JBL speaker and plan on buying more after purchasing this one. The battery on this thing is amazing! Excellent sound as expected from the JBL brand and great sound for the size. Phone always connects easy and charges it fast as well. Just want to buy more because I hear JBL speakers connect fast and easy with one another.,2020,02
Love it,2020,02
It's great,2020,02
I almost didn’t submit this review because they’re forcing me to type something.,2020,02
Bought it for my daughter for Christmas and she LOVES it!!!  The sound is amazing and perfect size to take with her to college.,2020,02
It stopped turning on after 6 months. The battery is fine and the buttons clearly work. It just has odd power light combinations and suddenly won't turn on.,2020,02
"Good overall product, 10/10 in sound quality/connectivity/battery life.",2020,02
Thumbs up,2020,02
Everything you would expect from a JBL speaker!,2020,02
Good,2020,02
Awesome product,2020,02
We use it when we are out riding,2020,02
"Got this for my husband for Christmas and he uses it all the time. He loves it and it works great!! Worth the money!******update******It WAS worth the money until it just stopped working. So my husband only uses it to listen to music while he’s taking showers and it sits on the windowsill that’s three feet away from the shower so it doesn’t get wet and he regularly charges it. One day two weeks ago he tried to connect to it before a shower and it’s saying it’s connected but not playing anything. He’s let it charge, turned it in and off and it’s still not doing anything.I really thought this would be worth the money especially with how much he loved it but apparently they just stop working after two months.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PURCHASE! Sad to have spent so much on it!",2020,02
Great speaker. Worth the money.,2020,02
Listening 2 music & videos,2020,02
Pretty good,2020,02
Perfect for listening to tunes while doing dishes or hanging out in the backyard.,2020,02
Sound quality really good . And the color I got (red) is super vibrant . I love it,2020,02
"Love Everything about this bluetooth speaker! Easy to connect any device to it, also pairing other jbl speakers, is awesome too.",2020,02
"when using at higher volumes, the sound has some distortion",2020,01
"Great sound and holds a charge for a long time, I like that we can connect to other jbl speakers",2020,01
For the price product is good. Does what it says it will do. Easy to use. Recommended good quality and stylish,2020,01
Love the sound.,2020,01
Just what I was looking for to use at work. Great sound for such a small speaker.,2020,01
Worth it!,2020,01
All good,2020,01
The bluetooth could of allowed voice calls to be made through the speaker,2020,01
I LOVE THIS SPEAKER!!! I took it to California and it is so easy and light to travel with! The sound quality is amazing!!! Not only that but the battery life is soo good! I didn’t charge it the whole trip and I used it for a few hours each day. I have never had any problems with it so far but I would highly recommend!!,2020,01
"Sound could be a little bit better, but over I'm happy with it",2020,01
Perfect and great product !,2020,01
The battery life is not 20 hours not by a long shot,2020,01
Nice upgrade from my 1st gen charge (which still works perfectly as well),2020,01
"Wonderful sound, battery life is amazing I've only charged it 4 times since I bought it and it's been three months of me having it. Only down side at full volume the bass starts to get messy that aside I'd buy this again if I had the chance to.",2020,01
"LOVE this speaker. I have a ton of them and this one stays charged SO much longer than any speaker I’ve had. For the size and price, it’s unbeatable.",2020,01
great speaker,2020,01
I love it!!,2020,01
"Absolutely love these speakers!  5-Stars, hands down!",2020,01
Good speaker,2020,01
"Full sound, crisp definition of whatever you have playing.",2020,01
Great sound,2020,01
Really pleased with the quality and sound. Also easy to setup,2020,01
Awesome,2020,01
"Very sturdy, decent enough sound and easy to connect. My teenager loves it.",2020,01
Impressive sound and quality. Slightly bulky to cart around but otherwise works wonderfully! Can pair with other (compatible) JBL speakers for even louder experience!,2020,01
"Overall, the speaker is great. It is quite a bit hefty but that is to be expected with all the rubber keeping it waterproof as well as the rest of the hardware inside. The battery life is pretty spot on, with about 20 hour of constant usage. And the sound is clear and loud! Very much worth the purchase and if you catch it on sale, even more so. 😁",2020,01
Very nice Bluetooth speaker with powerful bass and clean sound.,2020,01
"We tried the Charge 3, too small for our needs, Extreme was too much base.  The Charge 4 is just right!  Has lots of sound for an outdoor venue we are wanting to have music at yet can be turned down to still hear the clarity of the instruments.  The battery stays charged for days of playing, definately 20 hours or more.  We bought two to sync together for our outdoor gathering area.  We have been quite happy with this model.",2020,01
Good speaker. Full portability.,2020,01
"Sounds great, good value",2020,01
"Sound quality is surprisingly good, just make sure you have the front facing you. The battery lasts a long time, and the quality doesn turn to gsrbage when you turn the volume up. This product is expensive, but you get what you pay for.",2020,01
"This thing is a durable beast. Much better bass than the JBL Flip, but it is also much larger. Not too large to not bring places, but large enough that it isn’t quite as back pack portable as the Flip.  If you are looking for a mildly portable, car camping speaker... then look no further. This Charge 4 is the bomb.",2020,01
I absolutely love this speaker!!! It’s everything I need and wanted in a speaker!!!,2020,01
I use this everyday in my postal truck..carry it in the rain..charge it once a week with one or two out of five battery life lights left..sound quality is excellent and pairs to my phone easily..I use it 4 to 6 hours a day..definitely one of the best portable speakers I’ve owned,2020,01
Great speaker sounds amazing. I gave it a 4 star only because it needs a little more bass and it doesn’t make calls. It would be nice if I can call and talk through speaker then I would have gave it 5 stars.,2020,01
"I was looking for deep base with portable size for Travel if needed,I used it indoor amazing sound didn't try yet outdoor but its the expected JBL quality",2020,01
Works great and the sound is awesome!,2020,01
Nice sound! Bought it for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.,2020,01
Love it. Best choice I made its clean and has bass as well.,2020,01
Nice speaker. Big sound and good battery life.,2020,01
Good,2020,01
"Absolutely amazing, I take it with me everywhere.",2020,01
Best speaker dollar for dollar on the market.,2020,01
"I heard this little speaker before when a friend brought it over . Had to get one, and it works just as enjoyable as the previous model. Which is what was brought over",2020,01
Great will buy a second one,2020,01
Love it especially when I’m cleaning around the house ! Only wish I can do voice control like the other job speakers.,2020,01
Overall great!,2020,01
Absolutely love this speaker!  Love that it has a long battery life and the sound is amazing!,2020,01
Perfect little speaker. Jam around the house with it or take it with you wherever. Battery will last me days and this thing even has bass. Perfect for my fishing trips or camping trips.,2020,01
Great product!,2020,01
Excellent quality you expect from JBL.,2020,01
"I would have liked to control bass and treble, but again, sound quality is great.",2020,01
"Excellent sound for all music. However, when the speaker is turned on or off there is a loud musical note played that is very disturbing.",2020,01
Easy to travel with,2020,01
Great speaker,2020,01
"This unit is a bit on the heavy side,  my husband needed to replace the Puma speaker,  this is much more bulky,  but sound quality is excellent!",2020,01
Loud portable speaker that is very easy to link up to another JBL speaker for music playing in 2 areas.,2020,01
Wanted a speaker that was capable of playing music at a louder volume in a warehouse and home etc. This does the job.,2020,01
Very happy with the sound quality.,2020,01
Was bigger than my last speaker and louder to if you like to feel like you’re at a concert than buy this one.,2020,01
This is the best speaker I have ever had!!,2020,01
Nice sound,2020,01
The sound from this is great! It’s been to many parties and outside and the beach! Would highly recommend it! Bluetooth works great! My older parents can even use it with ease. Getting them one for their anniversary!!,2020,01
"Not my first JBL, great products!!",2020,01
Great product for price,2020,01
Got it for my nephew. He had smaller one but wanted to upgrade. Got really good deal during Black Friday sale. Nice system for home and now he’s using smaller one for his car.,2020,01
"The voice not as high as I excepted , but it did the jop , i liked the design , i didnt like the yellow shade though ..",2020,01
Thing sounds great until it shorts. Literally had the thing a month and it shorted out and will not work. Contacted JBL/Harmon and was essentially scoffed at. Since then I've replaced BOTH the battery and motherboard to no avail. I cannot remember the last time I wasted nearly $200 like this.,2020,01
"Totally shocked at how clear sounding it is, it definitely gets loud.  I was very impressed with the life of battery.  However I now know why it last.  If you are not playing anything after awhile it automatically shuts itself off.  Kind of a nice feature.  We like it because of the Bluetooth and use it while driving in our RV. We have an older motorhome and it doesn’t have a fancy radio with GPS or Bluetooth so this portable speaker works great.  However using GPS Google Maps from phone is nice but while traveling it may only speak an hour later, well the speaker will shut itself off if nothing comes through in an hour.  So to fix that we just listen to SIRIUS via Bluetooth by phone and when Google GPS needs to give directions it just cuts through music to announce what ever.  So it works out great.",2020,01
Get the next size up.....sound volume is weak,2020,01
Great!,2020,01
"Awesome quality sound. Love JBL products you will not be disappointed if you use this for going to the beach, hanging in the yard or using for work sites. Also very durable",2020,01
"Amazing sound quality, the bass is awesome.",2020,01
Great product!,2020,01
This is high quality and nice looking,2020,01
Absolutely love the sound,2020,01
Amazing sound and battery life! Can't wait to take it to the beach this summer!,2020,01
Sound quality excellent.  Easy to connect. Check the box carefully or you will miss the compartment that holdsthe charger like I did.  I have only had to charge it once after more than 6 months. No hunt for the right adapters,2020,01
My son loves it! Thank you!,2020,01
Excellent,2020,01
Works amazing. Exactly what I wanted,2020,01
Amazing!,2020,01
"Sturdy construction. Reasonable volume, too much bass level.",2020,01
It was a gift for my 16 year old daughter she LOVES it! Takes it to the beach and I have to keep telling her to turn it down. Lol.,2020,01
Fantastic,2020,01
Love it,2020,01
"Great speaker, nice sound",2020,01
"Love the color love the size I have a JBL Extreme and bought this for my babe for Christmas. The sound is solid. I was so surprised. Great buy great price, and great quality.",2020,01
Love everything about this speaker,2020,01
Great product,2020,01
"I have always really liked JBL products so I wasn’t hesitant when spending the money on this one. As always, puts out great quality music and has a long battery life. Pleased as ever with my purchase!",2020,01
Great quality sound and long lasting battery.,2020,01
sounds great,2020,01
"Awesome sound, great for use in our RV or around the lake.  Battery has some kick which accounts for the weight but that works for me.",2020,01
And she loved it,2020,01
So far so good. Great sound and I have no trouble pairing two of them together.,2020,01
It was a gift for my daughter and she is delighted,2020,01
I bought it at 99U$D for that price it is définitively à good price.Well y other speaker is thé revovle plus from Bose. So hard to compare . Not the same range of price neither power.. But this is a Nice handy sound system.,2020,01
I love it it's just perfect and the sound quality is so good also the battery life is exquisite,2020,01
This is supposed to be an upgrade from charge 3 but they decided to only put one primary driver in and it shows. Bass response is good but the music sound incomplete. Either stick with the charge 3 or pony up a little more for the extreme 1.,2020,01
"Great portable Bluetooth speaker. Max volume could be better, but certainly recommend the purchase.",2020,01
"I use this at work and it bumps! Love that I can just toss it in my bag and go with it, even set it up in my car. I spilled water in my bag and of course the JBL was fine. Still learning new things about it. I haven’t tested it outside yet, but so far it’s perfect. I’ve been using it for about 2, almost 3 months now.",2020,01
Best speaker out,2020,01
Great little speaker. Good sound for the size.,2020,01
Very good,2020,01
Like the sound the look and the battery life last long long,2020,01
Quality bass,2020,01
"I want to really like this speaker but overall it a good quality sound, not very loud, good bass, looks good. My biggest complaint is the battery. I can't run this speaker for more than 30 minutes unplugged from the wall before the sound is getting chopped as if it's about to die. Really disappointed considering this speaker wasn't cheap.",2020,01
I love this for going to the beach or just hanging out in my back yard- it has a Great sound and I gave a few as gifts!,2020,01
Very Portable and convenient with quality sound,2020,01
Terrible product!  Battery would never last more than 6 hours and after a little over a month it stopped working altogether.  Would not recommend this product.,2020,01
Awesome product.,2020,01
Outstanding sound and bass.,2020,01
Really Loud and clear sound,2020,01
We absolutely love this speaker!,2020,01
Great portable speaker,2020,01
Amazing sound quality and pretty making handling and experience awesome,2020,01
What a speaker.  JBL never disappoints we use this speaker all the time.  Battery life is really good better than I expected.  I recommend this speaker to all.,2020,01
It is compact yet gives very powerful sound quality. The battery life is also decent. I like my new Charger speaker.,2020,01
I ordered the red color but got the grey one. It was a gift but the recipient didn't mind the color. Sound is excellent. Portability and build quality are excellent and connection is smooth and seamless. Used as a sound bar for computer and on the go.,2020,01
"It works great for what I use  it for. I bring it into my shop when I'm working on my projects, or I bring it into the bathroom when I want to relax in my jacuzzi tub. It is plenty loud. But I wish it had a equalizer on the app to adjust the bass.",2020,01
Love everything about it!,2020,01
Great sound.,2020,01
Holds a charge forever.,2020,01
"After my Charge 3 quit charging I was thinking of switching to UE Boom, but I couldn’t. JBL knows what they’re doing and I couldn’t go without the bass. Very good speaker for its price!",2020,01
"It is a little bit, but the sound makes up for it",2020,01
son loved it!,2020,01
Got this for my mother as a Christmas present.  And she uses it every day and absolutely loves it.,2020,01

Great product and powerful sound! Easy to use and very portable. Recommend getting a hard case for it.,2020,01
Great speaker.  Esp if you live near the beach.  Loud with good quality sound.  Can link a bunch of them  together for surround sound anywhere.,2020,01

Beautiful fast shipping,2020,01
Great sound and great battery life,2020,01
Love this speaker.,2020,01
Nice sound,2020,01
Good speakers for a standard sq feet in a room or space. I don’t have to charge it often. I’ll say Ill still be fine almost up to 4/5 days because I’ll only use it for 2/3 hours. I wish it came with a strap to hold it or a speaker case at least for travel. A worthy small speaker with a good sound and base.,2020,01
"We absolutely love the speaker. Great sound quality, battery life is amazing",2020,01
I like the fact that I can connect it with my wife and daughter's JBL Flip 4,2020,01
"Great speaker. Gets super load, long lasting battery. Easy to sync up to our Google Home and phones.",2020,01
Great speaker. Love that it links to other JBL speakers.,2020,01
"Sound is GREAT! It has good sound force, size is perfect, very lightweight. The color Red is a really nice color.",2020,01
Superbb,2020,01
Deep bass for a small speaker. Also has great sounding highs too. I use it 10-12 hours a day at work and it doesn't disappoint at all.,2020,01
"Perfect size and sound for small to medium size areas . I drive a truck and use it to listen to podcasts and music on my nightly run from Atlanta to Nashville and back . I also use it out in my wood shop , I like having the same sound quality in the places I spend the most of my time . It's super easy to pair up . Very durable , i just toss it in my backpack without any type of protection and it does  just fine . Highly recommend !",2020,01
"Great speaker, take it anywhere! (As long as you have the space for it) it's a big speaker but it's honking battery life let me use it and charge my phone with it at the same time. Literally a great speaker.",2020,01
"Great all around speaker, sound, battery life, price and portability.",2020,01
I bought this speaker 5 months ago because I had the JBL Charge 3 before that worked forever and I enjoyed it. But this one suddenly stopped charging and now doesn't work in less than 6 months. very very disappointed,2020,01
"It's a great combination of excellent JBL quality and compact, stylish looks.  The sound is incredible for such a small package.  Great features and an excellent price.  Highly recommended.",2020,01
Is great,2020,01
Just like described. Very pleased. We also had an issue with not getting our first speaker I reached out to the company and they were so willing to work with us to get a replacement sent out asap. I would highly recommend this company and product without hesitation!,2020,01
"Great sound, portability and battery life!",2020,01
Great quality of sound!!,2020,01
Awesome little speaker for traveling or hanging out by the pool,2020,01
"Honestly, still a better speaker than the black round harmon kardon i got from sprint. 100%",2020,01
Everything bad sound is wack,2020,01
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. So far, so good as far as quality, workability and battery life.",2020,01
"Most to all iPhone EQs sound good on this speaker. However, the bass could be a touch louder. Other than that, it’s a bit heavy so when I take it places it usually ends up taking up the middle of the passenger seat or the backseat. Nonetheless, max volume on this thing packs a punch.",2020,01
i got the jbl speaker in the box with the charging cord but not the battery pack as seen on the jbl box,2020,01
Fast shipping. Great sound quality. Good battery life.,2020,01
"Monster sound for something that small although isn’t a quality sound, last almost full day 20 hrs battery.",2020,01

👍,2020,01
Great product,2020,01
Son says he likes it.,2020,01
"Definitely a steal at 99 dollars, love Black Friday specials.The JBL charge 4 is just the right size to get a good audio and still be able to take it on the go. I have the flip, the extreme and now the charge and this charge is my favorite.This speaker has a pretty long lasting battery while not being huge and unpractical. It has a power bank feature but to be honest I never use it.The sound quality is amazing, this one has a lot more bass compare to the flip.",2020,01
Love the sound and the portability of this speaker. Would buy again!,2020,01

"Christmas give for grandson... Fantastic sound for its size.. easy to use, very portable, use just about anywhere.... much better than the BoomBoxes of my youth!!!",2020,01
Great product,2020,01
"I got a defective speaker that would not charge and the replacement dynamics will take more than a month. It feels like a bought a procedure to ship back a speaker, wait for an evaluation from the factory and then in about a month maybe get a replacement. It might not happen often but it has happened to me and I am very frustrated with the way things are handled.I got the new speaker from JBL, a month later same problem. The thing just won't charge. I never even put it to use under humid conditions... This product is really BAD while the other models of JBL speakers work great.",2020,01
Great sounds.  Long battery life.,2020,01
I bought this for my son. I recently bought the JBL Extreme for myself (which he loved) but wanted a smaller speaker. He uses his Charge 4 regularly and I know it sounds great and we have not had any issues.,2020,01
All good,2020,01
My son in law says it's awesome,2020,01
Bought this for my girlfriend for christmas. I did a lot of research and decided on this bluetooth speaker. the sound is fantastic which I figured it would be coming from JBL. she uses it with no issues. Connects right away and sounds fantastic.,2020,01
"I’ve had the speaker for about 2 and a half weeks and probably played 10 hours of music on it. I went to turn it on today and noticed the music was grainy sounding and lacked bass. At first I thought maybe I could be wrong that it didn’t sound as good as I thought. I went and checked others reviews and Charge 4 issues and many people are experiencing this issue. The JBL website warns about buying from unauthorized dealers and stated that counterfeit speakers have the exact same issue I’m experiencing. However, the JBL website lists Amazon as an authorized dealer which is where I got my Charge 4 so I guess I have an authentic speaker that now has turned into a piece of trash after barely any use.",2020,01
My husband bought this for me for Christmas. I love it! I listen to a lot of podcasts and the sound is so good! I also use it in my massage room and many of my clients have remarked at how good the music sounds.,2020,01
It was exactly what I was looking for and has great sound quality. It connected easy with my flip 4s and has created an amazing surround sound for my room!,2019,12
He loved it!,2019,12
👌🏻,2019,12
"Gets loud, but based on previous reviews I assumed it would be LOUD. Sound quality is decent however turned up it has problems. Don’t think you can get better Bass out of a Bluetooth speaker this size however I still want a bit more.",2019,12
Really like the size of this speaker. Big sound in a compact size.,2019,12

It sounds good,2019,12
The thing broke on me in two months the JBL is sending me a new one what a pain in the ass,2019,12
Great sound and battery life,2019,12
Perfect size for awesome sound quality.  I bring it with me when I want to play it loud.,2019,12
"The sound is phenomenal. If you pair with another , you practically have stereoThis is just as good as the Bose speaker Bluetooth speaker. These can stand toe to toe with them.",2019,12
Daughter loves it!!,2019,12
Love this speaker is the best thing that ever happened to me,2019,12
Great speaker as always from JBL. I have bought 5 JBL speakers this year alone and I can’t get enough of them. This speaker is perfect for any occasion. Great sound that fills up the room. I’ve had other more expensive Bluetooth speakers and JBL always blows them out of the water.,2019,12
Awesome!!,2019,12
Love this speaker!,2019,12
Great speaker,2019,12

"Our son wanted it for Christmas, so this is part of what he got. He loves it!",2019,12
"I really like this speaker for our kitchen speaker. It sits on a window sill, sounds great, and is super easy to use. What more can you ask for in a small speaker?",2019,12
Great sound quality,2019,12
This thing is a total game changer. My husband and I bbq on the weekends and this magic speaker plays our music for the whole day! Not to mention it’s sturdy and easy to tote around.,2019,12
"Good portable speaker, The only thing and I imagine it happens to all portables, the load is directly proportional to the level of volume you use.  If you use it low average lasts three days or more, if you use it at full power three or four hours at most.  In general good sound and meets what is offered.",2019,12
JBL does it again with a perfect sounding product,2019,12
Great sound and good battery life.,2019,12
Great sound and easy to carry wherever you want to go,2019,12
I like the size and sound output,2019,12
Works and sounds great,2019,12

Best speaker I ever bought worth the money,2019,12
"Best portable speaker. Sound, quality, and battery life is awesome!",2019,12
Great  even at high volumes. I would recommend this product,2019,12
Great product,2019,12
great speaker!! so loud and the sound is beautiful,2019,12
"I use this all the time, battery life seems good",2019,12
"Amazing speaker I own JBL 3 and I got my Dad JBL 4 no issues pairing them together, Bluetooth works like a charm and multi phone support. JBL have always produced quality speakers.",2019,12
"The overall sound quality is nice and loud indoors, but when outside the sound doesn't travel as far as you would think. But for the size of the speaker I was really impressed with the output overall. When paired with a 2nd device, I got the sound i needed and wanted (outdoors). This is a great product. The portability is amazing because of the size and the durability is awesome.",2019,12
"Great sound, wish I would have got myself one too",2019,12
Love it,2019,12
Not sure if I'm using this speaker correctly. I don't think it's as loud as it should be. Do I need to download an update on my computer? Anybody with any ideas are welcome to write me. Thanks. Pat,2019,12
Bought for my 17 year old son and he absolutely loves it!!,2019,12
"We love this speaker, awesome sound with deep bass.",2019,12
"We absolutely love these speakers.  The sound quality is great and the battery lasts for days.  We use it for house parties, at the beach and when we travel.  I highly recommend them and have bought them as gifts for my kids as well.",2019,12
Sounds great! Gave it to my father as a Christmas present and he loves it.,2019,12
Awesome,2019,12
"Got this for my wife. She loves it. Great sound, pairs easily and has enough bass.",2019,12
Worked fine the first few days. Then got a problem where a disgusting sound came out of the speaker.,2019,12
It is amazing sounds great,2019,12
"Nice and light, great sound and I’m very happy with it.",2019,12
Xmas gift. Great so far,2019,12

I purchased this as a Christmas gift and haven’t heard anything negative from the recipient.,2019,12
Excelente producto,2019,12
Sounds great use it everyday around the house.,2019,12
My son loves playing his music and the sound is great.  He loves the speaker and takes it almost everywhere.,2019,12
"This is my first speaker and I love it. I love the bass especially. I like to play my LoFi music at night when I’m doing homework and the sound quality makes the energy in the room feel so much more calm and relaxing. When I’m playing my regular jams on low, I can still hear the bass when I leave the room to go to the other side of the house and it sounds like there’s a party next door. Putting it in the bathtub while you shower makes the sound expand in a way so that makes for an exciting experience. This speaker is a 10/10.",2019,12
Love it!,2019,12
"GREAT PRODUCT, LOVE THE FEATURES, SOUND QUALITY AND DURABILITY",2019,12
"Speaker easily connects via blue tooth to your device, sturdy, waterproof.  Great speaker to tote to the beach, backyard, pool, all over your home.  very easy to use and setup and fair price.",2019,12
Love this thing especially when I go fishing,2019,12
"The food is delicious, the client service is perfect!I can't wait to come back with my children",2019,12
My son loves this speaker. Great gift,2019,12
I love mine. Can hear it all over the house,2019,12
Didn’t seem to be that much louder than my flip 4,2019,12
Great product !,2019,10
Beautiful speaker! I love the dark green color. The sound is crisp and clean. I just wish the volume would go just a tad higher but that’s not really an issue.,2019,12
Not thrilled with this. I returned a Bose BT speaker in exchange for this one. I bought this because I am having hearing issues but sound quality seems a bit “muddy” and fuzzy and didn’t realize until now that the sound is mono. Also the Bluetooth feature seems unstable in my room where I keep the WiFi modem and several other bt electronics. After some research I discovered this speaker won’t function with too much WiFi and bt interference. A bit frustrating. I’m probably going to return. It works well in every room in the house except the room where I need it the most. Tired of playing games every night to get  Bluetooth to work.,2019,12
"Muffled sound, little dead for my liking",2019,12
Great sound but not the better at loud.,2019,12
"The speaker’s battery lasts literally forever and the sound quality is mind blowing! Honestly, any speaker from JBL deserves the praise it gets.",2019,12
"Bought this for my teenagers who loves music. Great sound,Portable, and great charging option. Highly recommend!",2019,12
"After hours of YouTube reviews, and a black friday cyber sale, I decided to go with this large awkward speaker with only decent battery life and ok sound quality. I know now for a fact that the bose is way better. The charge 4 distorts at about 3/4 of max volume and doesnt have the bass like that of smaller devices. Just because you add some flexy vibrating cones on the ends doesnt mean there will be better bass!!!!!!",2019,12

"Yes,  do it,  buy’em.... the audio quality is outstanding. I’m pretty experienced in AV ANS HIGH/end audio,  and these arent disappointingfoe the price.  The range is excellent.  The ability to link multiple units always impresses guest...  I should be sponsored because I’ve had about 8-10 friends buy these once they heard them...  take them to the beach, on vacation,  in hotels,  the park!  Powerful!",2019,12
Just what I was looking for,2019,12
I got this on sale during Black Friday 2019. It was a great purchase. Works for camping trips and for trips to the river. Sound quality is never compromised and the volume goes way up. Great purchase!,2019,12
Wasn't able to link to another speaker. Don't know why. Sounds good but I wish the volume was a little more sensitive. We keep it low in the office but it's a fine line between to loud or to quiet. I like it though.,2019,12
Looks good and has a reasonable weight.,2019,12
Very nice,2019,12
Just the right size. Nice and clear and the volume is perfect. Get two and they connect to each other. Very very nice kick ass sound,2019,12
It's really loud and big. It's portable but not the most portable because of its size. Getting it is a win for anyone,2019,12
not extremely loud but bass is good. pair 2 and its worth the buy.,2019,12
"My husband had the prior version and we loved it so much so that I purchased this with the case to link to his.  We use them everywhere and a lot!!!Charge life is excellent - even better than my husband's.  Individual and linked stereo sound fantastic.  Portability at the beach, by the pool and around the property when we're doing projects and chores great and convenient.  Ease of use for a technical illiterate such as myself ranks A+.So, after an entire summer of almost daily use, I'm giving this a solid 5.",2019,12
Good sound,2019,12
Good product,2019,12
Works grate love the base,2019,12
"sounds great for the form factor.Takes aux in for the odd ball things that may not support Bluetooth (IE Nintendo Switch)Wish it had fast charging capabilities, but legacy USB charging with plenty of power ontap is good enough.",2019,12
Very good,2019,12
verry good,2019,12
I love listening to music while I clean around the house and the JBL Speaker allows me to move freely.  Works well for house parties also.  My mom has a Charge 3 and the music fills her two story home.  Great for the kids as well and easy to use.,2019,12
I use for work only last about 8hours battery not 20 like it specifies,2019,12
Nice,2019,12
Sounds great!,2019,12
It was perfectly fine,2019,12
Great product~ Easy to use- amazing sound!,2019,12
Very good,2019,12
Cool,2019,12
Expected a better sound from the product.,2019,12
Like n outside,2019,12
Nice speaker,2019,12
"Great size, sound quality, and purchase.",2019,12
Better than I thought.,2019,12
"Great sound, goes anywhere and is easy to use",2019,12
"Nice clear loud sounds, great quality.",2019,12
"Better than any other portable speaker I have purchased. Looses quality as volume increases, but you shouldn’t be buying this to fill a large room anyway. I use it as I remodel our house and it functions great!",2019,12
Very happy with the sound quality and volume levels. Love that I can charge my phone with this speaker.,2019,12
Easy to set up. Stable on most surfaces. Charging cord could be longer; perhaps 6 feet long.,2019,12
Good sound quality. Really enjoy this Bluetooth speaker.,2019,12
Got this for my son for Christmas. He was always borrowing my Charge 3. The Charge 4 sounds great and the camo color looks even better in person. The battery life on these is excellent.,2019,12
"The bass was a little bit of a let down, but compared to any speaker I’ve ever had, including my beats pill, it’s great. I hear all the dimensions in the music.",2019,12
Great coloque! Great speaker,2019,12
"Excelent sound quality, the bass is clear and powerful",2019,12
Great sound and easy to use,2019,12
Love the sound quality and ease of use!,2019,12
"Got this unit on sale and paired it with my iPad, worked great!!",2019,12
Very happy with this bluetooth speaker.  Sounds great and easy to carry around.  Seems to have a bit more bass sound than some other brands.,2019,11
Sounds ok but was  Expecting better in sound,2019,11
Excatly what i intended..,2019,11
"I really wasnt expecting this to sound and be as good as it is. I can literally hear the speaker from outside my house. While the bass is the main star of the show, it leaves me a little disappointed that the treble and other minor but important rythms get drowned out a lot of the time. It could also be the music I play so I cant fault it too much. Overall, really glad I got what I paid for and a bit more as well",2019,11
Everyone in my family is impressed by the sound quality for such a little speaker!,2019,11
Battery and sound is amazing. And I love it cuz it’s waterproof.,2019,11
Great speaker,2019,11
Speaker gets super loud for the size. Really enjoyed,2019,11
"JBL has always been a go to for me. Can’t go wrong with this one. I love the color- ocean blue. The bass hits, we all dig it at work! Buy this speaker!",2019,11
The only reason I gave it 4 stars is JBL for some reason changed the plug style from the JBL charge 3. The Charge 3 has a micro usb cord,2019,11
"This was a Christmas gift that was a big hit.  The sound is wonderful and it's very portable.  In a trip to AZ, we simply threw it into our computer bag and it went right with us. We've had one initial charge and it's been playing for days.  For the Bluetooth, we used JBL Charge 4.",2019,11
"Previous versions of this speaker have MUCH better sound quality. I was very disappointed in the sound of the bluetooth audio coming through this speaker. Also, the delay between multiple speakers playing the same song is very noticeable when you link these speakers together",2019,11
"I originally ordered my Granddaughter the JBL Flip 4 as a surprise gift.  On Dec. 23rd, I asked her what her main gift she hoped she received.  She stated the JBL Charge 4!  I ordered it while waiting for the train at 3 PM and had it by 3 PM Dec. 24th!!  Perfect gift!",2019,11
"Its loud, clear and portable,  just what I wanted.",2019,11
Has good sound for a portable speaker. Bluetooth hooks up good. Works great for golf carts.,2019,11
great for a party,2019,11
Loud bass and vibrant audio quality,2019,11
Love my speaker. This is the best. And its so loud!! Love it,2019,11
Satisfied.....i have two and use the connect plus.....,2019,11
Great product and the seller  is highly  recommended,2019,11
the sounds not so good but loud enough.My main issue was connection to my computer speaker. I had to restart my computer whenever I change from my bluetooth ear phone to this speaker.,2019,11
"if it werent for the battery life and ability to charge other devices, I would give this a 3-3.5. bass response and loudness is ok, definitely not bad. its better indoors than outdoors. waterproofness is exceptional, spilled a cup of starbucks on it and it was unfazed hahaha. its a lil chunky- if ya got big hands its not a problem to carry around but it is hefty in weight. just wished it had 360 sound :(",2019,11
"The battery lasted about 11 hours, not the 20 as advertised. The sound is fine I guess; it’s really treble-y and there isn’t a way to adjust it. Overall, disappointed in this speaker.",2019,11
These are very easy to set up and sound incredible.  Easy to link several together also,2019,11
Not sure why people are not giving this all 5 stars. This sound on this thing is wild and that fact that it’s waterproof is amazing. I love it.,2019,11
We live the jbl flips small and large. Sound so much better and are louder than my BOSE mini sound link.,2019,11
Nice color and strong base.,2019,11
An adequate portable wireless speaker for a small apartment or living room,2019,11
Nice sound and the size is great and portable .,2019,11
"The Charge 4 has ONE speaker in the front left side. The Charge 3 had two speakers and I assumed the 4 would keep this design. The sound quality is fine, but the build of the speaker is misleading.",2019,11
Got this for Christmas and I’m so very happy with it.  The sound quality is amazing and get VERY loud.,2019,11
Love it,2019,11
Excelente!,2019,11
"This speaker plays loud and clear! With family members owning other JBL speakers, we connected them all together for a concert sound at our backyard Christmas party.Great product!!!",2019,11
Everything about this speaker is awesome.,2019,11
Phenomenal,2019,11
"I've tried other JBL bluetooth speakers in past years. To be clear, I've tried many dozens, listened for hours, tested, usually reviewed, and I've kept the ones that I think have something special, good sound. I thought after a few more generations JBL may have figured out how to nail together a decent thing. I was wrong.Buy a Bose Soundlink Mini. Listen to it. Figure out how to do better than that. It has half the volume of this thing and sounds indisputably bigger, better.JBL, don't cry. Bose also completely beefed it with their own new-generation ""Revolve"" speakers. They had spectacular speakers in the Soundlink III and especially, the brilliant and nonpareil Soundlink Mini, and decided to make the awful Revolve speakers. They may get a notch louder, and sound like muddy garbage. But it's round, and that makes it better for parties. Congratulations, we've discovered Idiocracy. Sony is even worse leading the charge into irrelevance, starting with the SRS-X5 and ""improving"" it by making the SRS-XB40. Great bass for a speaker its size, if only great sound was produced by bass alone. It doesn't produce any midranges or treble. Speakers by idiots, for idiots.Anyway, JBL has never made a great bluetooth speaker, so I suppose a 4th generation speaker that still sucks isn't really giving anything up. I just want the world to know that this speaker just ain't great. There's better, richer, more articulate deep and mid bass in the Bose Soundlink Mini, at half the size. It's not waterproof, and I suppose, people who need speakers with round cabinets probably also need to listen to music around pools most of the time, and can't figure out any effective way to prevent their speakers from falling in, so... maybe the JBL is great. For a certain type of person.",2019,11
Easy to carry around.,2019,11
Great sound quality!,2019,11
Like it,2019,10
"Ok, clearly this device is not an audiophile one. Arguably, no Bluetooth device is I guess. But really the high-end is very lacking. Almost muffled sounding. The  low-end is decent for a device this size, but it depends on where  and how you position it. Against a wall or corner tends to resonate better and gives better bass. Placed on the floor does the same.And as others pointed out, this is a mono device.",2019,10
Battery stopped accepting a charge after 9 months of use. Submitted warranty request to JBL. Will see...,2019,10
Love the sound quality really happy with this purchase. There’s enough evidence and reviews on YouTube to show how good these speakers are.,2019,10
"I had high expectations for the JBL Charge 4, because it has a lot of competition and gets good reviews. It's not exactly cheap, either. This implies that the Charge 4 should be, optimistically, almost as good as a Bose (for example). Unfortunately not.Call me sonically spoiled. I use Yamaha HS5 and HS8 monitors, on isolation stands, at home. My truck has a Bose system that delivers bass, mids, and highs like a reference system. I've heard plenty of Bose bluetooth speakers, and they've sounded good. I'm used to hearing everything, crisp and clear. Having said all of that, many people will hear this speaker and be blown away by the quality. It's not terrible, and it actually sounds good in stereo with two connected together. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Stereo mode is very unreliable and wonky.With a single Charge 4, the highs and mids sound pretty unappealing. The best word I can think of to describe its overall sound is ""flat and sloppy, with punchy bass."" The sound stage is disappointingly one-dimensional -- unless you buy a second one and use JBL's ""JBL Connect"" app to run them in stereo. Stereo Mode gives these Charge 4's an instant drastic improvement in sound, but my speakers switch out of Stereo Mode and into Party Mode (dual mono) every time I switch between apps, and sometimes just from hitting Pause for a second! This should have never made it past QA at JBL. I didn't know that was happening at first, but I did notice that things went from sounding great to sounding terrible, even with two connected. That's Party Mode. It's two copies of the same sounds, right on top of each other. I don't want that; I want Left and Right speakers that work reliably. Stereo Mode gives a wide stereo image, and somehow balances out the lone Charge 4's inadequacies a bit... But I can't even count on it to work properly.To summarize, I think the Charge 4 has potential to make a good-quality Bluetooth audio solution, but only if you plan on buying two and only if JBL improves Stereo Mode functionality right away. The app should remember which mode the speakers were on, and keep it that way... Or let us choose a default mode. Either would help tremendously.",2019,10
"I searched and researched forever before buying this one. I’m glad I did! The sound quality is amazing, the battery last forever, and it’s water proof. It’s not too bulky and portable.",2019,10
Love my new speaker and the fact that it is PINK!,2019,10
Nice gift!,2019,10
"Picked white colour and i love it so much - very stylish and cool.Great music quality with strong base, and the volume is high enough, and this is my first time to purchase JBL - unexpectedly good experience.Highly recommended!",2019,10
"Great sound quality, good battery life, easy to connect. Little heavier and bigger than I was expecting.",2019,10
Superd!,2019,10
Nuthin,2019,10
Amazing sound,2019,10
The there is only 1 speaker facing the front and its reall small. Battery life is not 20hr maybe on lowest setting with an aux. I use this at work on 80% volume when using bluetooth will last only 8hr,2019,10
Works perfectly. Battery lasts a really long time. Excellent sound quality.,2019,10
Small portable great sound!,2019,10
Amazing! Can’t believe I didn’t get it sooner! This goes everyyyyywhere with me!,2019,10
Size is good,2019,10
Good job,2019,10
Perfect for parties,2019,10
You get fantastic sound quality for a pretty good price! Hands down the best $114 I’ve ever spent.,2019,10
"Plain and simple this is a good quality, loud and portable Bluetooth speaker.  I think if you want to get the job done the jbl line is it. In the year I've had it I've inspired a few friends to get their own after hearing and enjoying it.  I don't fuss with eq or other features because this is my portable ""party"" speaker and out the box it's tuned just fine for that.  If you want the best sound quality with stereo and more settings you should will probably need to spend more than what this is to get notable improvement.",2019,10
Love it,2019,10
Awesome sound from a small package,2019,10
I purchased one of these about 8 months ago for regular use. I found the sound quality to be very good. I owned an older JBL speaker that failed within 2 months. The warranty return was a hassle so I am pleased that this model has performed well. I prefer that tactile buttons as it makes it easier to find buttons in a dark situation as well as while driving. I also like the USB C connection. The older JBL with a micro USB port failed from wear and tear. I can no longer charge that one and repairing it is not cost effective. The only demerit I can say is this unit is a bit heavy to carry around and listen to music. It's more for placing in a static location. I do want to note the sound does tend to come from one side of the unit. It's not 360. It also isn't a stereo speaker; That means one driver with channels merged. Not important for me. The phone app allows for creating stereo sound from 2 individual units. I verified that. I purchased a 2nd unit during the holiday sale and would recommend this speaker to a good friend.,2019,10
Excellent battery life so far. Right out of the box with no charge it lasted 20 hours straight. Sound quality excellent. a little larger and heavier than I thought it would be.  Perfect for working in a kitchen but a little too big for my disc golf bag.,2019,10
best speaker i've ever bought,2019,10
I like the sound 🎼🎼🎼🎶🎶🎶,2019,10
Excellent product,2019,10
Amazing,2019,10
Overall happy but wish the bass was little more powerful,2019,10
I use an Alexa and love the sound but needed something portable and this just did it without compromising sound quality.,2019,10
"Great sound, especially for the money! A plus for any gathering, indoors & outside!",2019,10
Family time entertainment: we use up battery quickly,2019,10
The speaker is very awesome with great quality sound. It is bright red so it does not get misplaced any where in the office. the portability of the speaker is pretty amazing too.,2019,10
Works great 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼,2019,10

"I bought it for my husband for his job, he works on a pipeline and it’s definitely loud enough to hear it!",2019,10
Its Pretty Dope!,2019,10
Great,2019,10
I love this speaker! The battery lasts for a good while. I charge it once a month and I use it for about 30 minutes each day during the week. The quality is great. I’ve had absolutely no problems with mine. I’d buy another one if something happened to the one I have.,2019,10
It sounds great,2019,10
"A little quiet for my intended use (high noise environment) but great sound for the price, portable and durable. Battery doesn't last super long when at full volume but can run off the cord.",2019,10
Perfect speaker!,2019,10
Lasted almost 7 months before it started to screech at a decibel that was like nails on a chalkboard,2019,10
Great speaker. I had a second version UE Boom. This blows it out of the water,2019,10
Battery life sucks says 20hrs when you only get 6 in full volume. 👎,2019,10
"Awesome sound, good size",2019,10
Great sound and battery life. It has fallen a few times and still is as good as new.,2019,10
"I loved this speaker. Everything about it was amazing. I went to charge it for the first time today since purchasing it and unfortunately no LED flashing, no charge. I’ve tried doing a factory reset, changed charging cables and adapters, everything that I could and still not charge.",2019,10
I’ve had the jbl 4 for a year now and it messed up on me. I haven’t damaged it in any way and it has difficulty turning off and on. Don’t recommend this speaker.,2019,10
JBL is great,2019,10
"Great sound, I love my music.",2019,10
"Work, movies and meditation",2019,10
"I've been using this speaker for a couple of months now, and the sound quality is awesome! Really recommend it.",2019,10
"Bought this one thinking it was the bigger one before the Boombox. Turned out to be the next one after the Flip. I had a Flip before. This Charge sounds just like it. It's basically a Flip with extra battery life. If your looking for a bigger sound, go with the Extreme or Boombox.",2019,10
Great product. Very durable and the battery life is a huge plus. It’s fallen off tables and in water and not a dent on it or any change in sound.,2019,10
"No Usb-C Cable, no Quick Start Guide came which both are offered with the JBL. About the battery life is too early to tell. Otherwise everything is fine.",2019,09
Great product,2019,09
"Way better than I expected but still a amazing speaker. Can change my phone. I don’t turn the vol to the max because I want life of the speaker. We go camping a lot, so far it’s lasted a good 10hrs of nonstop music play vol medium high and did good along with charge two iPhones XR and XS. Can’t complain at all.",2019,09
good qualityFast ShippingThank you,2019,09
"This was an upgrade from my old JBL Charge 2, and what a difference! The Charge 4 is superior in every way! The base is better, the sound quality of the music is better, the build is better!",2019,09
I use when on the run. Something to blue tooth with.Great product.,2019,09
Good value for your money. Like the sound and volume level.,2019,09
i use this at work and it works perfectly,2019,09
Very good product,2019,09
Best portable speaker ever!!! I purchased from a store not Amazon but this speaker is perfectttt. JBL is killin it because their Bluetooth headphones I have are amazing too!,2019,09
This speaker has exceeded my expectations. Way louder than I expected. Often being asked to turn it down.,2019,09
Great 👍🏻,2019,09
Bought this based on a recommendation and would absolutely recommend it to everyone looking for a great quality and portable bluetooth device,2019,09
Great Bluetooth speaker! I’ve had others that can’t even even come close to this one.,2019,09
Sounds great.  Looks great. Portable and with nice design. Easy to use. Would recommend to others.,2019,09
"I returned the JBL Charge 4 for two reason. First, to my ears the sound has too much bottom. Music sounds muddy and the higher end is lost due to too much bass. Unfortunately, there's no way to adjust the bass and treble. What you hear is what you're stuck with. The second reason for my return is the awful electronic sound effects that play automatically when you turn the device on or off. Regardless of your streaming volume these sound effects are loud (and completely unnecessary).",2019,09
Excellent speaker with great sound quality. Would 100% recommend to someone who is looking for a mid sized portable bluetooth speaker,2019,09
Its nice to carry around as a portable charger that can play music. As for sound quality your better off purchasing the flip4 which outperforms the charge 4. The only upside I found was. That the charge was better and deep tones. Flip4 for the win,2019,09
Don’t get the white one.... it gets dirty fast.,2019,09
"Prior to this, I had a JBL flip for a few years before it finally died. I decided to go for this charge rather than another flip since I wanted a little more volume out in the garage. This Charge has surpassed my expectations. It’s significantly louder than the flip, but never loses clarity even at high volumes. The audio is clean, and bass is very good as well.The biggest surprise has been the battery life. I feel like the speaker gets used constantly, but it only needs to be recharged once a week or so.It’s also waterproof, which makes it super easy to clean.All in all I couldn’t be happier.",2019,09
Great speaker,2019,09
Soun good,2019,09
Love this speaker,2019,09
Perfect,2019,09
Perfect for work. Used 3 days without charging.,2019,09
We bought three of these for a Christmas party.  They can be linked and volume can be controlled individually.  They sound great and lasted the whole party without having to be charged.  They are small enough to not be cumbersome but large enough to fill a room with sound.  Very impressed for the money.,2019,09
"Great sound quality, great volume options, love that it’s Bluetooth and easy to connect to and charge. Good battery life. Couldn’t live without this!",2019,09
"The JBL is a really good speaker. It surpasses my expectations and it has great sound quality. With phone settings, you can switch up the sound to your satisfaction. I am impressed with the tracking too. I love this product and I will continue to use amazon for most purchases. Overall I would absolutely recommend this product to others. But make sure you have the right charger and buy a case for it so it's easy to carry around",2019,09
"Bought it on black Friday. The sound is little bit blurry that might be due to waterproof function. Sound format only supports SBC which is the most disappointed thing. Overall i would rank it above average considering the promotional price on black Friday, and suitable for those who like bring their speaker for outdoor activities.",2019,09
"I really love the bass it gives out for a good sized speaker, I was expecting a little more boom but overall it's a great sounding speaker that hits a pretty decent high sound level.",2019,09
Great Product,2019,09
"I have two of them, both speakers are popping.They lasted little over a year each. Will not purchase again.",2019,09
Great  and I love it,2019,09
I like the Charge 4. This is my second one. You can pair them together for stereo sound using the JBL app.,2019,09
A faster delivery and an excelent product.,2019,09
"I had an original JBL Flip for years. Recently the battery started dying so I decided to upgrade. I am so happy I did. This speaker sounds great, and is very loud, and crystal clear.The other upgrade is they went away from their own proprietary charger and now simply use a usb USB you can charge it anywhere even in a car. I love this change.This is a definite upgrade from the JBL Flip in sound production! It is also much larger though. If you are good with the size and are considering this speaker, do it!If I have any issues I will come back and update my review,  but if it's anything like my last JBL, you wont hear from me.",2019,09
Upon opening  this speaker I noticed  it comes in very nice box. The speaker seems durable and sounds amazing ( when it works right ). I only had this for 3 days. I used it the 1st day worked great. Come the 3rd day not so much. It will play but cut out intermittently during songs. Speaker stays on it just literally stops when it wants to and plays when it wants to. I figure I got a lemon so I'll  try another. Might I suggest  don't  bother talking with support they will drive you insane. Just replace and move on.,2019,09
"I would't be as bothered by the fact the Charge 4 switched to mono if they would've at least centered the damn speaker! Blows my mind. The majority of people that buy this will probably think the thing is broken because of that. No way I would pay full price for the Charge 4 when the 3 is stereo, much cheaper, and likely sounds better.",2019,09
Works great and has more deeper bass than the charge 3,2019,09
Love it,2019,09
This is my first high quality Bluetooth speaker.  I am totally blown away by the sound and the battery life.  I bought the big red one and really like it. The Charge 4 is much bigger than the Charge 3. I have a charge 3 case and it's a tough fit.  This speaker is really cool!,2019,09
It's super amazing! It's so nice to play your music wherever you go! I definitely recommend the buy!,2019,09
Not very loud at all,2019,09
Good,2019,09
"Only negative, it does not have mic",2019,09
Not as loud as I wanted it to be great for a room,2019,09
Great,2019,09
"Very nice work done on these speakers!The sound is rich and beautiful. The bass function is amazing! It last long. The battery charge indicator is perfect and very useful. These speakes las very long on a single charge.The only thing is a little uncomfortable is the portability. It's big and heavy and no handles - you will have to buy a carrying case separately. It's too big for easy portability.But overall I am very satisfied with this device. I am buying two next time, I gave this one to granma. Next time i will buy two to pair up. It's worthy! Very amazing sound!!!",2019,09
👍💯,2019,09
"After I bough this speaker another friend was so impressed that he bought one too. It produces great sound quality, I can take it in any environment (beach), and it has plenty volume to fill the air with nice full sound.",2019,09
"Great speaker sound and bass is perfect, & clear. I use it on my boat so its water proof and holds a change all day for me on the water. I really enjoy it..",2019,09

"For the size, this speaker is great.",2019,09
"I have had the Flip 4 for a year and can't say one bad thing about this product.  The sound is amazing, excellent bass.  You can turn up the speaker as loud as you want, no distortion.  Range is at least 60 feet.  My laptop that is the source is inside near a window. Unbelievable range.  I have only run out of battery twice after 5 hours of usage.",2019,09
Okay,2019,09
Poor sound quality,2019,09
This speaker is AWESOME!! Better sound than some of the bigger ones and easy to move anywhere you want!,2019,09
"Much better in all categories than the Bose SoundLink I had before. I've had this for a few months now and no complaints, this little speaker produces great sound and a lot of bass.",2019,09

Good audio quality. Very simple operation.,2019,08
Best speaker out there for the money.,2019,08
Love this speaker. Great sound quality and I love being able to charge my phone with it. It also doesn’t have a loud and annoying power on greeting that some other brands have.,2019,08
"This model is more so for bass. If you love bass... this speaker is perfect for you in every way. However, the quality of the actual sound could be improved. It’s exactly like the reviews on YouTube videos and the company videos explained. With all of that said, it’s worth the money and is loud. If you are in a middle school sized gym, and it’s playing on Apple Music, volume turned up completely, it’s heard. I’m just saying, it’s loud. Loud for house, outside activities, especially apartment.Bluetooth connects with no problem.Battery life last as promised for hours... with non stop playing.",2019,08
The clearness & sharpness of sound. Also that it came in camouflage. I'm a vet. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,2019,08
Great speaker. Excellent bass for it's size.,2019,08
I love this speaker soo much. I use It everywhere and everyday. The sound is super loud. I even used It to play music for a kickback and it held its ground and pulled through for me. You won’t regret getting this speaker!!!! Trust me💙,2019,08
Harmon Kardon has better bass fursure and quality is better  The only cool thing about JBL is the water proof 💦  im never gunna be in the water soo they got me on that. Just get a Harmon Kardon 4 onyx round BT speaker trust  me on that one  Plus its big with not enuff bass  like c’mon man foreal  smh🔊,2019,08
Awesome! Very Happy With The Speaker! Sounds much better than my brothers Bose Mini II portable speaker.,2019,08
"Love this for our cabin and playing music around the campfire. Great sound quality, battery lasts forever. The camo was super unique.",2019,08
I bought this for my husband for his birthday gift a week before his birthday. Then gave it to him on his birthday and 3 weeks later it starts acting up and showing fully charged and only playing for an hour or 2 before dying. This item states that it plays for 20 hours when fully charged which is false. I call amazon and since it was a few days out of the 30 day period for a return I had to go to JBL for a manufacturer warranty. They send you a label and said it would take 14 days to determine if it is really defective for them to send a replacement. I am not at all happy with this product. Totally not worth the money. I have had my Bose soundlink for 3+ years and still sounds great and plays for a long time. Will not recommend this product.,2019,08
"JBL charge 4 produces the most awesome high quality sound from a portable Bluetooth speaker I have ever heard from, including larger speakers. You could jam to music or watch a movie with movie theater quality sound. Worth every penny.",2019,08
Great sound,2019,08
"We use it for the workshop environment. Handymen, artisans, and similar workers often hear music or podcasts, and this is really useful when your only other option is using a phone speaker. However, it's still a small portable device and you can still look for something else if you're searching for the perfect audio experience. A home stereo is more suitable if you don't move around to much or if it's not a hassle to load and setup a home stereo every time you leave the workshop to work somewhere else. I'm very impressed with the sound coming from this liter sized device, and taking it on planes or road trips is really what makes it so good.",2019,08
Excelente,2019,08
U can't go wrong with this,2019,08
I lobe this speaker and truly lobe the sound and plan on getting another to complete a stereo sound.  No it does NOT gibe you stereo but sounds good.  What I don’t like is the bee changing prices on the same item done by Amazon.  Bought it a lot cheaper than it is right now.,2019,08
Love howling the battery lasts,2019,08
Lots of bass,2019,08
Sound is excellent Don't know really about the battery life yet has made it through two golf outings for a total of 10 hours of music without being recharged but doubt it will last much longer on one charge at 3/4 volume...not a big fan of the base of the unit very small and rolls around easily,2019,08
Great speaker,2019,08
"I love this speaker! Great volume level. The battery life is very good. Has a great ""Full"" sound.I use mine at the gym playing volleyball, in my car and at home with guests.Seriously can't beat it. :)",2019,08
This was my second purchase. I pared with another Charge 4 to get stereo.  Great sound. The bass could be deeper but it still is acceptable.Two issues are there is no user manual and no wall charger. So to pair two speakers I had to rely on YouTube to set it up. I also had to contact them to get wall charger specs. I'm using one that has a 5Volt/2Amp output.I play the speakers at a medium/loud volume. At best the battery is fairly depleted after 8 to 10 hours.It would be great if they offered a sub woofer.,2019,08
Good quality sound system!!,2019,08
"This was a bit bigger than I was anticipating but I'm not complaining. While that does affect portability slightly it's still very easily transported, especially with the case (sold separately but a worthwhile investment). It's loud and sounds great and the battery life is amazing! There's a bigger, better model for a little more money, but for my needs this works fantastic. I had some trouble with using it while camping, as it seemed to only be picking up mono: you could hear the background music and noises like doors slamming and whatnot but not the dialogue. I'm not sure if the problem was with the speaker, the transmitter, or the TV it was hooked up to. Hooking up Bluetooth headphones the sound was perfect, and hooking up this speaker to different devices the sound has also been perfect, so I don't know where the breakdown was.",2019,08
Great sound quality.,2019,08
Good,2019,08
"I love this thing. The sound quality is good for the size and it’s very portable. Obviously you can just max the volume on it and your phone, it gets distorted like anything else. For the price I pay this is absolutely worth it.  I use this mainly in the bathroom while showering since it beats phone music out of the water. I even carry it to the garage and place it and jam out while working on my car. Considering getting another one of these for a family member.",2019,08
"I believe this is the first time JBL has released the white color for the charge-series speakers. I owned black charge 2+ and charge 3 speakers in the past, and I like all of the them. The black ones look classic, and the white one looks modern and trendy.",2019,08
Bought for a gift for my dad.  He loves it and he takes it everywhere.  Says the battery life is crazy and the sound is just what he was looking for.  Thanks JBL,2019,08
Love it!!,2019,08
Use for work in an aqua aerobics class environment. Works quite well,2019,08
"I have this speaker for 5 months and used it a total of 5 times, it stays in a case in my room always... somehow it has stopped working, it is not charging and switches off after a couple seconds. One light blinks consistently during charging but it isn’t charged. I will not recommend anyone spend this amount of money on a speaker that will just stop working",2019,08
I like my Charge 4 so much I just bought a 2nd one.  I keep one by my easy chair and one by my bed.  I unplug it and keep it near me when I do chores around the house or in the yard.  It sounds great and is easy to use.,2019,08
"This thing is awesome! Great sound, good battery life.",2019,08
Love it,2019,08
"I bought this because I wanted a portable speaker with an old-fashioned aux input. Unfortunately the aux input has a horrible flaw. If a couple seconds of silence go by in whatever you’re listening too, the speaker shuts off and only starts back up after it gets some signal again. You’ll lose about a half second of audio as it turns on again too. Like let’s say you’re listening to an album, a couple seconds of silence between tracks is enough to cause this and you’ll lose the first little bit of the folllowing song because it shuts off and then turns on again only after something loud enough to turn it back on again happens. So so annoying! After a little Internet sleuthing, I found out that this is just how they are. Apparently, you can fix it by shorting a chip on the motherboard, but I’m not doing that. Returning it. RIP JBL. Really dumb.",2019,08
Very good speaker,2019,08
Very loud,2019,08

"I super love this JBL speaker, my uncle had bought a speaker (not this one) and it cost him $300 and it was bigger than this one supposedly it's one of the best brands and honestly? It's as loud as my uncle's and this was cheap. I use the speakers almost every day and it lasts almost like 2 days and a half sometimes three and it charges pretty fast. I don't regret buying this speaker, super love it!",2019,08
Great speaker.,2019,08
I use it on the Golf Course and Boating,2019,08
I have several friends with JBL's so I knew what I was getting. But I don't know how I lived my life before just listening to music on my phone day to day!! Haha.,2019,08
It’s great!,2019,08
awesome product. excellent gift and they have many colors,2019,08
My son loves it,2019,08
Got this so I can pair with my charge 3. Works great. Louder and better sound than 3. Will always go jbl. Can't beat for the price.,2019,08
Great sound. And great battery life. We listen to this on our patio and couldn't be happier with it. My 19 year old son keeps taking it so I think we will have to get him one for Christmas.,2019,08

Great product but bring a charger the battery only really lasts for 6 or so hours,2019,08
Got for my husband. He loves it,2019,08
Like the sound and delivery of music.,2019,08
It does not bring the wall charger as the Charge 3 did. Minimum cost for manufacturer but a big problem for the consumer!!! I hope they are not trying to put quality down in all components as well.,2019,07
Great sound quality and easy to transport.,2019,07
This device does play in stereo I’ve seen several reviews say that it doesn’t. But I can verify you will hear the various channels in the music. You won’t regret getting this just be very gentle with the cable that charges it and the plug ins. Don’t power jam the buttons. It doesn’t require an ape-like approach to use this speaker. When you press the power button there’s a delay. Lightly press and listen/feel for the button to click then just wait a few seconds. It will come to life. Battery life is awesome. I use it every day at the office for 8 hours and I charge it maybe twice a week. Good product. Yes it’s stereo. Anyone who says otherwise doesn’t have the ears and intelligence to know what stereo really is.,2019,08
Well rounded speaker!Very good,2019,08
Best speaker out there. Battery life lasts forever and the sound is amazing.,2019,08
Was 120$ when I purchased.It's 180$ now.Glad I took it early.,2019,08
"Love the sound, portability, and the look of the speaker. A good value for the money!",2019,08
Great speaker.  Sounds amazing.  My only gripe is the volume.  Every time I go up or down there is a pretty big difference.,2019,08
Best speaker I have ever had,2019,08
Very loud and has fun features!,2019,07
Sounds great but not for the outdoor construction workers.,2019,07
Sounds great but the only reason I bought it was because of the advertised battery life of 20 hours. It lasts 8 hours. Charged out of the box for the whole night. Took it to work and turned on at 9:30am. It played music until 6:06pm when it died. Very disappointed. I am returning it for my money back.,2019,07
Works great,2019,07
Bose who?? Why spend so much money on Bose or these other brands..I was a bose fan for most my life..all my vehicles and sound systems in all my vehicles added the bose sound package..the only speaker I actually believe puts out better and louder sound quality for less than half the price.. let alone the battery life and the charging abilities..over 20 hrs of battery life and includes a power back built in to hook up your cell phone or even Alexa to play your tunes.. Best speaker for the price..would have spent even more on it..,2019,07
Really nice sounding speaker.,2019,07
I'm so glad I got this.  It's easy to use and the sound is fine.  I've had it for 3 months and no problems so far.  Wish I had gotten it sooner.,2019,07
Exelent!,2019,07
Awesome speaker,2019,07
We bought two and working as expected so far,2019,07
This thing sounds AMAZING!,2019,07
"This speaker has amazing sound, great battery life and fits anywhere you need it. I recommend it for any use, in house or outdoors!",2019,07
I like that you can charge your phone while you listen to music.,2019,07
"Great portable speaker. good sound, durable and not too expensive",2019,07
"Initially, my preference was the Bose Soundlink Mini II with its smooth notes and decent sound quality in a small transportable package; that is, until I heard comparison against a JBL Charge 4 on YouTube. Based on that review and others, I purchased this speaker for its waterproof, multi-connect and sound.Great price:  You can buy a Charge 3 direct from JBL for $129 with 12 color options, with price point being on par with Amazon.Sounds great; EXCELLENT better describes it.  If you have a Charge 3 there isn't enough improvement to justify buying a Charge 4.  The Charge 4 went from two smaller speakers to one slightly larger speaker which improved bass frequency from 65Hz to a deeper 60Hz.  When the JBL arrived we conducted our own comparison against a  Bose Soundlink Mini II and - Wow.  The Charge 4 is much clearer, has better frequency response and has better sound presence in the room.  It's a bit larger and heavier than the Soundlink Mini II which might turn some off, but to me; if I'm going to carry any speaker like this then I'm taking the same care and am sure I can find just a little more room.Good packaging but NO INSTRUCTIONS?!  Not that charging and setup are all that difficult, but this is my first device that requires USB C, first anything that arrived with ZERO printed information, and rechargeable device that arrived with ZERO anything to charge it with.  ///  Setup was easy.  I bought a USB C cable from the nearest gas station and plugged it in for 3 hours since it came somewhat charged already.  Once charged, press the Bluetooth button then connect to your phone or other device.  For settings, I always recommend phone volume to be no more than 1/2 to 3/4 volume then using the Charge 4 volume from there. This affords you plenty of up/down volume adjustment remotely from your phone and doesn't task the internal sound processor....this, since it's cheaper to replace/repair a Charge 4 than an expensive smartphone.  You and someone else can be Bluetooth paired to this speaker at the same time.Battery Life:  The built-in rechargeable Li-ion 7500mAH battery is strong.  Not only does it support up to 20 hours of playtime (at lowest setting, and figure 10 hours at half volume), but it will also charge your phone and other devices via the USB port.  I strongly suggest buying a protective case for it which will hold your charger, USB C charging cable AND any spare USB cable needed for cell phones.It has the same IPX7 waterproof as a iPhone, Samsung or other higher end smartphone.  We place it on the deck without any worries of accidents from fluid spills, big splashes, being left in the rain, or even an accidental swim in the pool.  Having that peace of mind alone is priceless.JBL Connect+:  With Connect+ you can connect several of these to together for full sound experience.  Put 4 in opposing corners of a large room, in different rooms, indoor and outdoors...heck, even in your car if your current stereo or speakers are crap.Bottom line - this being my FIRST Bluetooth speaker ever, and having friends that have made different choices for the speakers they have, I have zero regrets with my purchase after hearing it beside theirs.  Bang for buck is spot on.  I have excellent sound in a transportable package in a wireless speaker that is rugged, waterproof and allows multiple speakers as well as people to connect.  I now proudly own the party favorite speaker for socials, events and private enjoyment.  WIN!",2019,07
Bought for my son’s 14th Birthday. He loves it! Great sound quality and battery lasts forever! Definitely worth the money.,2019,07
Battery life is shorter than advertised on this speaker other than that it connects quickly through Bluetooth and has a full sound,2019,07
"It got wet and had no issues. Battery life is great, lasted all day.",2019,07
I love having this speaker good quality,2019,07
should be bigger. haven't had it long enough to tell much. dont think ill be able to hear it on my harley,2019,07
Camping fishing yard work 😋🤘😉,2019,07
For the size it’s got a nice punch to the bass but the high ends are slightly muffled,2019,07
"Sound quality is absolutely great.  For its size it can really fill a space.  Sometimes I leave it playing in my room and go outside and it almost sounds like I have a whole mini hi-fi stereo system in there.  The bass is very good but can also be tremendous if you position it right.  Place it in a corner where it can bounce the sound off the walls etc and prepare to be amazed.  It's slightly bigger than the charge 3 but probably the price you pay for bigger sound.  It really hasn't affected the portability for me.  I just throw it in my backpack and go.  It's pretty durable, haven't dropped it but had paint droplets splash on it and was able to wipe it off with a damp cloth perfectly and also sand etc comes out of it easily after a day at the beach.  My only gripe is the single speaker that is contained in the housing is off to one side, so sometimes if you're right in front of the speaker, close enough to it you may hear a bias towards the left side.  Other than that, totally excellent speaker.  I never really charged my phone on it beyond a few minutes but it works, and the battery life feels super long, especially if you're not playing it constantly.  Honestly I'm just excited now waiting to see how JBL is going to improve on this in future models.",2019,07
😀,2019,07
Incompleto,2019,07
It takes to long to charge up fully but overall it’s a good speaker,2019,07
Speaker works as advertised,2019,07
I love this speaker!,2019,07
"Excellent quality product. Very good sound for the size, battery lasts for a long time. Super happy with this product.",2019,07
"A friend of mine had one of these.  I had to get one for myself.  Puts out good sound, and isn't ridiculously expensive.",2019,07
Sound quality not as good as what I was expecting and battery life not as long as advertised,2019,07
i was not Expecting that sound quality for this low price,2019,07
Awesome,2019,07
Great Gift!,2019,07
when i buy the jbl and open de box no coming the charger at for me it bad ítem,2019,07
Great product. Excellent sound.,2019,07
This speaker arrived and it wasn’t even a JBL. It’s false advertising and I would be tricked by purchasing it. Called Amazon and they said there was nothing they can do. AVOID THIS ITEM AT ALL COST. I’m deployed overseas and received a false product and there is nothing they can do? I’m completely disappointed by this. Be aware.,2019,07
The sound was awesome.,2019,07
Perfect,2019,07
"Probably the best portable speaker I have owned.  Great sound quality, lots of volume if needed, and very good battery life.",2019,07
Is amazing!!! ❤️,2019,07
I like everything,2019,07
Charging problems I just got this 5 months ago and is not charging,2019,07
I own at top-of-the-line Bose Bluetooth speaker. A friend needed a recommendation but the Bose was twice the price of the JBL. I imagined the JBL would sound good. It's JBL after all. I delivered the JBL Charge 4 to my friend last night and we were BLOWN AWAY!!! Fabulous sound. Beautiful design. Excellent user interface. WONDERFUL that it's recharged from a standard USB power supply. I'm completely happy that it doesn't come with one. Who doesn't have extras? This JBL product is superb.,2019,07
I like speaker but there is no charger..,2019,07
My husband loves his gift. Quality sound from his JBL Charge 4. He is trying to sync to his JBL Charge 3. Please send email how to do.,2019,07
"Great sound quality, portability and batter life for the price.  Very easy to swith between bluetooth devices.",2019,07
"If you want quality sound to blast while you dance on your own while cleaning the kitchen, or working on a super dope motorcycle in the garage, or while you roast s’mores up the canyon around a toasty bonfire while celebrating the joys of lasting friendships, BUY THIS SPEAKER. It’s small enough to toss in a backpack and big enough to pack an audio superpunch. The battery life is AMAZING and I can go days without charging it. Bluetooth connection is great and you can pair it to multiple devices which is a HUGE win for JBL. 10/10 would buy again.",2019,07
"Love this speaker the sound is amazing the battery life is great plus you can use it as a power bank to charge your usb devices,  as for portability it would be best to buy the protective case with clips, would buy again and again",2019,07
"Sound quality is amazing, although the woofer is off centred and it loses the stage sound its predecessors had.",2019,07
"Compared to Bose and its prices, this one is half the price but as good as the bose! Nothing to complain.",2019,07
Love how loud it gets.,2019,07
I bought this for the home shop and it makes a really nice sound! Love it so far!,2019,07
Super speaker. Sound is great. Easy blue tooth setup. Great value,2019,07
make garage work and  bbq  so much more fun.,2019,07
Excelente,2019,07
Sound is awesome and it pairs well with devices,2019,07
Really love it,2019,07
Always have been a fan of JBL and this little guy doesn’t disappoint. We have 2 of them and they produce excellent sound by the pool.,2019,07
We have used all name brand portable speakers. This one is by far the best so far. Super clear and waterproof.,2019,07
"I liked the brand and the color of this particular item.  I expected better sound quality from this brand,  since I listen to their large monitor speakers @ home.",2019,07
Great speaker,2019,07
The difference between charge 3 and 4 was noticeable and the 4 is worth the extra $!,2019,07
It's great all is good very good.,2019,07
Great sound. It's simplicity is it's key. It is meant to be an outdoor speaker and to fill up a wider area so don't listen to those who complain it's not stereo. Stereo is useless if it's speakers are so close together.It's not too big.The accessories you can buy are good. I like the rubber carry case and the hard case as well,2019,07
i get annoyed with the small things that they cheap out on in speakers and really if i had to find something wrong with it it would be the that the outer edges are plastic and not rubber but they make cases for them so not too big of a deal,2019,06
Excellent range and sound quality,2019,06
"The Charge 4 will connect with Boombox & other Charge 4s. Charge 3 will not connect to anything, so don't bother trying. I bought 2, 1 new & 1 renewed, neither connected. The connect button acting like the blue tooth button. JBL dropped ball on it & fixed it on Charge 4. UE Booms are best for connecting @ their $64 price. Sound quality is better than JBL, but JBL has better base response when you want to play speaker loud.",2019,07
"On the pricey side, but well worth it for my needs. It’s great for filling the backyard with tunes & podcasts while gardening or playing with my two dogs.Pros: loud, clear sound; simple operation; excellent build quality; available in a variety of colors.Cons: could use an EQ in the app, or even a simple Low/Mid/Hi curve control to optimize it for different listening environments; can’t be powered On/Off remotely from app.Summary: we were sufficiently impressed with the Charge 4 that we bought a second unit for garage/basement use.",2019,07
"Great sound, long battery life, very portable.",2019,07
Awesome!,2019,07
The sound is great and the battery last a long time.,2019,07
Great sound and the battery seems to last forever. I only wish you could change songs from the speaker itself but it’s got great quality sound.,2019,07
"Great sound, durability, color .Everything I wanted! Dont hesitate. Buy it already!!",2019,07
"Sound quality is good overall.  I would give it 5 stars if it came with the carrying case as the Charge 3 did.  Overall a nice little speaker for taking to the lake, or camping.",2019,07
"Love, good sound, powerful and stylish!  I do not regret the purchase!  Highly recommend!",2019,07
Good sound fast charging,2019,07
"Cool little speaker, but JBL straight up lies when they say it connects to your other JBL speakers.  They advertise that it connects to up to 100 other JBL speakers, but it isn’t true.  I have another JBL, which is why I purchased this one.  It 100% DOES NOT connect to my other JBL speaker.  I called customer service and they confirm that it will not connect to my other JBL speaker.  It is a complete bait and switch.  Poor, customer service and straight up lies on the part of JBL.",2019,07
OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY,2019,07
Totally recommend this little piece of amazing.,2019,07
This is a great portable stereo. Sound is great and volume can go very high. Glad I purchased.,2019,07
"Very nice. Great sound and works very well for charging a phone. Only 1 drawback, it’s heavy. I think ~3 lb. but I’m happy with it,",2019,07
"Love JBL. and love this JBL, perfect size, has awesome sound quality.",2019,07
As advertised,2019,07
Sounds great in rooms with punchy bass and crisp highs,2019,07
Good quality sounds great.,2019,07
Great sound for a smaller speaker.,2019,07
Great device,2019,07
speaker works and battery life is great,2019,07
Great sound,2019,07
"It is a good speaker, the sound quality is great, no complains about it, it feels really good built and the bass is great, but the volume... it is not as good as i thought would be (not bad at all) because of the speaker size, the batery time claims to be 20 hours of playtime  but i havent try for that long yet, but in general terms it is a good speaker",2019,07
Very Good Product,2019,07
"Unboxed this today and couldn't listen for more than an hour. Muted sound (no treble, just overloaded with bass). Removing the extra bass with the bluetooth/volume-reduction buttons combo to produce a flat sound didn't help. JBL/HK should invest in an EQ app asap to allow users increase the higher frequencies to produce their preferred output balance. I can even live with just preset EQ settings but not this. JBL didn't listen to all the Charge 3 criticisms about sound quality. Very disappointing. Packaging back up to return. Total waste of time",2019,07
"Rich sound, adequate bass and midrange. Its heavier the smaller portable sound devices I have owned, but I don't have to worry about battery life. We take this to the beach and will take it kayaking too.",2019,06
We are obsessed with these speakers.  We had a smaller one for about 5 years and decided to upgrade to the larger speaker.  Best quality and price!,2019,06
"Git is for my husband we love it, we can take it  next to the pool and even charge our phones.",2019,06
My daughter has used this speaker for everything. It is a lot heavier than we imagined but still portable enough to take out to the pool or cheer practice,2019,06
Perfect sound for a small speaker battery life and waterproof can’t beat the price,2019,06
Best speaker ever.. worth every penny,2019,06
Great speaker. Loud for its size,2019,06
"This portable speaker packs big sound in a small package. It offers truly great sound quality, easy/instant pairing to my iPhone, and a nice design aesthetic. I got this to replace a Bose SoundLink that was adorable (and smaller) but finicky when pairing with my phone. I’m very happy with this purchase for poolside tunes!",2019,06
I mainly use it for music.Its Good.,2019,06
 This speaker sounds great 👍Thumpy punchy and in certain instances has deep booming bass. Mids n highs are clear. Could be a little more crisp and of course have more bass but it is a full rich sound and using an EQ brings out more of its capabilities. JBL quality construction.I was on the fence about buying this because they went to a mono driver but you can't really tell a difference in fidelity. You can tell the bass is slightly deeper than the Charge 3. Completely happy with it and love the green color. 😉One thing i do not like is they took away the speaker phone. Put the speakerphone back. That's a thing I like and is missing on this. 🤨 As for connecting to older speakers with connect you can update the older speakers to connect plus to connect with the Charge 4.UPDATE: Liked it so much I got another one. 😁 Camo. These sound great. It actually has bass. 👍 No issues with connectivity or battery. This is the best speaker in this class or category. There are some that come close but these can't be beat. The price hike is a downer. Don't know what's going on there. $179? That's crazy. Got these for $99 and that's what they should be. Seems getting good reviews helps their sales and they take advantage by jacking up the price. 😐 Not cool. At $179 they aren't that great. I would expect more at that price.,2019,06
Great sounding speaker. Deep bass.,2019,06
"I was told that the speaker makes two sounds before playing audio from the other paired device. One for when it turns on via pressing the power button, and another for once it connects to a paired device. I got no sounds from either of actions.I turn the fully charged speaker on. From this point I am supposed to hear sound notifying that the device is on. All I see is the power button light, light up. I then press the bluetooth button, and that lights up too. Then I connect it to my phone (which has connected to other bluetooth devices perfectly fine). I get the notification on my phone that it is connected to the speaker, but no sounds from the speaker notifying that it is connected to the phone.I even reset the speaker, and it still gives no sound.Very disappointed, will be returning.",2019,06
What item do 2 musically hip teenagers want more than any other item? THIS.,2019,06

Great sound. Love it,2019,06
Love this speaker,2019,06
Love this JBL waterproof speaker!  Sounds good and looks good!  If we need another portable speaker we will definitely buy this one again!,2019,06
Sounds a lot better than Wanderboom that I gave away to my dad. Got this instead and I think it's way better!,2019,06
Sounds amazing just not the color I ordered. Only gave 3 stars because I didn’t get the color I ordered I really wanted the blue one.,2019,06
Works perfectly and the bass it has is great!,2019,06
Just perfect!!!,2019,06
This speaker sounds great and has an awesome battery life! Haven't tested the water proofing yet but so far I love this speaker,2019,06
This is an amazing sounding speaker. It has good base but not overpowering. The sound is clear and deep. It is a mono speaker but can be paired with a second one for stereo. I use it at work and am rarely able to go past half way. At full volume with an iPhone 7 (not sure if it matters) it never distorts or sounds scratchy.,2019,06
Nice,2019,06
Love them. Recommend,2019,06
Very nice product!  I received it in two days as promised with Prime.  I only needed to charge it initially for about an hour.  My Samsung phone paired with the speaker in about 15 seconds.  The sound is great and this is just what I was looking for to provide music while I work on projects in the basement and garage.,2019,06
I love it! Great sound and kicking bass for such a small speaker!,2019,06
Color looks exactly as advertised and the charging port and size are perfect! I love it so much definitely worth the .money,2019,06
This jbl charge 4 sounds amazing ! Loud and nice base!,2019,06
Great sound quality for it's size. Easy to connect to phone bluetooth.  Battery seems to go on forever.,2019,06
"I've been around music my entire life including spinning records at top nightclubs where JBL was the speaker of choice. I really wanted to love this speaker but it's not happening. JBL should be ashamed of themselves! The sound quality is horrible. The speaker clips at between 1/2 and 3/4 of the volume using my phone. At 1/2 way, the speaker / music coming out is missing everything including clarity, bass, treble & yes... Stereo. Everyone with reviews complaining about dead music coming out is absolutely correct. The speaker plays dead music especially at higher volumes. Anyone wanting a cheap portable speaker with horrible sound, this is for you. Anyone looking for a great speaker, this is not for you. Yes, you get what you pay for but with today's technology, every speaker should sound great! Take a look at the Marshall Bluetooth Speakers, they're amazing. Also, if you don't need portability, the Klipsch speakers are amazing. Sonos is overrated. I find myself always going back to the good old names from decades ago. Even the Bose Speaker selling for around $160, on sale right now at BB, sounds 100x better than these JBL Speakers. Folks, take a look at the Bose & Marshall BT Speakers. You'll really enjoy the sound especially from the Marshall Woburn II. I have the Bose Soundtouch 30, the speaker blows away every speaker on the market. I also had the Marshall Stanmore hooked up to my phone and computer, it rocked. If you can find the old Bose Acoustic Wave, in mint condition, that was once an amazing speaker too. Hope this review helps you. Thanks for reading it.",2019,06
Crisp clean sound throughout all the ranges. Sounds awesome. I am very pleased with this speaker.,2019,06
Don't know about battery have not had it long.,2019,06
I recommend it.,2019,06
"As far as portable BT speakers go, it does the job. Music comes out, sounds pretty clear, and is loud enough for a small outdoor area.I keep 2 of these by the pool (1 on each side) and link them together with stereo sound.Good way to have music in the pool area without having to wire speakers and such.I'm thinking about getting 2 more in order to cover more area,but these will do for now.",2019,06
"I relly like this speaker, good sound and pretty clear.",2019,06
Love it,2019,06
I don’t like the fact that the speakers came without a charger. I’m not happy because I will need to spend more money to buy a charger for the speakers!,2019,06
Very good product.,2019,06
"Thankfully I didn't buy this from Amazon. I bought it from Walmart. It sounded great, and JBL has always been a favorite brand. They had it for the same price as Amazon, so I took it home and opened it up. As Amazon states, it does not come with a charger, which is a problem because it does not charge with a standard USB charger plug. It also comes with no instructions or documentation. I returned it for a refund. Too bad, because it really does sound great for its size. I guess you really have to go to a big box store so you can hear it and check out how to charge it. I gave it 3 stars for battery life because I really can't judge battery life, since I never got to charge it and use it. I gave it a one star overall rating because if you can't charge it with a standard plug, it's useless.",2019,06
"I did a ton of research before buying this speaker. We use it outside, golfing, at the pool, at the lake. One charge lasted two lake days without sacrificing sound quality. Would highly recommend",2019,06
The sound is great and so are the look and feel. The battery last long but not nearly as long as advertised.,2019,06
Great sound,2019,06
Excellent sound quality with lengthy battery life,2019,06
"We loved our old one and this is the new version.  sounds great, works well.  A little bigger than the one it replaces so not quite as portable.",2019,06
"A lot of people were jumping on this speaker for the fact that it is a mono speaker and I just wanted to stand up for it. You can hardly tell the difference between the 3 and the 4 unless you stand very close. The two stereo speakers in the Charge 3 are just so close together it doesn't really matter and the difference is small. The sound quality is definitely improved however. The mid and highs are not muddy, like the 3's and the bass is slightly deeper, making a very enjoyable sound experience. The only gripe I'd have about it is that it cannot be a speakerphone or connect with Siri or Google Assistant, but that is minimal compared to the improvement of sound quality. If you have the 3, don't upgrade, it still isn't worth it. But if you are deciding between getting the 3 or the 4, get the 4.",2019,06
"Attached it to my bike for RAGBRAI. Works great. I like that its waterproof, has a long battery life, charges my phone if needed and syncs with other JBL speakers (within typical 30 ft bluetooth range). It gets pretty loud when you want it to but note that it only has one speaker so its mono, not stereo sound unless you pair up two of them.",2019,06
Great sound quality,2019,06
The item shipped quickly and arrived as described. Sound quality is great and sound can fill up a room - Not very bass heavy but good balance. I also like the ability to charge other devices.,2019,06
"Probably the best Bluetooth speaker on the market for the price I paid. It slaps AF, & the battery life is wassup. I still haven't dunked it in water, but it's nice to know that if it does get wet. It'll be alright. I would definitely buy this bad boy again.",2019,06
"Excellent product, compared to a Bose this has excellent sound and is waterproof.",2019,06
I love my speaker,2019,06
Bass is very good.,2019,06
"The kids use this all the time. I bought the 3 for me last summer, but they use it far more. Got a second one (4) this year so there is always an extra around.They take it from pool to porch to room to park and repeat. Plenty loud for those around it or around pool. Clear sound at volume and provides full sound even with higher bass music. A lot of bang for the form factor. Practical use is mulitdays-week on a charge so doesn't always need charging and doesn't strand you.Would buy again.",2019,06
"+Sound+Battery life+Build quality-LED's too bright, don't time out+-They have a 'daisy chain' feature you can use, but it's been hit/miss with us.These speakers are fantastic for the price. We bought 2 of the Charge 4, and 1 Charge 3. The only reason these aren't 5-star for us, is that the primary use is in the bedroom to play sleep stories/music. The LEDs for buttons on top never time out while the speaker is turned on, and are SOOO bright in a dark room. Unfortunately, we have to drape something over the top of the speaker to hide the lights. 5 stars if that weren't an issue.As for battery life, I use one in my office all week for conference calls (with a desk mic), and charge it only every other week. Fantastic.",2019,06
Great speaker! I love this thing absolutely the best i have ever had!,2019,06
"Great product, love the long battery life!",2019,06
"It’s the best speaker I ever bought, it has an clear sound and the lost frequency mode is insane, the bass is amazing! The price is good for all the speaker has offers to you",2019,06
"So...bought a JBL 3. It came with case, charging cable and socket adapter.JBL 4 cost more and only came with speaker. Nothing else. Sound quality was the same. Get a jbl 3. Cost less and comes with more.",2019,06
Love this speaker,2019,06
The speaker is amazing! The sound from this little speaker is awesome!,2019,06
"Great spearker! For the size of this speaker it really puts out great sound. The battery life is pretty good, but that depends on the volume you have it at. I haven't tested the water proof abillity yet, and I hope I don't have to. But I have seen videos about it. Overall I highly recommend this speaker, it is a really nice buy.",2019,06
Good for party’s,2019,06
The sound quality is very good and the speaker is portable. I really like that. I bought this for my husband on father's day.,2019,06
"Product performs as stated, Seller was fast and reliable. No issues.",2019,06
"I've taken this thing on the go for a few months now, and it's a great speaker. I purchased it to replace my stolen Charge 3.The quality is very good for most genres, and the bass is something to appreciate.The battery life is outstanding. Sometimes I forget to turn it off (I disabled the power sounds for it and it's easier to forget now) and it will last days of just being on.It's very portable as long as you have a decent-sized bag to carry it in. I used my backpack.Very good purchase.",2019,06
"I had a Bluetooth speaker for 7 years and it finally died, so I needed to find a replacement. After careful research and debate I decided on this model.It looks slightly small, but it packs a punch. I used it the first weekend after arrival at a campsite. The site was booming with music and I was astonished at the quality.The speaker also lasted 2 full days of almost constant use. Definitely my new camping speaker. Added bonus is you can charge phones via the speaker.Overall love the quality of this device. My only gripe is it could be a little bassier.",2019,06
I have purchased a Charge 4 in and I received a charge 3 for some reason. I checked the receipt to double check that I didn’t  accidentally buy a 3. So now I have spent an extra 50 bucks on a  speaker that I did not order.,2019,06
Ease of use,2019,06
It’s perfect for literally anytime you need loud music. Battery lasts forever I’ve charged it only a few times in 3 months and I staaaay drinking at the pool,2019,06
This is a good unit nice bass good sound  but I had a JBL charge three and I do not like that I cannot use the same charging wire for the amount of money that you charge for the GPO charge for it should come with its own charge wire  I should not have to go online and purchase a charge wire separately or a double USB cord let down,2019,06
"Works just like I figured, plenty loud",2019,06
"This is one of the best bluetooth speakers I have used. The battery life is amazing, I only have to charge it like once a week. And I love that you can charge your phone with it also.",2019,06
Love this speaker! Can use it anywhere and in multiple ways. Great buy!,2019,06
I love it,2019,06
Sounds great and it rocks!,2019,06
Ordered this just before we went to the beach. This thing rocks! Sounds amazing. I am blown away by how much power comes out of this little speaker and how clean it sounds even with the volume maxed out. No regrets.,2019,06
I like,2019,06
"Battery didnt last close to even 20h, could of included a sting like with the flip 4.",2019,06
Loud enough for what I needed it for. Battery life depends on how loud you use it. Don’t forget to turn it off when you are not using it and the battery will last longer!,2019,05
How do I return it for repair? Stopped working after only several hours of use. I see it has a 1 year parts and labor but how can I get in contact with someone to return it!,2019,05
"This speaker works good enough for me. Unlike most I bought this because it was a directional speaker. I use it while welding in the shop and don't want everyone to have to listen to my music too. It stays 20-30' away from me and I can hear my music just fine. The battery will last all day (even at high volume) unless you try to charge your phone with it. I got 4hrs with my phone plugged in for half that time. Without using it to charge my phone, I got 10hrs out of it and it was only down one ""dot"" out of 5. Overall the sound is decent. Worth the money if you get it on sale.",2019,05
Great bass sound,2019,05
Love it,2019,05
I like the color I chose and the quality of sound / and fits in my luggage when traveling. Very important I’m my travel life it’s a must,2019,05
Have previous experience with jbl and it was a natural choice to buy this. I was not disappointed,2019,05
Got this as a gift. Sounds OK. Gets loud and had decent bass. Couldn't get over the mono speaker which I found to be annoying.,2019,05
"This has less sound outputand quality than a JBL flip 2! I'm extremely disappointed with this model. It's mono and if the JBL logo isn't pointing in your exact direction you don't get much sound. Don't even bother with the hassle of trying this, I did it for you...",2019,05
I bought this to play music to my daughters. They enjoy to listen to their favorite songs here. The sounds is of good quality and fills the entire living room in our home. I believe battery runs for about two days when we listen to music all day. I recommend it. It is the perfect size to take it on a trip.,2019,05
"This speaker has excellent sound quality.  The battery has great life - we had it playing for a party recently, and it still showed 50% life after 7 hours.  It is a great value for the price point",2019,05
"This is such a huge upgrade from my old speakers! The sound quality is sharp and the volume is loud enough that my neighbors might complain if I keep this up! Got the red color, which I’m very happy with as well",2019,05
Excellent speaker,2019,05
Amazing speaker 10/10,2019,05
"I dislike that I now want to buy another one; however, I like that I want to buy another one! Awesome speaker!",2019,05
"I'm very surprised by this speaker.  I did a lot of research ahead of time and decided on this one as it's highly regarded.  I've heard several different BT speakers and none sounded this good, I'm extremely satisfied with the bass output.  It's best if used a few feet away from you as it sounds better.  Had it outside last night during a rainstorm, it was basically getting misted on for hours, but no ill effects.  You will not be dissatisfied.",2019,05
Awesome Little Speaker. Perfect mix of being portable with good quality sound. Very happy with this little guy.,2019,05
"I had the jbl flip 4 then bought this. Ironically, the sound is much better on the flip than the charge. It isn’t bad but not the best for jbl.",2019,05
We have really enjoyed the speaker next to the pool and we took it to the river with us over 4th of July weekend!!,2019,05
"I was scared to purchase this speaker, I'm so glad I did. The this speaker works great. Sounds great,",2019,05
Great sound. My family loves it.,2019,05
"It's very worth the prime day sale price and nearly worth retail selling price. Sound quality is very nice, and can hear low frequency bass very well. Very easy to connect to and doubles as a power bank if you need to charge your phone. Have not tested the water resistance, but many others have, i'd look up videos testing it. Recommend this over other speakers in its price range, but definitely get a case for it.",2019,05
package was opened and parts were missing. i had a charging cable bu no other parts. i paid fo a new product,2019,05
Amazing sound for the price,2019,05
Ok speaker. Great battery life. Sound got distorted when it was turned up full. Mine quit working all together a little after 3 months.,2019,05
The JBL speaker is a very good high quality speaker. The speaker sounds great and I like it because it's also waterproof and I would recommend this to my family and friends. I also like the other feature where you can play another JBL speaker at the same time. And I would probably buy another one as well.,2019,05
Excelente producto!!,2019,05
"Great sound, long battery life, waterproof, everything you could want in a portable speaker.",2019,05
"Bought this to replace a Bose soundlink I lost on a trip. After a month of use it’s no contest. The JBL has better sound, better battery life, and is way louder if you need it. Great purchase!",2019,05
Great product great sound,2019,05
"Although I just yesterday ordered the JBL Charge 4 and so haven't received it yet, I did some research into how the device charges.On one end of the charging cable is the new (and better) type of USB connector (USB C), and on the other, the standard (well familiar) USB connector.The charging port on the speaker only accepts the new type of USB connector known as USB C, not the standard USB that we are well familiar with.HOWEVER, the unit comes supplied with a 2-sided cable that WILL plug into a standard USB port, such as on most or all home and office computers, and also (some) AC wall chargers. The speaker does NOT come with this necessary USB-accepting AC wall charger. So if you do not have one already, you'd have to buy one someplace. Otherwise, simply plug it into a USB port on a computer.The new type of USB connector (USB C) is better because it is the SAME all around. That is, you no longer need to worry if the jack is orientated properly before inserting. It'll work no matter which way you plug it in, a much convenient design over the old.I think, but am not sure, that it MIGHT also work faster than the old and familiar USB connector. However, at least as of now, there is still a standard USB connector on the other end of the cable. So perhaps the faster charging speeds, assuming I'm even correct on this, might only be the case when these cables have the new type of USB (USB C) connectors on BOTH ends. In any case, as is, it's still better than the standard USB because of not having to fumble around when attempting to plug it in.Not only is it annoying fumbling around with the old (standard) USB connectors, the fumbling can actually damage the insides of a USB port due to repeated attempts at trying to insert an improperly orientated connector. Like trying to force a square peg into a round hole, after a while, the inners of the port will get bent out of shape. However, this is much more of a problem with the standard MINI-USB connectors commonly used with mobile phones and many other small devices.",2019,05
Absolutely love this JBL,2019,05
Love it..,2019,05
Love it,2019,05
We love the ease of use and sound quality of this speaker!,2019,05

Exactly what I wanted! Great sound! Battery lasts forever.,2019,05
The sound quality is great. I use them out at our condo pool.,2019,05
Best portable speaker!!! The quality is amazing and so practical.,2019,05

"It works, feels, and sounds like a JBL should. No complains about mono-sound.",2019,05
great sound and impressive battery life,2019,05
"Love it! You should get one! Great battery life, I’ve had it for months and use it everyday and have only charged it twice.",2019,05
I love connecting two of these bad boys or more. You can connect upto 100 of these guys!,2019,05
"Great bass at low volume, way louder than my ue boom.  Good buy.",2019,05
Jbl did it again. Another excellent speaker just like all the rest. Nice,2019,04
connected this speaker to a bluetooth transmitter connected to my control amp. Great sound outside on the patio.  Very easy to use. Can be used to charge your phone.,2019,04
My grandson talked me into this purchase and have to say I am enjoying it. Sound is pretty good for a portable small speaker. Battery life is good so far. I can usually get about 5 days of from morning till night out of a full charge.  I feel satisfied with the charge 3 purchases.,2019,04
this speaker produces the bass that most small speakers don't,2019,04
Is perfect for jamming out in the pool!,2019,04
I love the JBL speaker so much it works so good and I just love it all around it's a very great speaker the connectivity is a little slow but that doesn't stop me from listening to my jams!,2019,04
My son loves his speaker... it goes everywhere with him!,2019,04
Love the sound. It's the same size as the Charge 3.........Superb sound,2019,04
Long battery life and great sound quality!,2019,04
This speaker is absolutely the BEST!!!,2019,04
"I love the quality and power that JBL delivers, they never leave you hanging there. It was delivered promptly, the box was undamaged, the packaging the speaker came in was pristine, and the product itself was clean, as ordered, and has exceeded expectations. I would definitely buy this again, or even the bigger/better model!",2019,04
"Great sound, great battery, strong construction, fits well in packs. If you've done the research you know the differences between what you are looking for. If you haven't and skipped to reviews... sound is better than the charge 3, not as big or loud as the extreme but still impressive, fatter and more rugged than the flip. JBL is a good brand.",2019,04
"Very long battery life, bass can drown out treble at high volumes.",2019,04
My second!  Great sound quality and easy to use.,2019,04
Best little speaker. Definitely recommend.,2019,04
"Great sound, battery life and connectivity!",2019,04

"The battery life is amazing. The sound is great, I take it with me to the beach all the time. Great purchase.",2019,04
"Shipment time was good, product is as listed, couldn’t be happier.",2019,04
Speaker was a perfect addition to our home whether you’re listening to music by the pool out by the garage or in the shower!!,2019,04
"It always turn off after 5 min use, once this happens it works normal",2019,04
Would buy again,2019,04
Very good,2019,04
Amazing sound and battery life also worth buying several as they link up,2019,04
"I love the water resistance, long battery, high volume, and bass for such a small speaker. Also the ability to charge my phone off of it is great. Just wish it was a tad bit smaller and dedicated forward/back buttons but otherwise exceptional.",2019,04
This speaker sounds clean and has good base,2019,04
Sounds amazing and battery is great!,2019,04
Great sound for what it is. We use it mostly by the pool and so don't cart it around much but it'd be plenty light to take camping or to the beach.Charging port failed within first year even without water exposure.,2019,04
won't recharge after owning it for about 3 months.  Only used it a hand full of times.,2019,04
Very portable. The sound is amazing and I’m loving the bright red color.,2019,04
Great speaker but pre opened box.,2019,04
This is out second one - we have them linked and the sound is great - highly recommend!,2019,04
"listen i love jbl.. and although it is a good speaker i was scammed. it has only one built in speaker as opposed to the 2 they usually have, and this was a higher price. disappointing .. still a good speaker, but i was a little mad.",2019,02
"Great value for money. For an average user like me I think this is great value .. the Bose sound link has the 360 degree sound but its 300 .. about 200 bucks more. Im willing to sacrifice that for the price . Plus this is  waterproof and can be taken to the beach , pool and shower",2019,03
This speaker has great sound quality.  It is easy to use and very good quality overall.  My son bring it everywhere.,2019,03
So many uses!,2019,03
"This is my second charge 4. One sounds good, sounds great with two paired up! Love the portability.",2019,03
Great speaker,2019,03
I really like this speaker. It hooks up east and sounds great. I would buy it again,2019,03
Great battery life and I put water on the bass part and it didn’t damage the speaker at all. Instead it made a pretty cool effect when I played a song with heavy bass,2019,03
Perfect,2019,03
Broken when received,2019,03
Great sound! Easy to use! Don't know about battery yet.,2019,03
Awesome!  Will definitely purchase again.,2019,03
Bought this for my husband for Father's Day....he loves it!,2019,03
I expected more but not bad,2019,03
The sound is fantastic. Control buttons are convenient and work easily with little effort. Love that there were so many colors to choose from.,2019,03
Honestly I love it  it’s totally worth it  Iv had this for a month I take it on bike rides it got wet multiple times still works keep it near the pool really loud  it connects easily  charges my phone fast  and still holds a battery life,2019,03
Nice speaker. Good range for Bluetooth connection. I can go a good ways away and it still works.,2019,03
Excellent,2019,03
"Best portable speaker I've owned out of 6. I purposely tested the waterproofing in a snow/sleet storm overnight, 2 months later it works like new still. Use it at work, the beach, the backyard and anywhere I don't use my headphones really. The sound carries very well in open areas, the bass carries alright but it still has it's limits as a portable. The battery life is at least 20 hrs of nearly consistent music and I think maybe a half phone charge as well. Everybody that sees it wants one.",2019,03
Awesome bass! I tested this speaker at my local electronics store and then bought it here :D Didnt test the waterproof ability cause I'd generally rather not do that. Satisfied!,2019,03
Great sound and last for a long time without needing to keep charging it.,2019,03
It stopped working after 8 months. I can’t even return it.,2019,03
Awesome...its has a really nice base...very loud for its size,2019,03
Everything,2019,03
"This speaker is a service members dream. Its ""tatical"" which basically boils down to the colors match Army gear. This is a win win for soldiers and a nice thoughtful consideration that JBL made when releasing it in Sand. When times get sucky and everyone is feeling homesick, some good tunes from this bring morale up. I'm happy to say it fits in my gear and I carry it as an accountable item at all times. Durability seems high. Have had for 2 months now and hopefully for much longer.",2019,03
Love,2019,03
Bought this for kayaking after trying some other cheaper brands I tried this and I can't say enough about sounds quality.  The bass hits hard for a portable speaker and this gets loud like real loud!  Love it and the battery life is second to none,2019,03
Granddaughter loves it,2019,03
"Such boom for the buck!  Bought one, then after hearing it I ordered a second!!",2019,03
Great sound and battery life. The base was very impressive for a speaker this size. Took it into the pool with no worries. The feature of it being used as a charger also came in handy. I recommend this speaker.,2019,03
Excelente producto,2019,03
"JBL uses a non standard charging port. If you misplace your cord none of the hundreds of other charging cords you have laying around will work.I knew about this and (no surprise) I still managed to misplace it.My tone is polite, but I’m actually seething about this tired old engineered money grab tactic.Thousands on thousands of other manufacturers chose a standard, readily available port and cord. To hell with you for not doing the same. At this stage in the game it’s just good sense and basic common courtesy.",2019,03
Quality and premium sound!,2019,03
"I can’t say enough good things about this speaker! After months of heavy use at home and outdoors it still looks and sounds like new. It’s loud enough to use at parties, yet small enough to carry around. The battery seems to last forever. I listen to it all day and use it to charge my phone; I only have to charge my speaker once a week!",2019,03
"JBL Xtreme 2 has better sound quality and would be tons better than two of these in stereo. Unless you're going for a stereo image, two of these wouldn't be bad for the money, though you'll have worse quality audio. If money isn't an issue, two Xtreme 2's in stereo is the best option.You cannot use a flip 4 with a charge 4 to use stereo. Speakers need to be the same to utilize stereo mode.",2019,02
"good price works well, can survive long drops",2019,02
"Update 7/10/19 - Definitely a noticeable sound differences between the 2 speakers.  The S model is flatter and doesn't get as loud as the J model, it also has a muffled sound to it.  So far I have received bad customer service from JBL.  The seller I bought from (Electronics Expo - an authorized dealer) has a 2 week return policy so I'm outside of that and thus far JBL won't even admit they are selling 2 different models to customers.  I sent pictures and even links to FCC filing pages and the customer service reps don't even acknowledge it.  They want me to do factory resets and firmware updates.  It's different hardware!!! All they offered me was some 30% coupon and told me to deal with the seller.  This is the last time I'll ever purchase a JBL product and surely will urge friends and family to steer clear of them as well.Original - (Pictures Included) Just so people are aware.  There are 2 different models of the actual speaker you may get with this.  It seems legitimate based on the FCC filings page, but I want people to understand in case they notice differences like I did when I put them side by side.  The model number on the box itself is the same (JBLCHARGE4BLKAM), but JBL is shipping 2 different speakers inside the box and not telling people.  There is a S model and a J model.  The boxes themselves are nearly identical besides the small QR code next to the serial number on the model S.  If you open the charging port flap and look on the left side next to the serial number, you will see which one you have.  Now if you only order one speaker, you'd probably never know, but if you order 2 of them and receive 2 different models, the differences are obvious.(CHARGE4S) The S looks to be the older model.  According to FCC filings this has a 7800mah battery inside.  From my personal observations the mesh on the outside is thicker and you cannot see through it at all.  It also feels a bit heavier in the hand.  I don't have a digital scale to measure exactly but it's definitely more dense.  The charging indicator lights are also much brighter (you can see this in the pictures).(CHARGE4J) The J seems to be the newer model.  This is the model that actually has a 7500mah battery inside.  The mesh is not as thick on this model and you can easily see the speaker components inside.  Also, the charging lights on this model are much dimmer compared to the S.  It feels a bit lighter in the hand as well.I haven't put them through the ringer yet to see if there are audio differences.  It would be very disappointing if there are.  So buyer beware.  JBL is selling 2 different speakers with different battery sizes that potentially sound different, but they are marketing it as the same product!  Wish I would have known this before I bought them.",2019,03
The sound is not that great. It sounds like my JBL flip 4.,2019,03
Love that speaker. Last me whole day at work. Plus can charge my phone when needed.,2019,03
Fantastic sound and perfect portable sizzle.,2019,03
"Good sound , all my coworkers want one or two . Bought this for camping, can hide this behind a log and start my show going to freak them out! Lol . This will do the job my son has his and the sink up easy to operate",2019,03
"I was looking for something to use outside started to buy speakers and buy a bluetooth transmitter for around $300 total, then I saw these and it fit the bill plus its portable and the others would not be.",2019,03
This is a great speaker and the phone charging feature is awesome.  Sound quality is great for the size.,2019,03
Sound is awesome. Great depth from treble to bass. Gets loud but not muffled like cheap speakers. Battery goes forever.,2019,03
Best portable speaker by far enclosed areas are key for the bass to hit just right.,2019,03
Great Sound,2019,03
"This speaker actually lives up to its advertisements! The sound is clear and loud, the battery life has lasted 20 hours on multiple occasions all for a decent price. I've recommended it to all my friends, specifically the ones that went the ultra-cheap route.",2019,03
Great speakers just don’t use them to charge your phone it drains the batteryCharge only on emergency,2019,03
Folks? This speaker is amazing. It really is waterproof. I accidentally ran it through my front-loader washing machine in a load of pool towels. Still plays great. Awesome.,2019,03
Awesome sound and bass.,2019,03
I take this bad boy everywhere. Great for cross country/ track team workouts and gatherings. Dumping water on the sides to make a bass fountain is pretty cool too.,2019,03
Great speaker sound good,2019,03
The best speaker for the price fast shipping!!,2019,02
I like the sound and baterry life,2019,02
"UPDATE: after 1 year of not so actively using it, does not make any sound. We did not use it much, I had to charge battery once or twice in total. The last time battery died and after charging it, it does not make any sound at all. (I think it was a second time I had to charge) Other functions like bluetooth, light and +- buttons are working though.Tried to upgrade software by downloading and connecting mobile app, but no result  whatsoever.I am really disappointed about that, do not even know what to do keep it or get rid of it----------------------------------------------------------------------easy to use, descent sound quality and battery performance.Usability: bluetooth connection -easily discoverable, easily usable even for non-tech-at-all peopleSound Quality: Bass and high notes sound clear with very pleasant deep bass.Battery Performance: I do not know if that is a standard, but my one was decently charged right from the box and played for several hours non-stop without any additional charge. Battery charges fast and lasts as promised.P.s. will need special cover / holder for it to carry and keep safe&comfortablyWould highly recommend.",2019,02
Great sound quality and awesome that it comes in pink,2019,02
I like I like I like it a lot.,2019,02
product perfect .. this is upgrade for me.  operating instructions suck,2019,02
Sound quality is amazing you don’t even have to turn up the volume all the way up to hear the bass!,2019,02
This product is everything that they claim  it to be . It has excellent sound awesome bass and is very east to connect via Bluetooth. It holds a charge for 20 hrs and takes just a couple of hrs to fully recharge,2019,02
Good for playing music,2019,02
Really amazing sound for the size. My living room is about 20x15' and it rocks it!,2019,02
I placed it under a gentle stream of water and it continued playing.,2019,02
Best little speaker,2019,02
Nice speaker,2018,12
"I purchased the JBL Charge 4 because of reviews.  I had also purchased a UE Megaboom (not the newer Megaboom3). The two were equally priced, so it came down to sound and features. The JBL allows for charging a device, and for using a plug-in direct jack instead of Bluetooth. I thought those were more important when I ordered it, until I listened to them side by side. I had 3 listeners and switched back and forth between them using same songs. The other 2 listeners liked the Megaboom better, but couldn't identify why. I found the Megaboom to have tighter bass, and much better transparent mids and highs. The Charge4 sounded muddy in lows/mids/highs in comparison. Alone it can sound okay, as long as you don't have competitive reference.  Sound quality beat out battery charging and the Aux input.",2019,02
"As a woman in today’s society it is hard to find the time to clean and cook, but now having a speaker that plays my audio of choice, it definitely  helps to motivate those actions! Can’t wait to clean next Saturday!!!This is awesome it can go any where with you and is water resistant... hhello shower concerts!!**Simply hook up your Bluetooth device to the speaker and your ready!",2019,02
"I have purchased 2 of these for my kids.... now I ""borrow"" them all the time when sitting out by the pool or going to the beach. Great sound quality and very simple to set up. highly recommend.",2019,02
Beach use,2019,02
"Was deciding between this and UE boom..went with the boom first..and it just didnt have that deep bass and sound i personally like..but this charge 4 does! Night and day on that..battery im not sure yet haven't ran it more than 5 hrs at a time, but so far no issues..glad i got this one",2019,02
Was looking for a speaker to blast out the neighbors who sit too close at the beach.  I think I found it in the jbl  charge 4.  Stay tuned....,2019,02
I upgraded from a JBL flip 4 that couldn't hold a charge after about 2 years. I was hesitant about buying a speaker that has only 1 driver but so far I have zero complaints. I run speakers hard at my job and this one has no difficulty at all keeping up with the challenges I give it. It has a huge battery that will certainly last you for hours. I have currently used it for roughly 7 hours at work today at higher volumes and it claims to still be near a full charge. Only time will tell. Another cool thing these speakers can do is connect to other speakers that have the same JBL connect+ feature. Other coworkers have compatible speakers that they love to hook up to it and it certainly turns work into a party! I would highly recommend this speaker if you're looking for something that puts out a high volume and has a great battery life!,2019,02
I am sorry my fault.,2019,02
"My buddy 3d printed me some mounts for my can am maverick x3 xmr turbo, and the speakers is plenty loud enough for me to hear on the trail and battery lasted all day and then some.",2019,02
"I have been a musician my entire life and this thing sounds like utter garbage compared similar JBL speakers.  The one speaker is just horrible.  Go to a store and try for yourself, even the old Link 20 is better sounding.",2019,02
"The JBL charge 4 is a great product. I found it to be initially disappointing due to the warm sound signature. I have found that the highs aren’t totally accurate but they’re close enough to not distract you from the music. The highs are present but definitely aren’t strong which adds to the warm signature. The mids are very good and exceptionally clear for the size of this device. Because of this, the vocals are great in most songs. They are well represented unless they sneak up on the high notes which is when you can hear a slight distortion from accuracy. However, the vocals which dip into lower range sound really good as the speaker does a great job not to put too much emphasis on the radiators making it sound bassy and unrealistic. If you listen to high quality hifi tracks you’ll be able to imagine the singer right in front of you because of the presence and sound stage. As for the mono speaker, don’t listen to the critics of this new implementation because most of them either don’t know what they’re talking about or they are just picking at it because they don’t like the thought of it. You’re not going to get stereo by using 2 speakers 3 inches apart like on the last model and as for separation, this mono speaker separates just fine if not better than the last model especially in mid to lows. The speaker gets plenty loud for the average person and it manages to maintain its dynamics all the way to just under full volume. I’ve compared this speaker to many others such as charge 3, xb30, xb31, xb20, extreme, onyx... and what I’ve found is that while the highs are a bit lacking in certain songs it certainly makes up for it in other departments. The bass is very good in the charge 4. The bass notes are represented accurately and it’s able to hit lower frequencies most portable speakers of this size can’t (20). However, it’s worth mentioning it’s still no sub. This speaker has trouble representing very low frequencies. The radiators start shaking instead of making music which for those of you who don’t know (this doesn’t sound very good). The battery life of this speaker wasn’t as advertised and I found I could only get 9 hours on 60 percent volume which isn’t bad but is a huge deviation from the claimed 20 hours. After using this speaker for awhile and comparing it to other speakers, I’ve actually grown fond of this unit and it’s become my beach toy. Don’t take any critics in this review too seriously as I doubt most people are 50% as critical as me when it comes to audio but this one gets my thumbs up. Future improvements would definitely require a tweeter and possibly a bigger battery.",2019,02
"I never looked into JBL before this.  Sound quality is amazing.  Durability is top notch.  It is sleek and not to bulky.  I have not tested out the waterproof part but I think leave that for another time. The battery lasts a very long time, like it says 20+hrs.  It's also a great backup portable charger for my phone.  I kinda wish I got the bigger one just because I really liked this brand.  This is me saying this not someone telling me to say it, but if you like protecting your things I would also get the carrying case.  I will upload a picture at another time.",2019,02
This speaker is quite a bit larger/heavier than I expected but the sound is incredible. Well worth it.,2019,02
There is supposed to be a charger included. No charger or even a user manual was included.,2019,02
This was a gift for my mom. Good choice. Gets some really good sound when plugged in. Nice crisp bass,2019,02
Like everything about it,2019,02
"Not to many wireless mid-range Bluetooth speakers can hang with JBL, maybe Braven but that's about it. Bose is great but JBL got them on the bass in mid-size speakers.",2019,02
"Constantly disconnects from bluetooth, sometimes several times in one song.",2018,12
It’s perfect.,2018,12
"I had intended on buying a MegaBoom, but I got to test out this speaker along with a Boom and a MegaBoom, and the fullness of sound (in particular the quality of the bass) on this thing blew those two out of the water.The non-universal charge cord is a little annoying, but oh well.Don't expect to get Sub Bass out of this thing. It would have to be about 5 inches taller for that.",2019,01
Quality product,2019,01
"It's sounds pretty good, and I can take it anywhere, love it",2019,01
"Very excited for the speaker. I bought it to have on a weekend camping trip, but I didn't realize it was going to come without a full charger! Left me unable to charge it as my other charger doesn't disconnect into a block and a cord, it stays as one. I now have to buy wall block in order to charge this speaker I already spend a lot of money on. Seems like a real cheap way to save money as company.",2019,01
Crisp clear sound with great bass! I love being able to Bluetooth connect all of the JBL speakers to have them playing in all the rooms in the house.,2019,01
"I bought this item and sent to my brother overseas, he tried charging but the gadget was not charging.",2019,01
This speaker snaps and pops when at low volume and distorts when turned up. Tried multiple apps and devices but had the same result. A dud at over $100 is unacceptable. I would not recommend this product in any form or fashion.,2019,01
Excellent,2019,01
"Great sound and light carry. We can move it around and perfect for the back patio. We can use it and not worry about the kids splashing water from the water table, small pool, water hose, or slip and slide",2019,01
"My wife complains about how it charges, sometimes it doesn't get a full charge. That might have more to do with how she goes about it though. One concern to be aware of though is how the watertight flap can pinch the charging connection. She puts another USB cable into the out port to keep the flap off of the USB C in",2019,01
I like too much I loved,2019,01
I have only had this speaker approximately one month - but it will not hold a charge so I am somewhat disappointed,2019,01
Love the sound. Great as a charge source too!,2019,01

"My brother has a pair of JBL Extremes and they sound great outdoors.  I didn't want to go that big (and expensive)  so after some research I purchased a pair of Charge 4's, one from Amazon with points  and one from a Meijer store at a big discount.  I knew that separately they are mono but planned on getting two.  I paired them with my iphone, downloaded the Connect+ app and tried them out in my breezeway and wasn't terribly impressed but that room has cedar walls and ceiling and all hard furniture, so I moved out to the patio. Incredible sound!  I played some Aaron Diehl, Tom Waits, Jade Bird, several genres.  Exceeded my expectations!After listening to just one speaker I would say this might not be what you want if you're going to use one solo. I would probably consider the Charge 3 in that case, but if you connect at least two speakers for stereo sound you won't be disappointed.",2019,01
It’s a jbl nothing more to say,2019,01
JBL flip 4 is sufficient. Although I loved the green this one size bigger didn't have any otheradvantages over the flip other than the color. Kept the flip...sent this one back.,2019,01
"Great speaker. And great seller.  Only con I have found with this speaker is, only having 1 ""driver"" /speaker, it looses the stereo effect of the charge 3, which has two very slightly smaller speakers.  The low tones are better and deeper w the charge 4, but it looses alot of high tones.  The charge 3 picks them up great.  I'll be ordering a 3 in near future to link with the 4, for a full rounded sound.  But, the bass is a lot better with the 4. Still really good sound and great volume eith the 4",2019,01
"update: 6/4/2019 From 3 Stars to 4Was having trouble with the JBL connect app but now I got it figured out. Do not have more than 2 connected devices at one time otherwise the app will not work.Once the app worked I could now turn off the audio prompt which was annoying when especially you don't want to disturb anyone.  Now the start up and volume either reached maximum or minimum does not give me the unwanted feedback. Nice!Note:My experience with this speaker was less than 12 hrs.  Also it didn't been through water test just so you guys know.Only single sound driver?? I could tell sound was coming from more from the right side when I had the speaker 2-3 feet away from me and that's my preferred use. That was already a little unpleasant. Next issue was the JBL Connect App didn't work at all. It couldn't find the speaker.  What??Lastly and most importantly, I used my speaker a lot listening to audio book before I go to bed.  When this speaker volume was down to say maybe 5% or so, I could hear random breaking up background noise coming off it.  That was my last draw and unfortunately had to return it.What I would like to is that the light indicator can be controlled via the app but since I couldn't use the app, I wasn't sure if the light indicator could be off or dim somehow.  It is way too bright and unnecessary. Also if possible a LED indicator to show the level of the current volume. It does not have to permanently turned on but fade away after a second or two that will be way better.JBL. JBL. Oh no.",2019,01
Very pleased.,2019,01
Great product,2018,12
All around solid. Best $120 dollar investment I’ve made.,2018,12
Really good,2018,12
"Terrible, not even stereo!!! The cheaper flip had significantly better sound quality. Please don’t waste your time or money get the flip instead",2018,12
Love this speaker. Great battery life great sound.,2018,12
Great product. Took up north and we were able to sync three speakers together. Sound is wonderful.,2018,12
Sound stunning  and great bass for it's size compact speaker,2018,12
So its a bit to much base for the how much sound even with some movies n i think 99.99 would he more like it but im cheap so idk its seems to be a bit heavy on the positives decent battery good base durable havnt put it in water afraid too do to the cover being put back on looks to not go back on the way i would like it to,2018,12
Very Good Sound,2018,12
The best sound in a portable speaker,2018,11
Not sure about the battery life as I just got it and haven't used it for any length of time.  The seller however was efficient and it seems like a decent value at the price point.,2018,11
"For some reason I ordered red and got grey, but other than that, the sound is great and the battery lasts a long time. I took it on two beach/pool trips and it was great",2018,11
Excelente producto,2018,11
Great sound,2018,11
Much more than I expected sound is awesome and built very well,2018,11
Good quality,2018,11
Ok,2018,10
"Speaker has clean sound just not loud enough to justify the increase in price.  the sound was a huge disappointment, if you like anything loud don't buy the speaker stay with the charge 3",2018,10
"Charge 4 is perfect. Someone says the issues about the mono speaker, but I think it has higher quality than last generation. Cause two speakers are two close that the stereo cannot show in accurate steps.So I think It's a good idea to buy it.By the way, from the USA to Korea only takes 8 days, the ships are so great.",2018,10
